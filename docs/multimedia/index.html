				<h1>Tooth Enamel</h1>
				<p>Many of the Coca Cola and Pepsi brand sodas contain extremely large amounts of acid used to ensure prolonged carbonation. The acids found in sodas are as corrosive as battery acid, one of the strongest acids. The Erosive potential of soda is 10 times larger than that of common fruit juice after 3 minutes of exposure. Teeth immersed in Coke, Pepsi, 7 Up, RC Cola, Squirt, Surge, and Diet 7 Up lost more than 5% of their weight after 48 hours. After a mere 2,400 hours or 100 days, teeth submerged in these sodas will be completely dissolved. The most acidic soda has a pH of 2.3 on the (0-14) pH scale. For comparison battery acid has a pH of 1 and water has a 7.</p>

				<h1>Sugar Overload</h1>
				<p>Twenty minutes after consuming a soda, your blood sugar will spike resulting in an insulin burst. Your liver responds to this by converting any sugar into fat immediately. If other items such as French Fries and Burgers are consumed with soda, the resulting insulin burst converts a majority of the simple sugars directly into fat. Forty minutes later, caffeine absorption is complete. Your pupils dilate, your blood pressure rises, and as a result your liver dumps more sugar into your bloodstream. The adenosine receptors in your brain are now blocked preventing drowsiness. Forty five minutes later your body ups dopamine production stimulating the pleasure centers of your brain. This is physically the same way heroin and cocaine work.</p>

				<h1>Heart Disease</h1>
				<p>Those who drink soda have almost a 50% higher chance of heart disease than those who do not. Blood sugar and glycemic load are risk factors from consuming sugary drinks which eventually lead to heart problems. Soda is closely linked to obesity developed from the continuous sugar overload cycles. Obesity is the leading cause of heart disease in the world.</p>

				<h1>Obesity</h1>
				<p>Obesity is the accumulation of excess body fat to the extent that it has a negative effect on health. Most common causes of obesity are diet, sedentary lifestyle, genetics, external illnesses, social determinants, and infection agents. Soda is usually a main component of a diet leading to  eventual obesity. Obesity in many cases leads to disease though placing strain on many of the systems crucial of human life.</p>

Obesity places pressure on the respiratory system since as the body expands blood needs to travel a greater area over the body. Obesity places a strain across all of the bodies systems.</p>

				<h1>Osteoporosis</h1>
				<p>Osteoporosis is a disease where decreased bone strength leads to the increased risk of broken or fractured bones. Excessive soda drinking decreases bone strength due to the acidic contents. Similar to dissolving tooth enamel, soda can completely decompose human bones if given an extend amount of time. Those who drink soda frequently are constantly exposing their bones to acid that is essentially dissolving one of the most important systems for mortality.</p>

				<p>Frequent sugar overload cycles common leads into Type II Diabetes. Type II Diabetes is characterised as a metabolic disorder where the body produces too little insulin to lower blood sugar levels. It is commonly accepted that obesity and excessive sugar consumption are leading factors to developing Type II Diabetes.</p>

				<h1>Kidney Failure</h1>
				<p>Sodas contain high levels of phosphoric acid which has been linked to kidney stones and renal failure. Most substances consumed pass through the kidneys for filtration however certain substances can shutdown the kidneys due to intolerance. Kidneys are crucial to the body because they filter toxic chemicals. On hemodialysis humans can live with kidney failure until the transplant board allows a transplant however the transplant board does not give organs to humans who have been damaged due to self harm.</p>
