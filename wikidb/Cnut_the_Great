53.0	Cnut_the_Great	Cnut the Great	Cnut the Great (Old Norse: Knútr inn ríki; c. 985 or 995 – 12 November 1035), also known as Canute, was a king of Denmark, England, Norway and parts of Sweden. Though after the death of his heirs within a decade of his own and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, his legacy was largely lost to history, historian Norman F. Cantor has made the paradoxical statement that he was "the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/U_194%2C_V%C3%A4sby.JPG/220px-U_194%2C_V%C3%A4sby.JPG
