When in Munich in the 1970s, he started his own record label called Oasis Records, which several years later became a subdivision of Casablanca Records. His work with synthesizers during the 1970s and 1980s had a significant influence on New Wave, house, techno and electronic music in general. Particularly well known for his work with Donna Summer during the era of disco (including "Love to Love You Baby" and "I Feel Love"), Moroder is the founder of the former Musicland Studios in Munich, which was used as a recording studio for artists including Electric Light Orchestra, Led Zeppelin, Queen and Elton John.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Giorgio_Moroder.jpg/220px-Giorgio_Moroder.jpg
