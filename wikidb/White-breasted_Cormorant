3.11	White-breasted_Cormorant	White-breasted Cormorant	The White-breasted Cormorant is a member of the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae. It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of the Great Cormorant, in which case it is referred to as Phalacrocorax carbo lucidus. However some authorities (e.g. Sibley &amp; Monroe, 1990, Sinclair, Hockey and Tarboton, 2002) retain its original treatment as an allospecies in the P. carbo superspecific group, in which case it is referred to as Phalacrocorax lucidus. A black-necked form originally classified as Phalacrocorax patricki or Phalacrocorax carbo patricki is now regarded as synonymous with this taxon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/White-breasted-cormorant.jpg/220px-White-breasted-cormorant.jpg
