63.7	Neutral_density_filter	Neutral density filter	In photography and optics, a neutral density filter or ND filter can be a colorless (clear) or grey filter. An ideal neutral density filter reduces and/or modifies intensity of all wavelengths or colors of light equally, giving no changes in hue of color rendition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Strickland_Falls_Shadows_Lifted.jpg/220px-Strickland_Falls_Shadows_Lifted.jpg
