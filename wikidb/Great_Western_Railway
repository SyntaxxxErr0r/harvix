51.1	Great_Western_Railway	Great Western Railway	The Great Western Railway (GWR) was a British railway company that linked London with the south-west and west of England and most of Wales. It was founded in 1833, received its enabling Act of Parliament in 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838. It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who chose a broad gauge of in (2,140 mm) but, from 1854, a series of amalgamations saw it also operate in (1,435 mm) standard-gauge trains; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892. The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921, which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory, and it was finally wound up at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Great_Western_Railway.png/220px-Coat_of_arms_of_the_Great_Western_Railway.png
