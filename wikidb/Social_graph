194.2	Social_graph	Social graph	The social graph is a term coined by scientists working in the social areas of graph theory. It has been described as "the global mapping of everybody and how they're related". The term was popularized at the Facebook f8 conference on May 24, 2007, when it was used to explain that the Facebook Platform, which was introduced at the same time, would benefit from the social graph by taking advantage of the relationships between individuals, that Facebook provides, to offer a richer online experience. The definition has been expanded to refer to a social graph of all Internet users.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/6n-graf.svg/250px-6n-graf.svg.png
