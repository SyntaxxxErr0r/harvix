54.4	Neck	Neck	The neck is the part of the body, on many terrestrial or secondarily aquatic vertebrates, that distinguishes the head from the torso or trunk. The adjective (from Latin) signifying "of the neck" is cervical (though this more frequently used to describe the cervix).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Gray1195.png/250px-Gray1195.png
