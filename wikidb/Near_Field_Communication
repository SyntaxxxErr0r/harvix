147.9	Near_Field_Communication	Near field communication	Near field communication is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into close proximity, usually no more than a few centimetres. Present and anticipated applications include contactless transactions, data exchange, and simplified setup of more complex communications such as Wi-Fi. Communication is also possible between an NFC device and an unpowered NFC chip, called a "tag".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/NFC_touch_interactions_2.jpg/275px-NFC_touch_interactions_2.jpg
