Photos of his disfigured corpse spread throughout online communities and incited outrage over allegations that he was beaten to death by Egyptian security forces. A prominent Facebook group, "We are all Khaled Said", moderated by Wael Ghonim, brought attention to his death and contributed to growing discontent in the weeks leading up to the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. In October 2011, two Egyptian police officers were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to seven years in prison for beating Saeed to death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f5/Khaled_Mohamed_Saeed.jpg/220px-Khaled_Mohamed_Saeed.jpg
