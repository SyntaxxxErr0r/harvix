1.20	Retrolisthesis	Retrolisthesis	A retrolisthesis is a posterior displacement of one vertebral body with respect to the adjacent vertebrae to a degree less than a luxation (dislocation). Clinically speaking, retrolisthesis is the opposite of spondylolisthesis Retrolistheses are most easily diagnosed on lateral x-ray views of the spine. Views, where care has been taken to expose for a true lateral view without any rotation, offer the best diagnostic quality.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/RetrolistheseC35grade1.PNG/220px-RetrolistheseC35grade1.PNG
