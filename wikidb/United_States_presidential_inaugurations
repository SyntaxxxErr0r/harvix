Prior to the Twentieth Amendment, the date was March 4, the day of the year on which the Constitution of the United States first took effect in 1789; the last inauguration to take place on the older date was Franklin D. Roosevelt's first one on March 4, 1933. The day a presidential inauguration occurs is known as "Inauguration Day".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Inauguration-01-20-2009.jpg/220px-Inauguration-01-20-2009.jpg
