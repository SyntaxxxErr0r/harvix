94.1	Edgar_Degas	Edgar Degas	Edgar Degas (US: , UK: ; French: ;born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas, 1834â€“1917), was a French artist famous for his work in painting, sculpture, printmaking and drawing. He is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism although he rejected the term, and preferred to be called a realist. A superb draftsman, he is especially identified with the subject of the dance, and over half of his works depict dancers. These display his mastery in the depiction of movement, as do his racecourse subjects and female nudes. His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and depiction of human isolation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Edgar_Degas_self_portrait_1855.jpeg/285px-Edgar_Degas_self_portrait_1855.jpeg
