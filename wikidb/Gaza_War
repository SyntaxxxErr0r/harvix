99.7	Gaza_War	Gaza War	The Gaza War, known as Operation Cast Lead (‎) in Israel and as the Gaza Massacre (‎) or the Battle of al-Furqan (‎) in Gaza and by Hamas was a three-week armed conflict that took place in the Gaza Strip during the winter of 2008–2009 which started on December 27, 2008. Israel's stated aim was to stop rocket fire into Israel and arms import into the Gaza strip. After the beginning of the conflict, Palestinian groups continued firing rockets in response to what they characterized as "massacres". Israeli forces attacked police stations, military targets including weapons caches and suspected rocket firing teams as well as political and administrative institutions in the opening assault, striking in the densely populated cities of Gaza, Khan Younis and Rafah.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Gaza_conflict_map.png/300px-Gaza_conflict_map.png
