7.02	Williamite	Williamite	"Williamite" is sometimes applied to Late Stuart country house architecture built c 1690 - 1710 in the conservative classicising English tradition that had been established under Charles II by Hugh May and Sir Christopher Wren, of which Belton House, Lincolnshire, and, formerly Stoke Edith, Herefordshire are typical examples. Such compact houses do not fit easily within the conventions of English baroque architecture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Stoke_in_Herefordshire_Vit_Brit.jpg/220px-Stoke_in_Herefordshire_Vit_Brit.jpg
