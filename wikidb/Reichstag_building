72.9	Reichstag_building	Reichstag (building)	The Reichstag building is a historical edifice in Berlin, Germany, constructed to house the Reichstag, parliament of the German Empire. It was opened in 1894 and housed the Reichstag until 1933, when it was severely damaged in a fire. After World War II, the building fell into disuse, since the parliament of the German Democratic Republic met in the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin and the parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany met in the Bundeshaus in Bonn.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Reichstag_pano.jpg/220px-Reichstag_pano.jpg
