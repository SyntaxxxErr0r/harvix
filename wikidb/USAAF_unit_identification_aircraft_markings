The purpose of these markings was to provide a means of rapid identification of the unit to which an aircraft was assigned. Variations of these markings continue to be used in the United States Air Force in the form of tail codes identifying operational wings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/B-17-231503-bassingborne.jpg/300px-B-17-231503-bassingborne.jpg
