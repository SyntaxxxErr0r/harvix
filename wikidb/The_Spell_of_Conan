The material was originally published as articles in George H. Scithers' fanzine Amra. The book is a companion to Ace’s earlier volume of material from Amra, The Blade of Conan (1979). Most of the material in the two volumes, together with some additional material, was reprinted from three previous books issued in hardcover by Mirage Press; de Camp’s collection The Conan Reader (1968), and the de Camp and Scithers-edited anthologies The Conan Swordbook (1969). and The Conan Grimoire (1972).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/Spell_of_Conan.jpg
