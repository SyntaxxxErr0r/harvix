73.7	Roundabout	Roundabout	A roundabout is a type of circular intersection, a junction in which road traffic flows in one direction around a central island. In a roundabout, entering traffic must always yield to traffic already in the circle, and roundabouts have additional restrictions on the junction layout to give high safety. Roundabouts, in their modern form, were standardised in the UK, based on the experience of traffic circles in the U.S. but are now common in many countries around the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/NonUK_Roundabout_8_Cars.gif/230px-NonUK_Roundabout_8_Cars.gif
