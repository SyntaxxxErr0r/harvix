69.3	International_Date_Line	International Date Line	The International Date Line is an imaginary line on the surface of the Earth, that runs from the north to the south pole and demarcates one calendar day from the next. It passes through the middle of the Pacific Ocean, roughly following the 180Â° longitude but it deviates to pass around some territories and island groups.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/International_Date_Line.png/220px-International_Date_Line.png
