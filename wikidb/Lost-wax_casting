55.8	Lost-wax_casting	Lost-wax casting	Lost-wax casting sometimes called by the French name of cire perdue (from the Latin cera perduta) is the process by which a metal (such as silver, gold, brass or bronze) sculpture is cast from an artist's sculpture. Intricate works can be achieved by this method, primarily depending on the carver's skills. In industrial uses, the modern process is called investment casting. An ancient practice, the process today varies from foundry to foundry, but the steps which are usually used in casting small bronze sculptures in a modern bronze foundry are generally quite standardized.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Lost_Wax-Model_of_apple_in_wax.jpg/220px-Lost_Wax-Model_of_apple_in_wax.jpg
