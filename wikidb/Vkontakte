59.4	Vkontakte	VK (social network)	(Originally VKontakte, Russian: ) is a Russian social network service popular in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Belarus. VK offers a striking similarity in design and functionality to Facebook, and as such has been described as a "Facebook clone." Like Facebook, VK allows users to message contacts publicly or privately, create groups, public pages and events, make notes, share and tag images and video, and play browser-based games. One distinction of VK is its integration with torrent filesharing technology which allows users to share larger files.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Vkcom.png/239px-Vkcom.png
