2.00	Regional_Red_List	Regional Red List	A Regional Red List (RRL) is a report of the threatened status of species within a certain country or region. It is based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, an inventory of the conservation status of species on a global scale. Regional Red Lists assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit and therefore may feed directly into national and regional planning. This project is coordinated by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and partners in national governments, universities and organizations throughout the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Status_iucn3.1.svg/240px-Status_iucn3.1.svg.png
