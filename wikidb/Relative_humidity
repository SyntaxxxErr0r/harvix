56.7	Relative_humidity	Relative humidity	Relative humidity is a term used to describe the amount of water vapor in a mixture of air and water vapor. It is defined as the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor in the air-water mixture to the saturated vapor pressure of a flat sheet of pure water at those conditions. The relative humidity of air depends not only on temperature but also on the pressure of the system of interest. Relative humidity is often used instead of absolute humidity in situations where the rate of water evaporation is important, as it takes into account the variation in saturated vapor pressure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Umidaderelativa.jpg/220px-Umidaderelativa.jpg
