421.7	Social_media	Social media	Social media includes web-based and mobile technologies used to turn communication into interactive dialogue. Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define social media as "a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content." Social media is media for social interaction as a super-set beyond social communication. Enabled by ubiquitously accessible and scalable communication techniques, social media has substantially changed the way organizations, communities, and individuals communicate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/Social_Web_Share_Buttons.png/220px-Social_Web_Share_Buttons.png
