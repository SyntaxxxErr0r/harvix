1.00	Binbrook,_Ontario	Binbrook, Ontario	Binbrook is a small, but growing community in southeastern Hamilton, Ontario in Canada. It was unpopularly amalgamated into the City of Hamilton in 2001. Since 2001, Binbrook has added hundreds of new homes as it becomes an "island" suburb of Hamilton, separated by conservation and agricultural lands. Armstrong's General Store was a longtime centre of community activity as was the feed mill and, in the 1960s, Cybulski's Grocery Store. Knox Presbyterian Church is on the Eastern flank of the village, 400 m down Binbrook Road from the village center. On March 14, 2012, Tim Horton's opened right in the middle of the downtown area at Binbrook Road and Highway 56.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/BinbrookTownshipLocatorMap1818.jpeg/220px-BinbrookTownshipLocatorMap1818.jpeg
