185.1	Microsoft_Bob	Microsoft Bob	Microsoft Bob was a Microsoft software product, released in March 1995, although widely publicised prior to that date under the codename "Utopia", which provided a new, non-technical interface to desktop computing operations. It was one of Microsoft's more visible product failures. Microsoft's Steve Ballmer mentioned Bob as an example of a situation "where we decided that we have not succeeded and let's stop".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Microsoft_Bob.PNG
