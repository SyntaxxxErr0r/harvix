51.6	Cannabinoid_receptor	Cannabinoid receptor	The cannabinoid receptors are a class of cell membrane receptors under the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. As is typical of G protein-coupled receptors, the cannabinoid receptors contain seven transmembrane spanning domains. Cannabinoid receptors are activated by three major group of ligands, endocannabinoids (produced by the mammalian body), plant cannabinoids (such as THC, produced by the cannabis plant) and synthetic cannabinoids (such as HU-210). All of the endocannabinoids and plant cannabinoids are lipophilic, i.e. fat soluble, compounds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Cb1_cb2_structure.png/237px-Cb1_cb2_structure.png
