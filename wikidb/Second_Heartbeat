1.00	Second_Heartbeat	Waking the Fallen	Waking the Fallen is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold, released on August 26, 2003 by Hopeless Records. It is the last release by the band to feature their metalcore sound, although more clean vocals are featured on the album than their debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. Considered the band's Magnum opus, it is also the first album to feature Johnny Christ on bass, thus completing the band's primary lineup (until The Rev's death in 2009).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/WakingTheFallen.jpg/220px-WakingTheFallen.jpg
