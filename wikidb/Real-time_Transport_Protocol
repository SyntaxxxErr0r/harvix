61.0	Real-time_Transport_Protocol	Real-time Transport Protocol	One of the design considerations of RTP was to support a range of multimedia formats (such as H.264, MPEG-4, MJPEG, MPEG, etc.) and allow new formats to be added without revising the RTP standard. The design of RTP is based on the architectural principle known as application level framing (ALF). The information required by a specific application's needs is not included in the generic RTP header, but is instead provided through RTP profiles and payload formats. For each class of application (e.g., audio, video), RTP defines a profile and one or more associated payload formats. A complete specification of RTP for a particular application usage will require a profile and payload format specification(s).:71
