152.6	Loch_Ness_Monster	Loch Ness Monster	The Loch Ness Monster (Scottish Gaelic: ) is a cryptid that is reputed to inhabit Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. Popular interest and belief in the animal has varied since it was brought to the world's attention in 1933. Evidence of its existence is anecdotal, with minimal and much-disputed photographic material and sonar readings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Loch_Ness_monster_views.svg/220px-Loch_Ness_monster_views.svg.png
