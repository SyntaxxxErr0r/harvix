60.4	The_Satanic_Verses	The Satanic Verses	The Satanic Verses is Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, first published in 1988 and inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. As with his previous books, Rushdie used magical realism and relied on contemporary events and people to create his characters. The title refers to the so-called "satanic verses", a group of alleged Quranic verses that allow intercessory prayers to be made to three Pagan Meccan goddesses: Allāt, Uzza, and Manāt. The part of the story that deals with the "satanic verses" was based on accounts from the 1st millennium historians al-Waqidi and al-Tabari.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/1988_Salman_Rushdie_The_Satanic_Verses.jpg
