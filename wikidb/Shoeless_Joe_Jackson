73.6	Shoeless_Joe_Jackson	Shoeless Joe Jackson	Joseph Jefferson Jackson (July 16, 1887 â€“ December 5, 1951), nicknamed "Shoeless Joe", was an American baseball player who played Major League Baseball in the early part of the 20th century. He is remembered for his performance on the field and for his association with the Black Sox Scandal, in which members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox participated in a conspiracy to fix the World Series. As a result of Jackson's association with the scandal, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Major League Baseball's first commissioner, banned Jackson from playing after the 1920 season.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/ShoelessJoeJackson.jpg/200px-ShoelessJoeJackson.jpg
