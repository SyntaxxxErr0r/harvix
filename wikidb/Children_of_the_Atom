Shiras, which has been listed as one of "The Most Significant SF &amp; Fantasy Books of the Last 50 Years, 1953-2002." The book is a collection and expansion of three earlier stories, the most famous of which is the novella "In Hiding" from 1948, which appeared on several "Best SF" lists. The book's plot, about super children with immeasurably high intelligence who have to hide their youth, and work from hiding in order to get along in the less-intelligent world, has been credited — though never officially confirmed — with providing the inspiration for the X-Men comic book series.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Children_of_the_Atom_first_edition_cover.jpg/200px-Children_of_the_Atom_first_edition_cover.jpg
