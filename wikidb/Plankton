84.1	Plankton	Plankton	Plankton (singular plankter) are any drifting organisms that inhabit the pelagic zone of oceans, seas, or bodies of fresh water. That is, plankton are defined by their ecological niche rather than phylogenetic or taxonomic classification. They provide a crucial source of food to larger, more familiar aquatic organisms such as fish and whales.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Plankton_collage.jpg/300px-Plankton_collage.jpg
