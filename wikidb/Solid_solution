8.12	Solid_solution	Solid solution	A solid solution is a solid-state solution of one or more solutes in a solvent. Such a mixture is considered a solution rather than a compound when the crystal structure of the solvent remains unchanged by addition of the solutes, and when the mixture remains in a single homogeneous phase. This often happens when the two elements (generally metals) involved are close together on the periodic table; conversely, a chemical compound is generally a result of the non-proximity of the two metals involved on the periodic table.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Solid_solution.svg/200px-Solid_solution.svg.png
