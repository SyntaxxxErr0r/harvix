133.9	L._Ron_Hubbard	L. Ron Hubbard	Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (March 13, 1911 â€“ January 24, 1986), better known as L. Ron Hubbard (and often referred to by his initials, LRH), was an American pulp fiction author and religious leader who founded the Church of Scientology. After establishing a career as a writer, becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories, he developed a self-help system called Dianetics which was first published in May 1950. He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and rituals as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology. His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/L._Ron_Hubbard_in_1950.jpg/220px-L._Ron_Hubbard_in_1950.jpg
