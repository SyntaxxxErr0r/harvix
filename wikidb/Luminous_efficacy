61.0	Luminous_efficacy	Luminous efficacy	Wavelengths of light outside of the visible spectrum are not useful for illumination because they cannot be seen by the human eye. Furthermore, the eye responds more to some wavelengths of light than others, even within the visible spectrum. This response of the eye is represented by the luminosity function. This is a standardized function which represents the response of a "typical" eye under bright conditions . One can also define a similar curve for dim conditions (scotopic vision). When neither is specified, photopic conditions are generally assumed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/CIE_1931_Luminosity.png/220px-CIE_1931_Luminosity.png
