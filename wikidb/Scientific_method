340.5	Scientific_method	Scientific method	Scientific method refers to a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on gathering empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. The Oxford English Dictionary says that scientific method is: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/PrirodneNauke.svg/100px-PrirodneNauke.svg.png
