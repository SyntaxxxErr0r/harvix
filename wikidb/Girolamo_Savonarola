77.1	Girolamo_Savonarola	Girolamo Savonarola	Girolamo Savonarola (21 September 1452 – 23 May 1498) was an Italian Dominican friar, a Scholastic, and an influential contributor to the politics of Florence from 1494 until his execution in 1498. He was known for his book burning, destruction of what he considered immoral art, and what he thought the Renaissance—which began in his Florence—ought to become. He preached vehemently against the moral corruption of much of the clergy at the time. His main opponent was Rodrigo Borgia, who was Pope Alexander VI from 1492, through Savonarola's death in 1498.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Girolamo_Savonarola.jpg/220px-Girolamo_Savonarola.jpg
