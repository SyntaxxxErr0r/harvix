12.01	CBS_Radio_Workshop	CBS Radio Workshop	The CBS Radio Workshop was an experimental dramatic radio anthology series that aired on CBS from January 27, 1956, until September 22, 1957. Subtitled “radio’s distinguished series to man’s imagination,” it was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radio's last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post-World War Two era.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Greenheinlein.jpg/175px-Greenheinlein.jpg
