63.7	Thrombosis	Thrombosis	Thrombosis (Greek: θρόμβωσις) is the formation of a blood clot and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss. Alternatively, even when a blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body if the proper conditions present themselves. If the clotting is too severe and the clot breaks free, the traveling clot is now known as an embolus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Aterialthrombosis.jpg/230px-Aterialthrombosis.jpg
