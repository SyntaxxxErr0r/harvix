62.4	Greeting_card	Greeting card	A greeting card is an illustrated, folded card featuring an expression of friendship or other sentiment. Although greeting cards are usually given on special occasions such as birthdays, Christmas or other holidays, they are also sent to convey thanks or express other feeling. Greeting cards, usually packaged with an envelope, come in a variety of styles. There are both mass-produced as well as handmade versions that are distributed by hundreds of companies large and small. While typically inexpensive, more elaborate cards with die-cuts or glued-on decorations may be more expensive.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Greetingcardsretaildisplay.jpg/275px-Greetingcardsretaildisplay.jpg
