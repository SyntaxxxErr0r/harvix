2.30	Artificial_lawn	Artificial turf	Artificial turf is a surface manufactured from synthetic fibers made to look like natural grass. It is most often used in arenas for sports that were originally or are normally played on grass. However, it is now being used on residential lawns and commercial applications as well. The main reason is maintenanceâ€”artificial turf resists heavy use, such as in sports, and requires no irrigation or trimming. Domed, covered, and partially covered stadiums may require artificial turf because of the difficulty of getting grass enough sunlight to stay healthy. But artificial turf does have its downside: limited life, periodic cleaning requirements, petroleum use, toxic chemicals from infill and some heightened health and safety concerns with children.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Kunstgress.JPG/300px-Kunstgress.JPG
