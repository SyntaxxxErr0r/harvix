84.4	Tessellation	Tessellation	Tessellation is the process of creating a two-dimensional plane using the repetition of a geometric shape with no overlaps and no gaps. Generalizations to higher dimensions are also possible. Tessellations frequently appeared in the art of M. C. Escher, who was inspired by studying the Moorish use of symmetry in the Alhambra tiles during a visit in 1922. Tessellations are seen throughout art history, from ancient architecture to modern art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Wallpaper_group-p3-1.jpg/300px-Wallpaper_group-p3-1.jpg
