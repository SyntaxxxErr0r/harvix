88.2	Bitwise_operation	Bitwise operation	A bitwise operation operates on one or more bit patterns or binary numerals at the level of their individual bits. It is a fast, primitive action directly supported by the processor, and is used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations. On simple low-cost processors, typically, bitwise operations are substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition. While modern high-performance processors usually perform addition and multiplication as fast as bitwise operations, the latter may still be optimal for overall power/performance due to lower resource use.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Rotate_left_logically.svg/150px-Rotate_left_logically.svg.png
