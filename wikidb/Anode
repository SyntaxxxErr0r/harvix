65.1	Anode	Anode	An anode is an electrode through which electric current flows into a polarized electrical device. The direction of electric current is, by convention, opposite to the direction of electron flow. In other words, the electrons flow from the anode into, for example, an electrical circuit. Mnemonic: ACID (Anode Current Into Device).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Zinc_anode_2.svg/220px-Zinc_anode_2.svg.png
