2.00	Seven_Ecumenical_Councils	First seven Ecumenical Councils	In the history of Christianity, the first seven Ecumenical Councils, from the First Council of Nicaea (325) to the Second Council of Nicaea (787), represent an attempt to reach an orthodox consensus and to establish a unified Christendom as the State church of the Roman Empire. The East-West Schism, formally dated to 1054, was still almost three centuries off from the last of these councils. Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Anglican churches all claim to trace their clergy by apostolic succession back to this period and the earlier period referred to as Early Christianity. However, breaks of unity that still persist today had occurred even during this period. The Assyrian Church of the East accepted the first two, but rejected the third, the First Council of Ephesus (431). The Quinisext Council (692), which attempted to establish the Pentarchy and which is not generally considered one of the first seven ecumenical councils, is not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church, which also considers that there have been many more ecumenical councils after the first seven, see Roman Catholic Ecumenical councils 8-21.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg/220px-Nicaea_icon.jpg
