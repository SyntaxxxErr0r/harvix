80.2	Monoculture	Monoculture	Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop or plant species over a wide area and for a large number of consecutive years. It is widely used in modern industrial agriculture and its implementation has allowed for large harvests from minimal labor. However, this ratio remains true only if the accounting for labor required is limited to the number of workers employed on the farm. If the indirect work of employees involved in producing chemicals and machinery are taken into account, the ratio of labor to output is higher.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Tractors_in_Potato_Field.jpg/220px-Tractors_in_Potato_Field.jpg
