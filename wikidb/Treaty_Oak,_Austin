Forestry experts estimate the Treaty Oak to be about 500 years old and, before its vandalism in 1989, the tree's branches had a spread of 127 feet. The tree is located in Treaty Oak Park, on Baylor Street between 5th and 6th Streets, in the West Line Historic District.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/TreatyOak.jpeg/250px-TreatyOak.jpeg
