92.9	Tuque	Tuque	A tuque , knit cap (American English), or beanie (UK English), also variously known as a knit hat, toboggan, burglar beanie or stocking cap among other names â€“ is a knitted cap, originally of wool though now often of synthetic fibers, that is designed to provide warmth in winter. Most tuques are tapered; they sometimes have ear flaps, and may be topped with a pom-pom (this style of tuque is sometimes referred to as a bobble hat, boggan or sherpa). Tuques may have a folded brim, or none, and may be worn tightly fitting the head or loose on top although the latter is considered more standard.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Beanie.svg/180px-Beanie.svg.png
