84.5	Orthodox_Judaism	Orthodox Judaism	Orthodox Judaism is the approach to Judaism which adheres to the traditional interpretation and application of the laws and ethics of the Torah as legislated in the Talmudic texts by the Sanhedrin ("Oral Torah") and subsequently developed and applied by the later authorities known as the Gaonim, Rishonim, and Acharonim. Orthodox Jews are also called "observant Jews"; Orthodoxy is known also as "Torah Judaism" or "traditional Judaism". Orthodox Judaism generally refers to Modern Orthodox Judaism and Haredi Judaism but can actually include a wide range of beliefs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Reb_Moshe_Feinstein.jpg/250px-Reb_Moshe_Feinstein.jpg
