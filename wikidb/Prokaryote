97.5	Prokaryote	Prokaryote	The prokaryotes ( or ) are a group of organisms that lack a cell nucleus (= karyon), or any other membrane-bound organelles. The organisms that have a cell nucleus are called eukaryotes. Most prokaryotes are unicellular, but a few such as myxobacteria have multicellular stages in their life cycles. The word prokaryote comes from the Greek πρό- (pro-) "before" + καρυόν (karyon) "nut or kernel". Prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, mitochondria, or any other membrane-bound organelles. In other words, neither their DNA nor any of their other sites of metabolic activity are collected together in a discrete membrane-enclosed area. Instead, everything is openly accessible within the cell, some of which is free-floating.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Average_prokaryote_cell-_en.svg/300px-Average_prokaryote_cell-_en.svg.png
