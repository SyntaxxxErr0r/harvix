54.9	Japan_(band)	Japan (band)	Japan were a British New Wave group that formed in 1974 in Catford, South London. The band achieved success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when it was often associated with the burgeoning New Romantic fashion movement (though the band itself has downplayed any such connection). They achieved several UK hits in the early 1980s, most notably "Ghosts" and "I Second That Emotion", which were top ten hits in 1982.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Japan_Nov82-curtain.JPG/220px-Japan_Nov82-curtain.JPG
