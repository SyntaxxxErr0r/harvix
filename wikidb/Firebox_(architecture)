4.00	Firebox_(architecture)	Firebox (architecture)	A firebox or firepit is the part of the fireplace where fuel is combusted, in distinction to the hearth, chimney, mantel, overdoor and flue elements of the total fireplace system. The firebox normally sits on a masonry base at the floor level of the room. Some fireboxes are large in proportion so that a person could actually walk inside, or in extreme cases have a small meeting using built-in benches inside. An example of the latter oversize construction can be found in the great hall of Muchalls Castle in Scotland.
