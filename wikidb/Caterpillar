59.9	Caterpillar	Caterpillar	Caterpillars are the larval form of members of the order Lepidoptera (the insect order comprising butterflies and moths). They are mostly herbivorous in food habit, although some species are insectivorous. Caterpillars are voracious feeders and many of them are considered to be pests in agriculture. Many moth species are better known in their caterpillar stages because of the damage they cause to fruits and other agricultural produce.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Geometridae.jpg/220px-Geometridae.jpg
