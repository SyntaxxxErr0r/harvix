57.1	Parachute	Parachute	A parachute is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag, or in the case of ram-air parachutes, aerodynamic lift. Parachutes are usually made out of light, strong cloth, originally silk, now most commonly nylon. Parachutes must slow an object's terminal vertical speed by a minimum 75% in order to be classified as such. Depending on the situation, parachutes are used with a variety of loads, including people, food, equipment, space capsules, and bombs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/US_Army_paratroopers_Fort_Bragg.jpg/170px-US_Army_paratroopers_Fort_Bragg.jpg
