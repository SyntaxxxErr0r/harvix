6.03	Skip_(curling)	Skip (curling)	In curling, the skip is the captain of the team. The skip is responsible for determining strategy, and holds the broom in the house to indicate where a teammate at the other end of the curling sheet should aim the stone. The skip usually throws the last two stones in the fourth position, but the skip can play in any other position.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Curling_at_Olympics_2010%2C_Women%2C_1_session.jpg/220px-Curling_at_Olympics_2010%2C_Women%2C_1_session.jpg
