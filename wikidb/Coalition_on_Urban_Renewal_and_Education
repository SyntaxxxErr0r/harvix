The Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education "works with black religious and community groups on social policy issues like school choice" and organizes meetings and discussions. The group's mission is to "jump start national dialogue on issues of race and poverty," according to its web site. The organization focuses on personal freedom and personal responsibility as solutions to poverty, rather than welfare dependence. It functions as a social policy think tank that examines issues of race and poverty and proposes alternatives to the welfare state that are faith based and market based.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Coalition_on_Urban_Renewal_and_Education_logo.jpg/250px-Coalition_on_Urban_Renewal_and_Education_logo.jpg
