7.20	French_navy	French Navy	The French Navy, officially the Marine nationale ("National Navy") and often called La Royale, is the maritime arm of the French military. Tracing its roots back from 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Today it remains one of only three blue-water navies world wide (the other two being the United States Navy and Royal Navy) and its roles include the protection of French interests abroad, and the maintenance of global stability.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Logo_of_the_French_Navy_%28Marine_Nationale%29.svg/160px-Logo_of_the_French_Navy_%28Marine_Nationale%29.svg.png
