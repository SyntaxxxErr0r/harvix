103.6	Serial_killer	Serial killer	A serial killer is typically defined as an individual who has killed 3 or more people over a period of more than a month, with down time (a "cooling off period") between the murders, and whose motivation for killing is usually based on psychological gratification. Some sources disregard the "three or more" criteria, and define the term as "a series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone" or, including the vital characteristics, a minimum of at least two murders. Often, a sexual element is involved in the killings, but the FBI states that motives for serial murder include "anger, thrill, financial gain, and attention seeking". The murders may have been attempted or completed in a similar fashion and the victims may have had something in common, for example, occupation, race, appearance, sex, or age group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Francisco_de_Assis_Pereira.jpg/160px-Francisco_de_Assis_Pereira.jpg
