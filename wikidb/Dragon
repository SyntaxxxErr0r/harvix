81.6	Dragon	Dragon	A dragon is a legendary creature, typically with serpentine or reptilian traits, that feature in the myths of many cultures. There are two distinct cultural traditions of dragons: the European dragon, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies, and the Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan, Korea and other East Asian countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Ljubljana_dragon.JPG/220px-Ljubljana_dragon.JPG
