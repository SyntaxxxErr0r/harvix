2.40	Homosexuality_in_the_New_Testament	Homosexuality in the New Testament	In the New Testament (NT) there are three short passages that refer specifically to what today would be called homosexual activity. These passages appear in the Pauline epistles Romans 1:26–27, 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, and 1 Timothy 1:9–10. None of the four gospels mentions the subject from which it can be inferred that homosexuality was not a matter of major concern either for Jesus or for the early Christian movement. Moreover, there is nothing about homosexuality in the Book of Acts, in Hebrews, in Revelation, or in the letters attributed to James, Peter, John, and Jude.
