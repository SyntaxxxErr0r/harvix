6.13	Iterative_deepening	Iterative deepening depth-first search	Iterative deepening depth-first search (IDDFS) is a state space search strategy in which a depth-limited search is run repeatedly, increasing the depth limit with each iteration until it reaches , the depth of the shallowest goal state. IDDFS is equivalent to breadth-first search, but uses much less memory; on each iteration, it visits the nodes in the search tree in the same order as depth-first search, but the cumulative order in which nodes are first visited is effectively breadth-first.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Graph.traversal.example.svg/200px-Graph.traversal.example.svg.png
