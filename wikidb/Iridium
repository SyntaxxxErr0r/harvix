71.5	Iridium	Iridium	Iridium ( -ee-əm) is the chemical element with atomic number 77, and is represented by the symbol Ir. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum family, iridium is the second-densest element (after osmium) and is the most corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000 °C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Iridium-2.jpg/250px-Iridium-2.jpg
