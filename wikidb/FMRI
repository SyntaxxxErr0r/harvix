51.1	FMRI	Functional magnetic resonance imaging	Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI is an MRI procedure that measures brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow. The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Seiji Ogawa. This is a type of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or animals by imaging the change in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to energy use by brain cells. Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo shots, surgery, or to ingest substances, or be exposed to radiation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Researcher-test.jpg/300px-Researcher-test.jpg
