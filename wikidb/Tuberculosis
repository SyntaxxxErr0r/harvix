195.4	Tuberculosis	Tuberculosis	Tuberculosis, MTB, or TB (short for tubercle bacillus) is a common, and in many cases lethal, infectious disease caused by various strains of mycobacteria, usually Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis usually attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. It is spread through the air when people who have an active MTB infection cough, sneeze, or otherwise transmit their saliva through the air. Most infections in humans result in an asymptomatic, latent infection, and about one in ten latent infections eventually progress to active disease, which, if left untreated, kills more than 50% of those infected.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Tuberculosis-x-ray-1.jpg/230px-Tuberculosis-x-ray-1.jpg
