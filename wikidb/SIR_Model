4.20	SIR_Model	Compartmental models in epidemiology	In order to model the progress of an epidemic in a large population, comprising many different individuals in various fields, the population diversity must be reduced to a few key characteristics which are relevant to the infection under consideration. For example, for most common childhood diseases that confer long-lasting immunity it makes sense to divide the population into those who are susceptible to the disease, those who are infected and those who have recovered and are immune. These subdivisions of the population are called compartments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Sirsys-p9.png/220px-Sirsys-p9.png
