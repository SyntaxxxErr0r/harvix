7.21	Phase_cancellation	Interference (wave propagation)	In physics, interference is a phenomenon in which two waves superimpose to form a resultant wave of greater or lower amplitude. Interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency. Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves, for example, light, radio, acoustic, and surface water waves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Two-point-interference-ripple-tank.JPG/170px-Two-point-interference-ripple-tank.JPG
