114.1	Technology_adoption_lifecycle	Technology adoption lifecycle	The technology adoption lifecycle model describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or "bell curve." The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "innovators," followed by "early adopters." Next come the early and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "laggards."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/DiffusionOfInnovation.png/220px-DiffusionOfInnovation.png
