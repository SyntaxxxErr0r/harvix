51.0	General_semantics	General semantics	General semantics is a program begun in the 1920s that seeks to regulate the evaluative operations performed in the human brain. After partial program launches under the trial names "human engineering" and "humanology," Polish-American originator Alfred Korzybski (1879â€“1950) fully launched the program as "general semantics" in 1933 with the publication of Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/G_semantics1946model.png/600px-G_semantics1946model.png
