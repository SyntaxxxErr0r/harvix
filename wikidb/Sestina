76.9	Sestina	Sestina	The sestina is composed of six stanzas of six lines (sixains), followed by a three-line envoy. There is no rhyme within the stanzas, nor do the lines follow any metrical pattern, although they are traditionally cast in iambs. The form of the sestina works by a recurrent pattern of the words that end each line, a technique known as "lexical repetition".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Sestina_system.svg/400px-Sestina_system.svg.png
