60.5	Hercules	Hercules	Hercules is the Roman name for Greek demigod Heracles, son of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter) and the mortal Alcmene. Early Roman sources suggest that the imported Greek hero supplanted a mythic Italic shepherd called "Recaranus" or "Garanus", famous for his strength who dedicated the Ara Maxima that became associated with the earliest Roman cult of Hercules. While adopting much of the Greek Heracles' iconography and mythology as his own, Hercules adopted a number of myths and characteristics that were distinctly Roman. With the spread of Roman hegemony, Hercules was worshipped locally from Hispania through Gaul.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Heracles_Pio-Clementino_Inv252.jpg/220px-Heracles_Pio-Clementino_Inv252.jpg
