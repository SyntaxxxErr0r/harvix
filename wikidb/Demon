89.7	Demon	Demon	A demon (or daemon, from Ancient Greek, δαίμων daímōn), is a supernatural being from various religions, occultisms, literatures, and folklores that is described as something that is not human and, in ordinary (almost universal) usage, malevolent. The original neutral Greek word "daimon" does not carry the negative connotation initially understood by implementation of the Koine , and later ascribed to any cognate words sharing the root, originally intended to denote a spirit or spiritual being.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Schongauer_Anthony.jpg/250px-Schongauer_Anthony.jpg
