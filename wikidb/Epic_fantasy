8.11	Epic_fantasy	High fantasy	High fantasy or epic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy that is set in invented or parallel worlds. High fantasy was brought to fruition through the work of authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, whose major fantasy works were published in the 1950s. High fantasy has become one of the two genres most commonly associated with the general term fantasy, the other being sword and sorcery, which is typified by the works of Robert E. Howard.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Sigurd_kills_Fafnir_by_Rackham.jpg/220px-Sigurd_kills_Fafnir_by_Rackham.jpg
