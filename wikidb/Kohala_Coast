1.20	Kohala_Coast	Kohala, Hawaii	Kohala is the name of the northwest portion of the island of Hawaii in the Hawaiian Archipelago. In ancient Hawaii it was often ruled by an independent High Chief called the Alii Nui. In modern times it is divided into two districts of Hawaii County: North Kohala and South Kohala. Locals commonly use the name singularly when referring to the area surrounding the towns of Hāwī and Kapaau. The dry western shore is commonly known as the Kohala Coast, which has golf courses and seaside resorts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/HawaiiIslandDistrict-Kohala.png/300px-HawaiiIslandDistrict-Kohala.png
