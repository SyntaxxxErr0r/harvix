1.00	Green_bombers	National Youth Service (Zimbabwe)	The National Youth Service is a programme of the Zimbabwean government for Zimbabweans of ages 10 to 30. It was authorized in 1999 and established in 2001 under the presidency of Robert Mugabe. Its stated purpose is to "transform and empower youths for nation building through life skills training and leadership development." The National Youth Service has been condemned in the West and in Africa for gross human rights violations on behalf of the ZANU-PF party. Within Zimbabwe the graduates of the service are known pejoratively as green bombers after the fatigue uniforms they wear and more recently as the Youth Brigade.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/77/ThirdChimurenga.png/220px-ThirdChimurenga.png
