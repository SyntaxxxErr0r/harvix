54.4	Bird_migration	Bird migration	Bird migration is the regular seasonal journey undertaken by many species of birds. Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability, habitat or weather. Sometimes, journeys are not termed "true migration" because they are irregular (nomadism, invasions, irruptions) or in only one direction (dispersal, movement of young away from natal area). Migration is marked by its annual seasonality.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/BrantaLeucopsisMigration.jpg/300px-BrantaLeucopsisMigration.jpg
