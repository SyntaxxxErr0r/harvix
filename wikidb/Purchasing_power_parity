205.8	Purchasing_power_parity	Purchasing power parity	In economics, purchasing power parity asks how much money would be needed to purchase the same goods and services in two countries, and uses that to calculate an implicit foreign exchange rate. Using that PPP rate, an amount of money thus has the same purchasing power in different countries. Among other uses, PPP rates facilitate international comparisons of income, as market exchange rates are often volatile, are affected by political and financial factors that do not lead to immediate changes in income and tend to systematically understate the standard of living in poor countries, due to the Balassaâ€“Samuelson effect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/GDP_PPP_per_capita_2009_IMF.png/400px-GDP_PPP_per_capita_2009_IMF.png
