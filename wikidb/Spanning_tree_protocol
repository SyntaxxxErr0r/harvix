51.7	Spanning_tree_protocol	Spanning Tree Protocol	The Spanning Tree Protocol is a network protocol that ensures a loop-free topology for any bridged Ethernet local area network. The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. Spanning tree also allows a network design to include spare (redundant) links to provide automatic backup paths if an active link fails, without the danger of bridge loops, or the need for manual enabling/disabling of these backup links.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Spanning_tree_protocol_at_work_1.svg/300px-Spanning_tree_protocol_at_work_1.svg.png
