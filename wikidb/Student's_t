2.00	Student's_t	Student's t-distribution	In probability and statistics, Student’s t-distribution (or simply the t-distribution) is a family of continuous probability distributions that arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and population standard deviation is unknown. It plays a role in a number of widely-used statistical analyses, including the Student’s t-test for assessing the statistical significance of the difference between two sample means, the construction of confidence intervals for the difference between two population means, and in linear regression analysis. The Student’s t-distribution also arises in the Bayesian analysis of data from a normal family.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Student_t_pdf.svg/325px-Student_t_pdf.svg.png
