1.00	Navy_Register	Naval Vessel Register	The Naval Vessel Register is the official inventory of ships and service craft in custody of or titled by the United States Navy. It contains information on ships and service craft that make up the official inventory of the Navy from the time a vessel is authorized through its life cycle and disposal. It also includes ships that have been removed from the register (often termed stricken or struck), but not disposed of by sale, transfer to another government, or other means. Ships and service craft disposed of prior to 1987 are currently not included, but are gradually being added along with other updates.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/NavalVesselRegister.gif/300px-NavalVesselRegister.gif
