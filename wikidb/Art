219.9	Art	Art	Art is a term that describes a diverse range of human activities and the products of those activities, but is most often understood to refer to painting, film, photography, sculpture, and other visual media. Music, theatre, dance, literature, and interactive media are included in a broader definition of art or the arts. Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences, but in modern usage the fine arts are distinguished from acquired skills in general.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Art-portrait-collage_2.jpg/300px-Art-portrait-collage_2.jpg
