56.3	Annual_plant	Annual plant	An annual plant is a plant that usually germinates, flowers, and dies in a year or season. True annuals will only live longer than a year if they are prevented from setting seed. Some seedless plants can also be considered annuals even though they do not grow a flower.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Doperwt_rijserwt_peulen_Pisum_sativum.jpg/240px-Doperwt_rijserwt_peulen_Pisum_sativum.jpg
