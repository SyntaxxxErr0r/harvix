Although he considered himself to be a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, by the end of his life it was Ingres's portraits, both painted and drawn, that were recognized as his greatest legacy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Ingres%2C_Self-portrait.jpg/250px-Ingres%2C_Self-portrait.jpg
