3.00	IEC_fusion	Inertial electrostatic confinement	The best-known IEC device is the Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor. This system consists largely of two concentric spherical electrical grids inside a vacuum chamber into which a small amount of fusion fuel is introduced. Voltage across the grids causes the fuel to ionize around them, and positively charged ions are accelerated towards the center of the chamber. Those ions may collide and fuse with ions coming from the other direction, may scatter without fusing, or may pass directly through. In the latter two cases, the ions will tend to be stopped by the electric field and re-accelerated toward the center. Fusors can also use ion guns rather than electric grids.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/US3530497_-_Hirsch-Meek_fusor.png/222px-US3530497_-_Hirsch-Meek_fusor.png
