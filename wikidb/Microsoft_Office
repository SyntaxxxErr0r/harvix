139.6	Microsoft_Office	Microsoft Office	Microsoft Office is a proprietary commercial office suite of inter-related desktop applications, servers and services for the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X operating systems, introduced by Microsoft on August 1, 1989. Initially a marketing term for a bundled set of applications, the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Microsoft_Office_2010_Logo.svg/250px-Microsoft_Office_2010_Logo.svg.png
