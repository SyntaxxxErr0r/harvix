1.11	Lam_Van_Phat	Lam Van Phat	Major General Lâm Văn Phát (born c. 1927, Cần Thơ – died 1998) served as an officer in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). He is best-known for leading two coup attempts against General Nguyễn Khánh in September 1964 and February 1965. Although both failed to result in his taking power, the latter caused enough instability that it forced Khánh to resign and go into exile.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Ngo_Dinh_Diem_-_Thumbnail_-_ARC_542189.gif
