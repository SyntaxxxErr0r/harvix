73.5	Palestinian_people	Palestinian people	The Palestinian people, also referred to as Palestinians (Arabic: ‎, al-Filasṭīniyyūn), are a people descending from the peoples who have lived in Palestine over the centuries. Today, Palestinians are largely culturally and linguistically Arab. Despite various wars and exoduses, roughly one half of the world's Palestinian population continues to reside in the area encompassing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Israel. In this combined area, as of 2004, Palestinians constituted 49% of all inhabitants, encompassing the entire population of the Gaza Strip (1.6 million), the majority of the population of the West Bank (approximately 2.3 million versus close to 500,000 Jewish Israeli citizens which includes about 200,000 in East Jerusalem), and 16.5% of the population of Israel proper as Arab citizens of Israel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Palestinian_infobox_alternate.jpg/275px-Palestinian_infobox_alternate.jpg
