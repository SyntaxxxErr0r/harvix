57.6	Saipan	Saipan	Saipan ( ) is the largest island of the United States Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), a chain of 15 tropical islands belonging to the Marianas archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean (15°10’51”N, 145°45’21”E) with a total area of 44.55 sq mi (115.4 km2). According to the 2010 United States Census, Saipan's population was 48,220, a drop of 22.7% from the 2000 US Census; the population decrease is largely attributed to working immigrants and their families either returning to their home countries after the collapse of the garment industry or moving to other locations with economic opportunities such as Guam and the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Mariana_Islands_-_Saipan.PNG/220px-Mariana_Islands_-_Saipan.PNG
