140.1	Electric_power_transmission	Electric power transmission	Electric-power transmission is the bulk transfer of electrical energy, from generating power plants to electrical substations located near demand centers. This is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution. Transmission lines, when interconnected with each other, become transmission networks. In the US, these are typically referred to as "power grids" or just "the grid", while in the UK the network is known as the "national grid." North America has three major grids: the Western Interconnection; the Eastern Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (or ERCOT) grid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Delta_pylon_near_Madrid.jpg/220px-Delta_pylon_near_Madrid.jpg
