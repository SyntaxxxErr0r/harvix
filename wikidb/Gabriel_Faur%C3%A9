55.7	Gabriel_Faur%C3%A9	Gabriel Fauré	Gabriel Urbain Fauré was a French composer, organist, pianist and teacher. He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his Pavane, Requiem, nocturnes for piano, and the songs "Après un rêve" and "Clair de lune". Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Fauré composed many of his greatest works in his later years, in a harmonically and melodically much more complex style.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/John_Singer_Sargent_-_Gabriel_Faur%C3%A9.jpg/220px-John_Singer_Sargent_-_Gabriel_Faur%C3%A9.jpg
