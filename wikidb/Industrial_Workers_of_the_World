124.5	Industrial_Workers_of_the_World	Industrial Workers of the World	The Industrial Workers of the World is an international union. At its peak in 1923, the organization claimed some 100,000 members in good standing and could marshal the support of perhaps 300,000 workers. Its membership declined dramatically after a 1924 split brought on by internal conflict. IWW membership does not require that one work in a represented workplace, nor does it exclude membership in another labor union.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Label.svg/200px-Label.svg.png
