57.2	Invader_Zim	Invader Zim	Invader Zim is an American animated television series created by Jhonen Vasquez. It was produced by and subsequently aired on Nickelodeon. The series revolves around an extraterrestrial named Zim from the planet Irk, and his ongoing mission to conquer and destroy Earth. His various attempts to subjugate and destroy the human race are invariably undermined by some combination of his own ineptitude, his malfunctioning robot servant GIR, and his arch-nemesis Dib, one of very few humans attentive enough to be aware of Zim's identity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Invader_Zim_title_card.png/250px-Invader_Zim_title_card.png
