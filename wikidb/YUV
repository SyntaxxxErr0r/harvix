63.4	YUV	YUV	YUV is a color space typically used as part of a color image pipeline. It encodes a color image or video taking human perception into account, allowing reduced bandwidth for chrominance components, thereby typically enabling transmission errors or compression artifacts to be more efficiently masked by the human perception than using a "direct" RGB-representation. Other color spaces have similar properties, and the main reason to implement or investigate properties of Y'UV would be for interfacing with analog or digital television or photographic equipment that conforms to certain Y'UV standards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/YUV_UV_plane.svg/300px-YUV_UV_plane.svg.png
