Blocked from its normal movement, polar air from the north pushed into nearly every section of the eastern half of the United States and Canada, shattering record lows in a number of areas. Note the event was preceded by unusually warm weather in the eastern U.S. in December 1984, suggesting that there was a build-up of cold air that was suddenly released from the Arctic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/January_21%2C_1985_temperature_map.jpg/350px-January_21%2C_1985_temperature_map.jpg
