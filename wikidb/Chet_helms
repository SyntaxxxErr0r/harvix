1.00	Chet_helms	Chet Helms	On July 24th, 2005 a fundraiser and Tribute concert to Chet was held at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. The show was organized by Dawn Holliday (Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival organizer), Roger McNamee (who put together a collection of posters from major bay area artists) and Pete Sears who was responsible for finding and organizing the musicians. Kathy Peck of the H.E.A.R. foundation organized the online auction. Pete Sears had been talking with Chet while he was sick in hospital and offered to help get a benefit together to take care of some pressing bills Chet was concerned about. Chet wholeheartedly gave the benefit his blessing. The concert details were well underway and most artists in place when Chet tragically passed away. They decided to carry on with the fundraiser anyway and turned the concert into a tribute to Chet. The show sold out in just a few days, unfortunately leaving many lined up outside unable to get in. But the concert obtained its primary goal which was to raise funds to pay off Chet’s bills…all money raised was given to Chet’s brother John. The concert was highly successful and featured such artists as: T Bone Burnett, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, David Nelson, Country Joe McDonald, Leigh Stephens, Bobby Vega, Joli Valenti &amp; Friends, and the Flying Other Brothers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/19/Chet.Helms.Memorial.Tribal.Stomp.October.2006.Golden.Gate.Park.San.Francisco.jpg
