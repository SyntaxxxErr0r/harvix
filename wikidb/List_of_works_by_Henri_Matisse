3.10	List_of_works_by_Henri_Matisse	List of works by Henri Matisse	This is an incomplete list of works by the French modern artist Henri Matisse (31 December 1869 â€“ 3 November 1954). He is admired for his use of color and his fluid, brilliant and original draughtsmanship. He was a Master draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but is known primarily as a painter. Matisse is regarded, with Pablo Picasso, as the greatest artist of the 20th century. Although he was initially labeled as a Fauve (wild beast), by the 1920s, he was increasingly hailed as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Henri_Matisse_Self-Portrait_in_a_Striped_T-shirt_%281906%29.jpg/220px-Henri_Matisse_Self-Portrait_in_a_Striped_T-shirt_%281906%29.jpg
