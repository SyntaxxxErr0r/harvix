102.7	Maginot_Line	Maginot Line	The Maginot Line , named after the French Minister of War Andr√© Maginot, was a line of concrete fortifications, tank obstacles, artillery casemates, machine gun posts, and other defences, which France constructed along its borders with Germany and Italy, in light of its experience in World War I, and in the run-up to World War II. Generally the term describes only the defences facing Germany, while the term Alpine Line is used for the Franco-Italian defences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Maginot_line_1.jpg/300px-Maginot_line_1.jpg
