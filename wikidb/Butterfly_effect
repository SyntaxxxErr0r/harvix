243.9	Butterfly_effect	Butterfly effect	In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, where a small change at one place in a nonlinear system can result in large differences to a later state. The name of the effect, coined by Edward Lorenz, is derived from the theoretical example of a hurricane's formation being contingent on whether or not a distant butterfly had flapped its wings several weeks before.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Sensitive-dependency.svg/300px-Sensitive-dependency.svg.png
