8.20	Herbert_Von_Karajan	Herbert von Karajan	Herbert von Karajan (German pronunciation: ; 5 April 1908 â€“ 16 July 1989) was an Austrian orchestra and opera conductor. To the wider world he was perhaps most famously associated with the Berlin Philharmonic, of which he was principal conductor for 35 years. Although his work was not universally admired, he is generally considered to have been one of the greatest conductors of all time, and he was a dominant figure in European classical music from the 1960s until his death. Part of the reason for this was the large number of recordings he made and their prominence during his lifetime. By one estimate he was the top-selling classical music recording artist of all time, having sold an estimated 200 million records.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-S47421%2C_Herbert_von_Karajan.jpg/240px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-S47421%2C_Herbert_von_Karajan.jpg
