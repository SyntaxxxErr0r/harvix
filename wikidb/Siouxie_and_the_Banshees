7.10	Siouxie_and_the_Banshees	Siouxsie and the Banshees	Siouxsie and the Banshees were a British rock band formed in 1976 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux and bassist Steven Severin. Initially associated with the English punk rock scene, the band rapidly evolved to create "a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation". The Times cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as "one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Siouxsie_and_the_Banshees-3.jpg/300px-Siouxsie_and_the_Banshees-3.jpg
