114.6	Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On	Keep Calm and Carry On	Keep Calm and Carry On was a public saftey poster produced by the British government in 1939 during the beginning of the Second World War, intended to raise the morale of the British public in the event of invasion. Seeing only limited distribution, it was little known. The poster was rediscovered in 2000 and has been re-issued by a number of private sector companies, and used as the decorative theme for a range of other products. There were only two known surviving examples of the poster outside government archives until a collection of about 20 originals was brought in to the Antiques Roadshow in 2012 by the daughter of an ex-Royal Observer Corps member.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Scan-of-original-poster-1939-300px.jpg/220px-Scan-of-original-poster-1939-300px.jpg
