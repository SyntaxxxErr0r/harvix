161.8	Classical_conditioning	Classical conditioning	Classical conditioning (also Pavlovian or respondent conditioning, Pavlovian reinforcement) is a form of conditioning and learning that was first demonstrated by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1927). In classical conditioning two stimuli are presented in close succession repeatedly, until the response given to one becomes associated with the other. In the most well known example Pavlov paired the neutral stimulus of a ringing bell with the positive unconditional stimulus of food repeatedly, until the ringing bell caused the dog to salivate. In this example the ringing bell had become a conditional stimulus once it took on the association with food.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/MonumentIPAVLOV.jpg/180px-MonumentIPAVLOV.jpg
