The nation returned to the Winter Games after having missed the 1932 Winter Olympics. These Games would be the last time that Latvia would compete at the Winter Games as an independent nation until the 1992 Winter Olympics. After the nation was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, Latvian athletes would compete at the Olympic Games as part of the USSR delegations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Flag_of_Latvia.svg/180px-Flag_of_Latvia.svg.png
