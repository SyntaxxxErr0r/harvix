77.4	Perennial_plant	Perennial plant	A perennial plant or simply perennial (Latin per, "through", annus, "year") is a plant that lives for more than two years. The term is often used to differentiate a plant from shorter lived annuals and biennials. The term is sometimes misused by commercial gardeners or horticulturalists to describe only herbaceous perennials. More correctly, woody plants like shrubs and trees are also perennials.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Cichorium_intybus-alvesgaspar1.jpg/220px-Cichorium_intybus-alvesgaspar1.jpg
