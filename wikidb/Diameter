57.1	Diameter	Diameter	In geometry, a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints are on the circle. The diameters are the longest chords of the circle. The word "diameter" derives from Greek διάμετρος , "diagonal of a circle", from δια- (dia-), "across, through" + μέτρον (metron), "a measure").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/CIRCLE_1.svg/220px-CIRCLE_1.svg.png
