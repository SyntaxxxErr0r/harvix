73.8	Hydrogen_bond	Hydrogen bond	A hydrogen bond is the attractive interaction of a hydrogen atom with an electronegative atom, such as nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine, that comes from another molecule or chemical group. The hydrogen must be covalently bonded to another electronegative atom to create the bond. These bonds can occur between molecules , or within different parts of a single molecule (intramolecularly). The hydrogen bond (5 to 30 kJ/mole) is stronger than a van der Waals interaction, but weaker than covalent or ionic bonds. This type of bond occurs in both inorganic molecules such as water and organic molecules like DNA.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Hydrogen_Bond_Quadruple_AngewChemIntEd_1998_v37_p75.jpg/300px-Hydrogen_Bond_Quadruple_AngewChemIntEd_1998_v37_p75.jpg
