18.42	Kala_Patthar	Kala Patthar	Kala Patthar, meaning 'black rock' in Nepali and Hindi, is a mountain in the Nepalese Himalayas. It appears as a big brown bump below the impressive south face of Pumori (7,161 m/23,494 ft). Many trekkers in the region of Mount Everest will attempt to summit Kala Patthar, since it provides the most accessible point to view Mt. Everest from base camp to peak (due to the structure of Everest, the peak cannot be seen from the base camp). The views of Everest, Lhotse, and Nuptse are spectacular from almost anywhere on Kala Patthar. The world's highest webcam, Mount Everest webcam, is located here.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Kalapathar.jpg/280px-Kalapathar.jpg
