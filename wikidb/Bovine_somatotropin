82.3	Bovine_somatotropin	Bovine somatotropin	Bovine somatotropin (abbreviated bST and BST), or BGH, is a peptide hormone produced by the cow's pituitary gland. Like other hormones, it is produced in small quantities and is used in regulating metabolic processes. Since 1994 it has been possible to synthesize the hormone using recombinant DNA technology to create recombinant bovine somatotropin , recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), or artificial growth hormone. Monsanto was the first to develop the technology and marketed it as "Posilac" - a brand now owned by Elanco Animal Health, a division of Eli Lilly and Company.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Holstein_dairy_cows.jpg/250px-Holstein_dairy_cows.jpg
