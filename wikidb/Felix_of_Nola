4.11	Felix_of_Nola	Felix of Nola	Saint Felix of Nola (d. ca. 250) was a Christian presbyter at Nola near Naples in Italy. He sold off his possessions in order to give to the poor, but was arrested and tortured for his Christian faith during the persecution of the Roman emperor Decius (r. 249-51). He was believed to have died a martyr's death during the persecution of Decius or Valentinian (ca. 253), but is now listed in the General Roman Calendar as a confessor of the faith, who survived his tortures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Felix_of_Nola-1.jpg/220px-Felix_of_Nola-1.jpg
