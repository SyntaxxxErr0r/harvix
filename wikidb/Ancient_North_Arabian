10.31	Ancient_North_Arabian	Ancient North Arabian	Ancient North Arabian is a language known from fragmentary inscriptions in modern day Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, dating to between roughly the 6th century BC and the 6th century AD, all written in scripts derived from Epigraphic South Arabian. Pre-classical Arabic (or Old Arabic), the predecessor of Classical Arabic, seems to have coexisted with these languages in central and north Arabia. However, it remained spoken until it was first attested in an inscription in Qaryat Al-Faw (Qaryat Dhat Kahil) in the 1st century BC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/WadiRumPetroglyphs.jpg/250px-WadiRumPetroglyphs.jpg
