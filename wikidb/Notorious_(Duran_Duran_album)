3.10	Notorious_(Duran_Duran_album)	Notorious (Duran Duran album)	Notorious is the fourth studio album by Duran Duran. Released in November 1986, it peaked at #16 in the UK and #12 in the US. The singles "Notorious" and "Skin Trade" demonstrated a Duran Duran reaching for funk, heavy on bass and brass. The gap between previous efforts and the new one, however (one year removed from "A View to a Kill" and the Arcadia/Power Station projects, two years from Arena, three from Seven and the Ragged Tiger), was hard to handle for the greater part of the fan base, since the album signaled a stylistic departure from the successful dance-pop of their earlier days. Many fans felt that the album seemed to lack the sparkle of the band's initial peak era (1981 to 1985).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Duran_Duran_Notorious.jpg/220px-Duran_Duran_Notorious.jpg
