80.2	OpenVMS	OpenVMS	OpenVMS , previously known as VAX-11/VMS, VAX/VMS or (informally) VMS, is a computer server operating system that runs on VAX, Alpha and Itanium-based families of computers. Contrary to what its name suggests, OpenVMS is not open source software; however, the source listings are available for purchase. Unlike some other mainframe-oriented operating systems, OpenVMS has a graphical user interface (GUI) with complete graphics support. Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX was one of the three top-selling workstations lines in the 1980s and 1990s. VMS had support for professional DTP and CAE software. Software for AXP based systems was promoted by Digital's ASAP program (Association of Software and Application Partners) and could be found in the extensive "Alpha Applications Catalog". AXP VMS supported OpenGL and Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) graphics adapters.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/OpenVMS_logo_Swoosh_30_lg.jpg/150px-OpenVMS_logo_Swoosh_30_lg.jpg
