70.4	Herb_Caen	Herb Caen	Herbert Eugene Caen (April 3, 1916 â€“ February 1, 1997) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning San Francisco journalist whose daily column of local goings-on, social and political happenings, local anecdotes, and insider gossip -- often poking fun, but rarely if ever hostile or ill-willed -- appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle for almost sixty years, except during a relatively short stint at the San Francisco Examiner. His name was a household word throughout the San Francisco Bay Area for decades; his funeral was one of the best-attended in San Francisco history, and republications of his old columns remain a prominent Chronicle feature many years after his death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Loyal_royal.jpg/220px-Loyal_royal.jpg
