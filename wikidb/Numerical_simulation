2.31	Numerical_simulation	Computer simulation	A computer simulation, a computer model, or a computational model is a computer program, or network of computers, that attempts to simulate an abstract model of a particular system. Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics , astrophysics, chemistry and biology, human systems in economics, psychology, social science, and engineering. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology, and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Typhoon_Mawar_2005_computer_simulation_thumbnail.gif/400px-Typhoon_Mawar_2005_computer_simulation_thumbnail.gif
