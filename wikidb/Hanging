69.4	Hanging	Hanging	Hanging is the lethal suspension of a person by a ligature. The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is "specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain "hanging".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Pisanello_010.jpg/220px-Pisanello_010.jpg
