1.10	Choti_Si_Baat	Chhoti Si Baat	Chhoti Si Baat (Devnagari: छोटी सी बात) is a 1975 Hindi romantic comedy film directed by Basu Chatterjee. The film's title means "Such a Small Thing" in Hindi. Considered one of the best Hindi comedy films of the 1970s, it is a nostalgic favourite for its quirky take on pre-hypercongestion Bombay. The film established Amol Palekar as having an uncommon comic talent for playing mousy characters, a role he would go on to repeat several times in his career. This movie is based on "School for Scoundrels", a 1960 British Comedy which itself inspired from the "Gamesmanship" series of books by Stephen Potter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Chhoti_Si_Baat.jpg/220px-Chhoti_Si_Baat.jpg
