69.4	Lhasa_Apso	Lhasa Apso	The Lhasa Apso ( -sə -soh) is a non-sporting dog breed originating in Tibet. It was bred as an interior sentinel in the Buddhist monasteries, who alerted the monks to any intruders who entered. Lhasa is the capital city of Tibet and apso is a word in the Tibetan language meaning "Bearded," so Lhasa Apso (ཁྱི་ཨབ་སོག་) simply means "Long-haired Tibetan dog."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Aishia.jpg/220px-Aishia.jpg
