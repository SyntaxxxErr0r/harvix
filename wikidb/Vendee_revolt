1.00	Vendee_revolt	War in the Vendée	The War in the Vendée (1793 to 1796; French: ) was a Royalist rebellion and counterrevolution in the Vendée region of France during the French Revolution. The Vendée is a coastal region, located immediately south of the Loire River in western France. The uprising was closely tied to the Chouannerie, which took place in the area north of the Loire. Initially, the war was similar to the earlier Jacquerie peasant uprising, but quickly took on counterrevolutionary themes. The nature of the uprising has been disputed by members of the right-wing movement in France since the nineteenth century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/GuerreVend%C3%A9e_1.jpg/300px-GuerreVend%C3%A9e_1.jpg
