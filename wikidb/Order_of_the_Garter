56.0	Order_of_the_Garter	Order of the Garter	The Most Noble Order of the Garter, founded in 1348, is the highest order of chivalry, or knighthood, existing in England. The order is dedicated to the image and arms of St. George as England's patron saint, and is presently bestowed on recipients from British and other Commonwealth realms; after peerages (and after the Victoria Cross and George Cross), it is the pinnacle of the honours system in the United Kingdom. Membership in the order is limited to the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and no more than twenty-four members, or Companions; the order also comprises Supernumerary knights and ladies (e.g., members of the British Royal Family and foreign monarchs). Bestowing the honour has been described as one of the Monarch's few remaining truly personal, executive prerogatives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Arms_of_the_Most_Noble_Order_of_the_Garter.svg/250px-Arms_of_the_Most_Noble_Order_of_the_Garter.svg.png
