61.0	Aubrey_Beardsley	Aubrey Beardsley	Aubrey Vincent Beardsley (21 August 1872 â€“ 16 March 1898) was an English illustrator and author. His drawings, done in black ink and influenced by the style of Japanese woodcuts, emphasized the grotesque, the decadent, and the erotic. He was a leading figure in the Aesthetic movement which also included Oscar Wilde and James A. McNeill Whistler. Beardsley's contribution to the development of the Art Nouveau and poster styles was significant, despite the brevity of his career before his early death from tuberculosis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/AubreyBeardsley-Hollyer1.jpg/220px-AubreyBeardsley-Hollyer1.jpg
