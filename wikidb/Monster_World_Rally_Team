The team was formed by Block at the beginning of 2010 as a platform for him to compete at world championship level. The team, sponsored by Monster Energy, currently runs one 2011 Ford Fiesta RS WRC for Block and co-driver Alex Gelsomino, and planned to expand to two cars for 2011. The car is built and run by M-Sport, a British motorsport team, who also run the cars for the Ford World Rally Team. Block and the team are also competing in Rally America in a open class Ford Fiesta.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/MonsterWRTlogo.png/180px-MonsterWRTlogo.png
