7.71	Bragg_diffraction	Bragg's law	W. L. Bragg explained this result by modeling the crystal as a set of discrete parallel planes separated by a constant parameter d. It was proposed that the incident X-ray radiation would produce a Bragg peak if their reflections off the various planes interfered constructively. The interference is constructive when the phase shift is a multiple of 2Ï€; this condition can be expressed by Bragg's law,	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Diffusion_rayleigh_et_diffraction.png/400px-Diffusion_rayleigh_et_diffraction.png
