241.50	Gold	Gold	Gold ( ) is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: "gold") and an atomic number of 79. Gold is a dense, soft, shiny, malleable and ductile metal. Pure gold has a bright yellow color and luster traditionally considered attractive, which it maintains without oxidizing in air or water. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive solid chemical elements. The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, usually with tellurium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Gold-crystals.jpg/250px-Gold-crystals.jpg
