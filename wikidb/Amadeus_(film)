55.1	Amadeus_(film)	Amadeus (film)	Amadeus is a 1984 period drama film directed by Miloš Forman and written by Peter Shaffer. Adapted from Shaffer's stage play Amadeus (1979), the story is a variation of Alexandr Pushkin's play Mozart i Salieri (Моцарт и Сальери, 1830), in which the composer Antonio Salieri recognizes the genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart but thwarts him out of envy. The story is set in Vienna, Austria, during the latter half of the 18th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/Amadeusmov.jpg/220px-Amadeusmov.jpg
