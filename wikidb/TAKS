1.00	TAKS	Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills	Every portion of the exam includes multiple choice questions. The high school reading and English language arts (combined reading and writing) tests also require students to answer three open-ended (short answer) questions: one on the literary selection, one on the expository piece, and one "crossover" synthesizing the two. The writing and ELA tests include a written composition as well. The 9th-11th grade reading test permits the use of a dictionary and/or thesaurus, and the high school math and science tests allow the use of calculators along with formula charts. Currently, the TAKS is not timed.
