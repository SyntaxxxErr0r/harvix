3.00	Festina	Festina	Festina is a watch company. It was founded in 1902 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. The manufacture's motto was Festina Lente (Latin for 'Hasten slowly'). In 1984, Spanish industrialist Miguel Rodriguez, already owner of Lotus watches bought Festina and created the group Festina Lotus S.A.. Since this takeover, the company headquarters have been located in Barcelona, Spain. Their watches are exclusively assembled on Citizen Watch Company Japanese movements, and therefore are no longer Swiss Made. Festina owns now Candino Watch Company in Bienne, Switzerland, the seat of their Swiss distribution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Festina_watches.JPG/220px-Festina_watches.JPG
