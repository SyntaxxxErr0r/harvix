1.20	AB_Action	German AB-Aktion in Poland	AB-Aktion (English: ), was a Nazi German campaign during World War II aimed to eliminate the intellectuals and the upper classes of the Polish people and of Polish nationhood. In the spring and summer of 1940, more than 30,000 Poles were arrested by the Nazi authorities in German-occupied Poland. About 7,000 leaders and professors, teachers and priests (labeled as suspected of criminal activities) were subsequently massacred at various locations including at the Palmiry Forest. The others were sent to German concentration camps.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Polish_hostages_preparing_by_Nazi_Germans_for_mass_execution_1940.jpg/220px-Polish_hostages_preparing_by_Nazi_Germans_for_mass_execution_1940.jpg
