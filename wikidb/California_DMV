1.00	California_DMV	California Department of Motor Vehicles	The California Department of Motor Vehicles is the state agency responsible for the registration of motor vehicles and boats and the issuance of driver's licenses in the U.S. state of California. It is responsible for regulating new car dealers (through the New Motor Vehicle Board), commercial cargo carriers, private driving schools, and private traffic schools. DMV works with the Superior Courts of California to ensure that convictions are promptly recorded against drivers' licenses and that licenses are subsequently suspended or revoked when too many convictions are accumulated (as measured by a point-based system). DMV also issues identification cards for persons who are ineligible for or do not wish to have a driver's license.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/61/DMV_logo.png
