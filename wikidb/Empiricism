93.2	Empiricism	Empiricism	Empiricism is a theory of knowledge that asserts that knowledge comes only or primarily via sensory experience. One of several views of epistemology, the study of human knowledge, along with rationalism, idealism and historicism, empiricism emphasizes the role of experience and evidence, especially sensory perception, in the formation of ideas, over the notion of innate ideas or traditions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/John_Locke.jpg/220px-John_Locke.jpg
