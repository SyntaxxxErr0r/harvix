119.7	Learning	Learning	Learning is acquiring new, or modifying existing, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences and may involve synthesizing different types of information. The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals and some machines. Progress over time tends to follow learning curves. Learning is not compulsory, it is contextual. It does not happen all at once, but builds upon and is shaped by what we already know. To that end, learning may be viewed as a process,rather than a collection of factual and procedural knowledge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg/225px-Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg
