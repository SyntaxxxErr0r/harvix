6.40	Liberal_and_moderate_movements_within_Islam	Liberal movements within Islam	Progressive Muslims have produced a considerable body of liberal thought within Islam or "progressive Islam" . The methodology of reform can be classified into two groups, one depending on re-interpreting the traditional texts which constitutes Islamic law (ijtihad); this varies widely from little deviation from the traditional interpretation, to the more liberal which considers only the meaning of Qur'an as a divine inspiration, while the wording is believed to be from the prophet Muhammad intended by him to suit his time and situation, therefore interpreting the problematic verses in modern times allegorically or even not considering them. The second is questioning the authentic status applied to texts by the Traditional Islamic Scholars, resulting in the most liberal case as of the Qur'an Alone Muslims in rejecting the Islamic narratives of the sayings and practises of Prophet Muhammad, namely the Hadith completely.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Allah-eser-green.png/180px-Allah-eser-green.png
