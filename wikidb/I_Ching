The book contains a divination system comparable to Western geomancy or the West African Ifá system; in Western cultures and modern East Asia, it is still widely used for this purpose.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/I_Ching_Song_Dynasty_print.jpg/208px-I_Ching_Song_Dynasty_print.jpg
