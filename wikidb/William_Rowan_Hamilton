66.4	William_Rowan_Hamilton	William Rowan Hamilton	Sir William Rowan Hamilton (4 August 1805 â€“ 2 September 1865) was an Irish physicist, astronomer, and mathematician, who made important contributions to classical mechanics, optics, and algebra. His studies of mechanical and optical systems led him to discover new mathematical concepts and techniques. His greatest contribution is perhaps the reformulation of Newtonian mechanics, now called Hamiltonian mechanics. This work has proven central to the modern study of classical field theories such as electromagnetism, and to the development of quantum mechanics. In mathematics, he is perhaps best known as the inventor of quaternions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/William_Rowan_Hamilton_portrait_oval_combined.png/200px-William_Rowan_Hamilton_portrait_oval_combined.png
