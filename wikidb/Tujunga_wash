2.00	Tujunga_wash	Tujunga Wash	Tujunga Wash is a 13.0-mile-long (20.9 km) stream in Los Angeles County, California. It is a tributary of the Los Angeles River, providing about a fifth of its flow, and drains about 225 square miles (580 km2). It is called a wash because it is usually dry, especially the lower reaches, only carrying significant flows during and after storms, which usually only occur between November and April.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Tujunga_Wash.JPG/200px-Tujunga_Wash.JPG
