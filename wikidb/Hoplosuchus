1.00	Hoplosuchus	Hoplosuchus	Hoplosuchus is a genus of crocodylomorph. It is so far only known definitely from one specimen, a skeleton collected from sandstone of the Upper Jurassic-age Morrison Formation rocks at Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, during road construction. The individual was small, approximately 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long, although it may have been very young. It is perhaps the basalmost known crocodylomorph of the Morrison Formation, as suggested by such attributes as still having antorbital fenestrae in the skull. The limbs were relatively long, suggesting that the animal was terrestrial. Two rows of bony scutes ran down the back. The crowns of the teeth are not well preserved, so the diet cannot be determined with certainty. Given its small size, it probably ate insects and small vertebrates; it may have been carnivorous or omnivorous.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Hoplosuchus.jpg/250px-Hoplosuchus.jpg
