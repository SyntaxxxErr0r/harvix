1.00	%CA%B4	R-colored vowel	In phonetics, an R-colored or rhotic vowel (also called a vocalic R or a rhotacized vowel) is a vowel that is modified in a way that results in a lowering in frequency of the third formant. R-colored vowels can be articulated in various ways; the tip or blade of the tongue may be turned up during at least part of the articulation of the vowel (a retroflex articulation) or the back of the tongue may be bunched: in addition the vocal tract may often be constricted in the region of the epiglottis. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, an R-colored vowel is indicated by a modification placed to the right of the regular symbol for the vowel. For example, the IPA symbol for schwa is ə, while the IPA symbol for an R-colored schwa is ɚ.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Rhoticity_spectrogramf.png/300px-Rhoticity_spectrogramf.png
