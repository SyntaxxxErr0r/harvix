52.1	Enlargement_of_the_European_Union	Enlargement of the European Union	The Enlargement of the European Union is the process of expanding the European Union (EU) through the accession of new member states. This process began with the Inner Six, who founded the European Coal and Steel Community (the EU's predecessor) in 1952. Since then, the EU's membership has grown to twenty-seven with the most recent expansion to Bulgaria and Romania in 2007.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/EC-EU-enlargement_animation.gif/300px-EC-EU-enlargement_animation.gif
