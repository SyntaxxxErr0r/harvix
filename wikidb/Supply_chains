8.21	Supply_chains	Supply chain	A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, technology, activities, information and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. Supply chain activities transform natural resources, raw materials and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Supply_and_demand_network_%28en%29.png/400px-Supply_and_demand_network_%28en%29.png
