98.0	Arts_and_Crafts_Movement	Arts and Crafts movement	Arts and Crafts was an international design movement that flourished between 1860 and 1910, especially in the second half of that period, continuing its influence until the 1930s. It was led by the artist and writer William Morris (1834–1896) and the architect Charles Voysey (1857–1941) during the 1860s, and was inspired by the writings of John Ruskin (1819–1900) and Augustus Pugin (1812–1852). It developed first and most fully in the British Isles, but spread to Europe and North America. It was largely a reaction against the impoverished state of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms and often applied medieval, romantic or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and has been said to be essentially anti-industrial.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/William_Morris_design_for_Trellis_wallpaper_1862.jpg/300px-William_Morris_design_for_Trellis_wallpaper_1862.jpg
