7.10	Daisywheel_printer	Daisy wheel printer	Daisy wheel printers use an impact printing technology invented in 1969 by David S. Lee at Diablo Data Systems. It uses interchangeable pre-formed type elements, each with typically 96 glyphs, to generate high-quality output comparable to premium typewriters such as the IBM Selectric, but two to three times faster. Daisy-wheel printing was used in electronic typewriters, word processors and computer systems from 1972. According to Webster's, the daisy wheel is so named because of its resemblance to the flower.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Xerox_Roman_PS_Daisywheel_-_mono.jpg/220px-Xerox_Roman_PS_Daisywheel_-_mono.jpg
