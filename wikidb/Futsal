66.1	Futsal	Futsal	Futsal is a variant of association football that is played on a smaller pitch indoors. Its name is a portmanteau of the Portuguese futebol de salão and the Spanish fútbol de salón (colloquially fútbol sala), which can be translated as "hall football" or "indoor football". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the name fútbol Sala was used. Since then, all other names have been officially and internationally changed to futsal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Futebol_Salao_Pan2007.jpg/250px-Futebol_Salao_Pan2007.jpg
