3.10	QTS	Qualified Teacher Status	The PGCE is one-year course for existing undergraduate degree holders and the most-common way to train to become a teacher. It is based at and coordinated by a university or other higher education institution, though students spend a large proportion of the course on teaching practice at placement schools. The PGCE carries credits towards a master's degree.
