1.20	Ringspecies	Ring species	In biology, a ring species is a connected series of neighboring populations, each of which can interbreed with closely sited related populations, but for which there exist at least two "end" populations in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed, though there is a potential gene flow between each "linked" species. Such non-breeding, though genetically connected, "end" populations may co-exist in the same region thus closing a "ring".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Ring_species_diagram.svg/300px-Ring_species_diagram.svg.png
