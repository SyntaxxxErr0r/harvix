4.21	Oboe_Concerto_(Mozart)	Oboe Concerto (Mozart)	The Flute Concerto No. 2 in D Major is an adaptation of the original oboe concerto. Dutch flautist Ferdinand De Jean (1731â€“1797) commissioned Mozart for four flute quartets and three flute concerti; which Mozart only completed three quartets and only one new flute concerto. Instead of creating a new second concerto, Mozart rearranged the oboe concerto he had written a year earlier as the second flute concerto, although with substantial changes for it to fit with what the composer deemed flute-like. However, De Jean did not pay Mozart for this concerto because it was based on the oboe concerto.
