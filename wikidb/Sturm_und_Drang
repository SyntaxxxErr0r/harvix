83.5	Sturm_und_Drang	Sturm und Drang	Sturm und Drang is a proto-Romantic movement in German literature and music taking place from the late 1760s through the early 1780s, in which individual subjectivity and, in particular, extremes of emotion were given free expression in reaction to the perceived constraints of rationalism imposed by the Enlightenment and associated aesthetic movements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Hamann.jpg/150px-Hamann.jpg
