72.6	Pipeline_(Unix)	Pipeline (Unix)	In Unix-like computer operating systems (and, to some extent, Microsoft Windows), a pipeline is the original software pipeline: a set of processes chained by their standard streams, so that the output of each process feeds directly as input (stdin) to the next one. Each connection is implemented by an anonymous pipe. Filter programs are often used in this configuration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Pipeline.svg/280px-Pipeline.svg.png
