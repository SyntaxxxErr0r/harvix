311.5	Climate_change	Climate change	Climate change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in average weather conditions or the distribution of events around that average (e.g., more or fewer extreme weather events). Climate change may be limited to a specific region or may occur across the whole Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/ShipTracks_MODIS_2005may11.jpg/180px-ShipTracks_MODIS_2005may11.jpg
