85.5	Human_genome	Human genome	The human genome is stored on 23 chromosome pairs and in the small mitochondrial DNA. Twenty-two of the 23 chromosomes belong to autosomal chromosome pairs, while the remaining pair is sex determinative. The haploid human genome occupies a total of just over three billion DNA base pairs. The Human Genome Project (HGP) produced a reference sequence of the euchromatic human genome, which is used worldwide in the biomedical sciences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Karyotype.png/300px-Karyotype.png
