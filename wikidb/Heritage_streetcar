10.42	Heritage_streetcar	Heritage streetcar	Heritage streetcars or heritage trams are a development of the heritage railways that are becoming popular across the world. As with modern streetcar systems, the vehicles are referred to as trams or tramcars in the United Kingdom, Australasia and certain other places (with tramway being the line or system), but as streetcars or trolleys in North America. The last two terms are often used interchangeably in the United States, with trolley being preferred in the eastern U.S. and streetcar in Canada and the western U.S.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/MemphisTrolley.jpg/220px-MemphisTrolley.jpg
