206.4	Natural_language_processing	Natural language processing	Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence (also called machine learning), and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. Specifically, the process of a computer extracting meaningful information from natural language input and/or producing natural language output. In theory, natural language processing is a very attractive method of humanâ€“computer interaction. Natural language understanding is sometimes referred to as an AI-complete problem because it seems to require extensive knowledge about the outside world and the ability to manipulate it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Automated_online_assistant.png/170px-Automated_online_assistant.png
