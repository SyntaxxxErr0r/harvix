51.5	Marfa_lights	Marfa lights	The Marfa lights, also known as the Marfa ghost lights, have been observed near U.S. Route 67 on Mitchell Flat east of Marfa, Texas, in the United States. They have gained some fame as onlookers have ascribed them to paranormal phenomena such as ghosts, UFOs, or Will-o'-the-wisp, etc. However, research suggests that most, if not all, are atmospheric reflections of automobile headlights and campfires.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/USA_Marfa_Lights_Viewing_Platform_TX.jpg/220px-USA_Marfa_Lights_Viewing_Platform_TX.jpg
