For most Tibetans it is the most sacred and important temple in Tibet. It is in some regards pan-sectarian, but is presently controlled by the Gelug school. The temple's architectural style is a mixture of Indian vihara design, Chinese Tang Dynasty design, and Nepalese design.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Jokhang_Temple_in_Tibet.jpg/220px-Jokhang_Temple_in_Tibet.jpg
