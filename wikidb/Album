113.5	Album	Album	An album may be understood as a collection of recordings, released as a single package on gramophone record, cassette, compact disc, or via digital distribution, however the concept is found in printed music dating into the early nineteenth century in works by composers such as Schumann and Mendelssohn. The word derives from the Latin word for list.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Earlyalbum1.jpg/250px-Earlyalbum1.jpg
