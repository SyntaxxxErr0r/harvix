108.6	Scrabble	Scrabble	Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by forming words from individual lettered tiles on a gameboard marked with a 15-by-15 grid. The words are formed across and down in crossword fashion and must appear in a standard dictionary. Official reference works (e.g., The Official Club and Tournament Word List, The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary) provide a list of permissible words.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Scrabble_United_Kingdom.png
