3.00	Crossword_puzzles	Crossword	A crossword is a word puzzle that normally takes the form of a square or a rectangular grid of white and shaded squares. The goal is to fill the white squares with letters, forming words or phrases, by solving clues which lead to the answers. In languages that are written left-to-right, the answer words and phrases are placed in the grid from left to right and from top to bottom. The shaded squares are used to separate the words or phrases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/CrosswordUSA.svg/250px-CrosswordUSA.svg.png
