75.0	Federation	Federation	A federation (Latin: foedus, foederis, 'covenant'), also known as a federal state, is a type of sovereign state characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions united by a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of the central government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Map_of_federal_states.svg/300px-Map_of_federal_states.svg.png
