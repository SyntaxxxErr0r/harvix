76.5	The_Jackson_5	The Jackson 5	The Jackson 5 (also spelled The Jackson Five, or The Jackson 5ive), later known as The Jacksons, or simply Jackson, were an American popular music family group from Gary, Indiana. Founding group members Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael formed the group after performing in an early incarnation called The Jackson Brothers, which originally consisted of a trio of the three older brothers. Active from 1964 to 1990, the Jacksons played from a repertoire of R&amp;B, soul, pop and (in the 1970s) disco. During their six-and-a-half-year Motown tenure, The Jackson 5 were one of the biggest pop-music acts of the 1970s, and the band served as the launching pad for the solo careers of their lead singers Jermaine and Michael, the latter brother later transforming his early Motown solo fame into greater success as an adult artist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Jackson_5_tv_special_1972.JPG/220px-Jackson_5_tv_special_1972.JPG
