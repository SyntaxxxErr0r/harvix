In 1925, she wrote the adventure novel Copper Mountain: Adventurous Days Among the Eskimos partly based on the books of Vilhjalmur Stefansson. In 1930 she published her novel, White Jade, a historical novel about Yang Kuei-fei telling how Po Chu'i (Bo Juyi) came to write his famous poem "Everlasting Sorrow" about Yang.

They ran the magazine out of an adobe house called Casa Tierra which they built and lived in. When it was completed in 1947, it was reportedly the largest secular adobe in North America. They wrote of their experience in a book entitled How We Built An Adobe House For World Youth. Because of the acoustics, which he considered ideal, their friend famed violinist Yehudi Menuhin loved to play the violin in the great room.
