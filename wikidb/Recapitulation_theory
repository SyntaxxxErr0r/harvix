61.5	Recapitulation_theory	Recapitulation theory	The theory of recapitulation, also called the biogenetic law or embryological parallelism—and often expressed as "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"—is a disproven biological hypothesis that in developing from embryo to adult, animals go through stages resembling or representing successive stages in the evolution of their remote ancestors. With different formulations, such ideas have been applied and extended to several fields and areas, including the origin of language, biology, cognition and mental activities, anthropology, education theory and developmental psychology. While some examples of embryonic stages showing superficial features of ancestral organisms exist, the theory of recapitulation itself has been completely disproven within the field of biology. By contrast, there is no consensus against its validity outside of biology; recapitulation theory is still considered plausible and applied by some reasearchers in fields like Behavioral Development, the study of the origin of language, and others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/220px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png
