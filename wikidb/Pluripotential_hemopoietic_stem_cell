8.00	Pluripotential_hemopoietic_stem_cell	Hematopoietic stem cell	Hematopoietic stem cells , also spelled h√¶matopoietic stem cells, are multipotent stem cells that give rise to all the blood cell types from the myeloid (monocytes and macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, megakaryocytes/platelets, dendritic cells), and lymphoid lineages (T-cells, B-cells, NK-cells). The definition of haematopoietic stem cells has undergone considerable revision in the last two decades. The hematopoietic tissue contains cells with long-term and short-term regeneration capacities and committed multipotent, oligopotent, and unipotent progenitors. HSCs constitute 1:10.000 of cells in myeloid tissue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Blood_cells_differentiation_chart.jpg/250px-Blood_cells_differentiation_chart.jpg
