57.1	Blacklist	Blacklist	A blacklist (or black list) is a list or register of entities who, for one reason or another, are being denied a particular privilege, service, mobility, access or recognition. As a verb, to blacklist can mean to deny someone work in a particular field, or to ostracize a person from a certain social circle. Conversely, a whitelist is a list or compilation identifying entities that are accepted, recognized, or privileged.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Blacklist-irc.jpg/240px-Blacklist-irc.jpg
