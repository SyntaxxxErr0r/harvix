2.00	Fluidounce	Fluid ounce	A fluid ounce (abbreviated fl oz, fl. oz. or oz. fl.) is a unit of volume equal to about 28.4 ml in the imperial system or about 29.6 ml in the US system. The fluid ounce is distinct from the ounce, which measures mass. However, the fluid ounce is sometimes referred to simply as an "ounce" in applications where the volumetric "fluid ounce" is implied by context.
