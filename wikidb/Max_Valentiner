1.01	Max_Valentiner	Max Valentiner	Captain Christian August Max Ahlmann Valentiner (December 15, 1883 - July 19, 1949) was a German U-boat commander during World War I. He was the third highest-scoring U-boat commander of the war, and was awarded the Pour le MÃ©rite, the highest Prussian military order until the end of the war, for his achievements. He was also branded a war criminal by the Allies, for killing hundreds of civilians by sinking the SS Persia without first firing a warning shot on December 30, 1915, which contravened both international law and the Rules of Prize Warfare.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Max_Valentiner.jpg/250px-Max_Valentiner.jpg
