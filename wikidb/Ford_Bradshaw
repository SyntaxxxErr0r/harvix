1.00	Ford_Bradshaw	Ford Bradshaw	Ford Bradshaw (1908-March 3, 1934) was an American criminal bank robber and Depression-era outlaw. He was a rival of fellow Sooner, Oklahoma bandit Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd, and although never as nationally well-known as Floyd, Bradshaw's small town bank raids far exceeded those of Floyd during his criminal career.
