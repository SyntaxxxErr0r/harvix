71.3	Lutheran	Lutheranism	Lutheranism is a major branch of Western Christianity that identifies with the theology of Martin Luther, a German reformer. Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the Roman Catholic Church launched the Protestant Reformation. Beginning with the 95 Theses, Luther's writings were disseminated internationally, spreading the ideas of the Reformation beyond the ability of governmental and churchly authorities to control it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Lutherrose.svg/125px-Lutherrose.svg.png
