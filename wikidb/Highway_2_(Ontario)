10.20	Highway_2_(Ontario)	Ontario Highway 2	King's Highway 2, commonly referred to as Highway 2 is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. Once the primary eastâ€“west route across the southern end of the province, Highway 2 became mostly redundant in the 1960s following the completion of Highway 401, which more or less bypassed it. Consequently, most of the 837.4 km (520.3 mi) length of Highway 2 was deemed a local route and removed from the provincial highway system on January 1, 1998, with the exception of a 1-kilometre (0.62 mi) section east of Gananoque.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Highway2-1996.PNG/290px-Highway2-1996.PNG
