77.8	Somerset	Somerset	The ceremonial and non-metropolitan county of Somerset in South West England borders Bristol and Gloucestershire to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east, and Devon to the south-west. It is partly bounded to the north and west by the Bristol Channel and the estuary of the River Severn. Its traditional northern border is the River Avon, but the administrative boundary has crept southwards with the creation and expansion of the City of Bristol, and latterly the county of Avon and its successor unitary authorities to the north. Somerset's county town, Taunton, is in the south.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Somerset_UK_locator_map_2010.svg/200px-Somerset_UK_locator_map_2010.svg.png
