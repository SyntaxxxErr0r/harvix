107.5	Pinhole_camera	Pinhole camera	A pinhole camera is a simple camera without a lens and with a single small aperture â€“ effectively a light-proof box with a small hole in one side. Light from a scene passes through this single point and projects an inverted image on the opposite side of the box. The human eye in bright light acts similarly, as do cameras using small apertures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Pinhole-camera.svg/220px-Pinhole-camera.svg.png
