105.0	John_Brown_(abolitionist)	John Brown (abolitionist)	John Brown (May 9, 1800 â€“ December 2, 1859) was an American revolutionary abolitionist, who in the 1850s advocated and practiced armed insurrection as a means to abolish slavery in the United States. He led the Pottawatomie Massacre, during which five men were killed, in 1856 in Bleeding Kansas, and made his name in the unsuccessful raid at Harpers Ferry in 1859. Later that year he was executed but his speeches at the trial captured national attention. Brown has been called "the most controversial of all 19th-century Americans" and "America's first domestic terrorist."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/John_Brown_daguerreotype_c1856.png/220px-John_Brown_daguerreotype_c1856.png
