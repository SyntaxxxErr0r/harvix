68.8	Whose_Line_Is_It_Anyway%3F	Whose Line Is It Anyway?	Whose Line Is It Anyway? (abbreviated to Whose Line? or WLIIA) is a short-form improvisational comedy TV show. Originally a British radio programme, it moved to television in 1988 as a series made for the UK's Channel 4, for a 10 series run. Following the conclusion of the British run in 1998, ABC began airing a version with the same name for an American audience, which lasted eight seasons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/Whoseline.jpg/250px-Whoseline.jpg
