27.27	Carbon_fixation	Carbon fixation	In biology, carbon fixation is the reduction of carbon dioxide to organic compounds by living organisms. The obvious example is photosynthesis. Carbon fixation requires both a source of energy such as sunlight, and an electron donor such as water. All life depends on fixed carbon. Organisms that grow by fixing carbon are called autotrophsâ€”plants for example. Heterotrophs, like animals, are organisms which grow by using the fixed carbon produced by autotrophs. Some organisms can go either way. Fixed carbon, reduced carbon, and organic carbon all mean organic compounds. Carbon dioxide, in all its guises, is inorganic carbon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/20100422_235222_Cyanobacteria.jpg/220px-20100422_235222_Cyanobacteria.jpg
