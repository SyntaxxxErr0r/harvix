1.00	Sgurr_Choinnich_Mor	Grey Corries	The Grey Corries are a range of mountains in the West Highlands of Scotland. The range includes several of Scotland's highest peaks including a number of Munros. The range is bounded to the north by the great extent of Leanachan Forest beyond which is Glen Spean and the Great Glen, to the east by the defile of Lairig Leacach and to the south by upper Glen Nevis and the headwaters of the Abhainn Rath. The ridge continues westwards at a high level to join Aonach Beag, Aonach Mor, Carn Mor Dearg and Ben Nevis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Grey_Corries_from_the_north.jpg/225px-Grey_Corries_from_the_north.jpg
