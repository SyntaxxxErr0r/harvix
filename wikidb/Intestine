51.4	Intestine	Intestine	In human anatomy, the intestine (or bowel) is the segment of the alimentary canal extending from the pyloric sphincter of the stomach to the anus and, in humans and other mammals, consists of two segments, the small intestine and the large intestine. In humans, the small intestine is further subdivided into the duodenum, jejunum and ileum while the large intestine is subdivided into the cecum and colon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Stomach_colon_rectum_diagram.svg/252px-Stomach_colon_rectum_diagram.svg.png
