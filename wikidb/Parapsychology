67.1	Parapsychology	Parapsychology	The term parapsychology was coined in or around 1889 by philosopher Max Dessoir, and originates from para meaning "alongside", and psychology. The term was adopted by J.B. Rhine in the 1930s as a replacement for the term psychical research. Parapsychologists study a number of ostensible paranormal phenomena, including telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, near-death experiences, reincarnation and apparitional experiences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Wm_james.jpg/220px-Wm_james.jpg
