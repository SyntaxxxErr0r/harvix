64.5	British_Isles	British Isles	The British Isles are a group of islands off the northwest coast of continental Europe that include the islands of Great Britain and Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. There are two sovereign states located on the islands: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (commonly known as the United Kingdom) and the Republic of Ireland (officially and also known commonly as Ireland). The British Isles also include three dependencies of the British Crown: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Britain_and_Ireland_satellite_image_bright.png/220px-Britain_and_Ireland_satellite_image_bright.png
