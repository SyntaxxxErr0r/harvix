56.1	Lode_Runner	Lode Runner	Lode Runner is a 1983 platform game, first published by Br√∏derbund. It is one of the first games to include a level editor, a feature that allows players to create their own levels for the game. This feature bolstered the game's popularity, as magazines such as Computer Gaming World held contests to see who could build the best level. Tozai, Inc. currently holds the IP and Trademark rights of Lode Runner.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/35/Lode_Runner_Coverart.png
