15.63	Design_management	Design management	Design Management is a business discipline that uses project management, design, strategy, and supply chain techniques to control a creative process, support a culture of creativity, and build a structure and organisation for design. The objective of design management is to develop and maintain a business environment in which an organisation can achieve its strategic and mission goals through design, and by establishing and managing an efficient and effective system. Design management is a comprehensive activity at all levels of business (operational to strategic), from the discovery phase to the execution phase. "Simply put, design management is the business side of design. Design management encompasses the ongoing processes, business decisions, and strategies that enable innovation and create effectively-designed products, services, communications, environments, and brands that enhance our quality of life and provide organisational success." The discipline of design management overlaps with marketing management, operations management, and strategic management.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Design_Management_in_brief.jpg/220px-Design_Management_in_brief.jpg
