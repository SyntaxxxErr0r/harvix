Similar regulations cover driving or operating certain types of machinery while affected by drinking alcohol or taking other drugs. This is a criminal offense in most countries. Convictions do not necessarily involve actual driving of the vehicle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Polizeikontrolle_R%C3%BCgendamm.jpg/220px-Polizeikontrolle_R%C3%BCgendamm.jpg
