61.6	Color_space	Color space	A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers, typically as three or four values or color components (e.g. RGB and CMYK are color models). However, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Colorspace.png/220px-Colorspace.png
