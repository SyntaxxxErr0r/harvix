1.00	Secularism_in_Bangladesh	Secularism in Bangladesh	"Secularism", or Dhormo Niropekhota in Bengali, is one of the fundamental principles that drove the Bengali nationalist movement and subsequent Bangladesh Liberation War which led to the creation of Bangladesh, which had been founded as a democratic secular nation-state. The term Secularity had been induced into the original Constitution of Bangladesh in 1972 as one of the Four State Principles, the others being Democracy, Nationalism and Socialism. After the dramatic assassination in 1975 of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's founder, secularism would be condemned by subsequent military regimes and be eventually removed from the constitution by President Ziaur Rahman in 1977 by replacing the word "Secularity" with "Absolutue trust and faith in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all actions".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Durga_puja_in_Dhakeshwari_temple.jpg/250px-Durga_puja_in_Dhakeshwari_temple.jpg
