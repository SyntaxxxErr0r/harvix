84.9	Microprocessor	Microprocessor	A microprocessor incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit, (IC) or at most a few integrated circuits. It is a multipurpose, programmable device that accepts digital data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. It is an example of sequential digital logic, as it has internal memory. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Intel_4004.jpg/220px-Intel_4004.jpg
