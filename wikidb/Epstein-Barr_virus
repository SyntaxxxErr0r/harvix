70.0	Epstein-Barr_virus	Epstein–Barr virus	The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), also called human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), is a virus of the herpes family and is one of the most common viruses in humans. It is best known as the cause of infectious mononucleosis. It is also associated with particular forms of cancer, particularly Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and central nervous system lymphomas associated with HIV. Finally, there is evidence that infection with the virus is associated with a higher risk of certain autoimmune diseases, especially dermatomyositis , systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Epstein_Barr_Virus_virions_EM_10.1371_journal.pbio.0030430.g001-L.JPG/220px-Epstein_Barr_Virus_virions_EM_10.1371_journal.pbio.0030430.g001-L.JPG
