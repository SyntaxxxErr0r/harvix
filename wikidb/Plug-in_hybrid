77.7	Plug-in_hybrid	Plug-in hybrid	A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle , plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHV), or plug-in hybrid is a hybrid vehicle which utilizes rechargeable batteries, or another energy storage device, that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source (usually a normal electric wall socket). A PHEV shares the characteristics of both a conventional hybrid electric vehicle, having an electric motor and an internal combustion engine (ICE); and of an all-electric vehicle, having a plug to connect to the electrical grid. Most PHEVs on the road today are passenger cars, but there are also PHEV versions of commercial vehicles and vans, utility trucks, buses, trains, motorcycles, scooters, and military vehicles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Chevrolet_Volt_WAS_2010_8852.JPG/220px-Chevrolet_Volt_WAS_2010_8852.JPG
