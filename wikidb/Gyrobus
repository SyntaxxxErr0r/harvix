23.81	Gyrobus	Gyrobus	A Gyrobus is an electric bus that uses flywheel energy storage, not overhead wires like a trolleybus. The name comes from the Greek language term for flywheel, gyros. While there are no gyrobuses currently in use commercially, development in this area continues.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Gyrobus_G3-1.jpg/300px-Gyrobus_G3-1.jpg
