162.1	Flash_Video	Flash Video	Flash Video is a container file format used to deliver video over the Internet using Adobe Flash Player versions 6â€“11. Flash Video content may also be embedded within SWF files. There are two different video file formats known as Flash Video: FLV and F4V. The audio and video data within FLV files are encoded in the same manner as they are within SWF files. The latter F4V file format is based on the ISO base media file format and is starting with Flash Player 9 update 3. Both formats are supported in Adobe Flash Player and currently developed by Adobe Systems. FLV was originally developed by Macromedia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/FLVPacket.png/400px-FLVPacket.png
