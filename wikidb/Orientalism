99.0	Orientalism	Orientalism	Orientalism is a term used by art historians, literary and cultural studies scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects of Middle Eastern, and East Asian cultures by American and European writers, designers and artists. In particular, Orientalist painting, depicting more specifically "the Middle East", was one of the many specialisms of 19th century Academic art. Since the publication of Edward Said's Orientalism, the term has arguably acquired a negative connotation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Anonymous_Venetian_orientalist_painting%2C_The_Reception_of_the_Ambassadors_in_Damascus%27%2C_1511%2C_the_Louvre.jpg/300px-Anonymous_Venetian_orientalist_painting%2C_The_Reception_of_the_Ambassadors_in_Damascus%27%2C_1511%2C_the_Louvre.jpg
