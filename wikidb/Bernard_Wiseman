Directed by Fumihiko Takayama, it was also the first time anyone other than creator Yoshiyuki Tomino was given a chance to direct a Gundam story. Released in 1989, it serves to commemorate Gundam's ten-year anniversary. As suggested by its subtitle, "War in the Pocket," it is a small, personal story; a side story focusing on the experiences of a ten-year-old boy during the One Year War.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/24/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_0080_War_in_the_Pocket_DVD_vol_1.jpg
