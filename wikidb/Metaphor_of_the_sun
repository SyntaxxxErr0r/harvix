10.61	Metaphor_of_the_sun	Metaphor of the sun	Plato, in The Republic (507b-509c ), uses the sun as a metaphor for the source of "illumination", arguably intellectual illumination, which he held to be The Form of the Good, which is sometimes interpreted as Plato's notion of God. The metaphor is about the nature of ultimate reality and how knowledge is acquired concerning it. Socrates is the speaker of The Republic, but it is generally believed that the thoughts expressed are Plato's.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Plato-raphael.jpg/100px-Plato-raphael.jpg
