70.8	Dice	Dice	A die (plural dice, from Old French d√©, from Latin datum "something which is given or played") is a small throwable object with multiple resting positions, used for generating random numbers. This makes dice suitable as gambling devices for games like craps, or for use in non-gambling tabletop games.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/6sided_dice.jpg/250px-6sided_dice.jpg
