62.0	Foursquare_(social_network)	Foursquare	Foursquare, stylized as foursquare, is a location-based social networking website for mobile devices, such as smartphones. Users "check in" at venues using a mobile website, text messaging or a device-specific application by selecting from a list of venues the application locates nearby. Location is based on GPS hardware in the mobile device or network location provided by the application. Each check-in awards the user points and sometimes "badges".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Foursquare_logo.svg/230px-Foursquare_logo.svg.png
