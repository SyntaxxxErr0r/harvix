59.5	Syrup	Syrup	In cooking, a syrup (from Arabic: â€Ž; sharab, beverage, via Latin: ) is a thick, viscous liquid consisting primarily of a solution of sugar in water, containing a large amount of dissolved sugars but showing little tendency to deposit crystals. The viscosity arises from the multiple hydrogen bonds between the dissolved sugar, which has many hydroxyl (OH) groups, and the water. Syrups can be made by dissolving sugar in water or by reducing naturally sweet juices such as cane juice, sorghum juice, or maple sap. Corn syrup is made from corn starch using an enzymatic process that converts it to sugars. Technically and scientifically, the term syrup is also employed to denote viscous, generally residual, liquids, containing substances other than sugars in solution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Maple_syrup.jpg/220px-Maple_syrup.jpg
