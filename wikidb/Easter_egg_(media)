287.6	Easter_egg_(media)	Easter egg (media)	A virtual Easter egg is an intentional hidden message, in-joke, or feature in a work such as a computer program, web page, video game, movie, book, or crossword. The term was coined — according to Warren Robinett — by Atari after they were pointed to the secret message left by Robinett in the game Adventure. It draws a parallel with the custom of the Easter egg hunt observed in many Western nations as well as the last Russian imperial family's tradition of giving elaborately jeweled egg-shaped creations by Carl Fabergé which contained hidden surprises.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Carl_Oswald_Rostosky_-_Zwei_Kaninchen_und_ein_Igel_1861.jpg/250px-Carl_Oswald_Rostosky_-_Zwei_Kaninchen_und_ein_Igel_1861.jpg
