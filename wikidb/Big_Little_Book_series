10.21	Big_Little_Book_series	Big Little Book series	The Big Little Books, first published during 1932 by the Whitman Publishing Company of Racine, Wisconsin, were small, compact books designed with a captioned illustration opposite each page of text. Other publishers, notably Saalfield, adopted this format after Whitman achieved success with its early titles, priced initially at 10¢ each (later 15¢).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d9/BLB_W_1935_LAR2.JPG
