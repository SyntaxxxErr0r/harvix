172.2	Iron	Iron	Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe (from Latin: ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is the most common element (by mass) forming the planet Earth as a whole, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Iron's very common presence in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production as a result of fusion in high-mass stars, where the production of nickel-56 (which decays to the most common isotope of iron) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic. This causes radioactive nickel to become the last element to be produced before collapse of a supernova leads to the explosive events that scatter this precursor radionuclide of iron abundantly into space.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Iron_electrolytic_and_1cm3_cube.jpg/250px-Iron_electrolytic_and_1cm3_cube.jpg
