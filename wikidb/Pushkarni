2.00	Pushkarni	Temple tank	Temple tanks are wells or reservoirs built as part of the temple complex in Indian temples. Bathing in the sacred waters of these tanks is thought to cure disease and maladies. It is possible that these are cultural remnants of structures such as the Great Bath of Mohenjo-daro, which was part of the Indus Valley Civilization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Hampi5.JPG/150px-Hampi5.JPG
