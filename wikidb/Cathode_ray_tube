138.2	Cathode_ray_tube	Cathode ray tube	The cathode ray tube is a vacuum tube containing an electron gun (a source of electrons) and a fluorescent screen used to view images. It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam onto the fluorescent screen to create the images. The image may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, computer monitor), radar targets and others. CRTs have also been used as memory devices, in which case the visible light emitted from the fluoresecent material (if any) is not intended to have significant meaning to a visual observer (though the visible pattern on the tube face may cryptically represent the stored data).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/CRT_color_enhanced.png/250px-CRT_color_enhanced.png
