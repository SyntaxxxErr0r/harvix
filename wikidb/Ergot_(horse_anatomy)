1.02	Ergot_(horse_anatomy)	Ergot (horse anatomy)	The ergot is a small callosity on the underside of the fetlock of a horse or other equine. Some equines have them on all four fetlocks; others have few or no detectable ergots. In horses, the ergot varies from very small to the size of a pea or bean, larger ergots occurring in horses with "feather" - long hairs on the lower legs. In some other equines, the ergot can be as much as 1.5 inches in diameter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Pasterns.jpg/220px-Pasterns.jpg
