2.00	Ernest_G._McClain	Ernest G. McClain	Ernest G. McClain (born August 6, 1918 in Massillon, Ohio), is professor emeritus of music at Brooklyn College. He is known for his efforts to establish the ancient mathematical discipline of music as the means to unlock the deepest meaning of history's great religious and philosophical texts. His writings offer a persuasive explanation of crucial passages in texts of world literatureâ€”the Bible, the Rig Veda, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Plato -- that have defied experts in the concerned disciplines. All of these passages deal with numbers that have either been ignored or misinterpreted throughout the centuries. McClain is able to explain the meaning of these numbers within the context of four ancient mathematical disciplines: arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy. His discovery of identical or similar numbers and parallel mathematical constructs in Sumer, Egypt, Babylon, Palestine and Greece, confirms growing speculation about the historical continuity of a common spiritual tradition linking the microcosm of the soul to the macrocosm of the universe. His work provides much of the missing mathematical detail for what scholars often call the Music of the Spheres.
