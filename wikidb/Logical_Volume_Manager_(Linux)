60.4	Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)	Logical Volume Manager (Linux)	LVM is a logical volume manager for the Linux kernel; it manages disk drives and similar mass-storage devices. The term "volume" refers to a disk drive or partition thereof. It was originally written in 1998 by Heinz Mauelshagen, who based its design on that of the LVM in HP-UX.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/LVM1.svg/500px-LVM1.svg.png
