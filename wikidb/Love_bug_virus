3.00	Love_bug_virus	ILOVEYOU	ILOVEYOU, sometimes referred to as Love Letter, was a computer worm that attacked tens of millions of Windows personal computers on and after 5 May 2000 local time in the Philippines when it started spreading as an email message with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and the attachment "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.txt.". The first file extension 'VBS' was most often hidden by default on Windows computers of the time, leading unwitting users to think it was a normal text file. Opening the attachment activated the Visual Basic script. The worm did damage on the local machine, overwriting image files, and sent a copy of itself to the first 50 addresses in the Windows Address Book used by Microsoft Outlook.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/da/LoveLetterVBS_screenshot_website_06-17-09.png/240px-LoveLetterVBS_screenshot_website_06-17-09.png
