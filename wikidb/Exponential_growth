185.8	Exponential_growth	Exponential growth	Exponential growth (including exponential decay when the growth rate is negative) occurs when the growth rate of the value of a mathematical function is proportional to the function's current value. In the case of a discrete domain of definition with equal intervals it is also called geometric growth or geometric decay (the function values form a geometric progression).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Exponential.svg/300px-Exponential.svg.png
