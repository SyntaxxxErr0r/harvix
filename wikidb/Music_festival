They are commonly held outdoors, and are often inclusive of other attractions such as food and merchandise vending machines, performance art, and social activities. The Pythian Games at Delphi included musical performances, and may be one of the earliest festivals known. During the Middle Ages festivals were often held as competitions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Flickr_-_moses_namkung_-_M.I.A._7.jpg/220px-Flickr_-_moses_namkung_-_M.I.A._7.jpg
