1.00	Alzenau	Alzenau	Alzenau (until 31 December 2006 officially Alzenau i.UFr.) is a town in the north of the Aschaffenburg district in the Regierungsbezirk of Lower Franconia in Bavaria, Germany. The epithet “in Unterfranken” (“in Lower Franconia”), now dropped, was to distinguish it from another Alzenau since 1945 no longer in Germany. That place, now called Olszanka, is in Opole Voivodeship in Silesia, which since the Potsdam Agreement has been in Poland. Until 1 July 1972, Alzenau was the district seat of the now abolished district of the same name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Alzenau_Rathaus.JPG/268px-Alzenau_Rathaus.JPG
