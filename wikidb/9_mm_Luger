8.00	9_mm_Luger	9×19mm Parabellum	The 9×19mm Parabellum (abbreviated 9mm, 9×19mm or 9×19) cartridge was designed by Georg Luger and introduced in 1902 by the German weapons manufacturer Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) for their Luger semi-automatic pistol. For this reason, it is commonly called the 9 mm Luger cartridge, differentiating it from the 9mm Makarov and 9mm Browning (.380 ACP) cartridges.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/9mmLuger.jpg/300px-9mmLuger.jpg
