1.00	Gina_Elise	Pin-ups for Vets	Pin-ups For Vets is a non-profit charitable organization dedicated to helping injured and ill American soldiers, Marines, airmen, Guards, and seamenâ€”and current active-duty personnel. The project is the work of Gina Elise who sells and distributes the Pin-ups For Vets Calendar, which hearkens back to 1940s and 1950-style vintage pretty-girl images. The calendars are considered very tasteful by today's standards; they contain no frontal nudity, or nudity of any kind. Ms. Elise appears in various types of period costume and lingerie. To date, the organization has donated over $50,000 to veteran hospitals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Pin-ups_for_Vets_%28logo%29.JPG/250px-Pin-ups_for_Vets_%28logo%29.JPG
