6.00	Formal_cause	Four causes	Four Causes refers to a principle in Aristotelian thought that is used to understand how four fundamental causes result in change. Aristotle described the causes, or ways in which an object could be explained as: "we do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause", He argued that, in order to understand an object, especially changes that the object might undergo, one has to understand its four causes. "Cause" might be better translated as "explanatory conditions and factors". There are four such causes: 1) the form of the object (which will be altered during a change); 2) the matter underlying the object (which will usually not be altered during a change); 3) the agency that brings about the change; and 4) the purpose served by the change. These are called, respectively, the formal cause, the material cause, the efficient cause, and the final cause. While there are cases where identifying a cause is difficult, or in which causes might merge, Aristotle was convinced that his four causes provided an analytical scheme of general applicability.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Aristoteles_Louvre.jpg/100px-Aristoteles_Louvre.jpg
