119.7	Hell	Hell	In many religious traditions, hell is a place of suffering and punishment in the afterlife. Religions with a linear divine history often depict hells as endless. Religions with a cyclic history often depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations. Typically these traditions locate hell under the Earth's external surface and often include entrances to Hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include Heaven, Purgatory, Paradise, and Limbo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Hortus_Deliciarum_-_Hell.jpg/250px-Hortus_Deliciarum_-_Hell.jpg
