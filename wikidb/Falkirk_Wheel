78.0	Falkirk_Wheel	Falkirk Wheel	The Falkirk Wheel is a rotating boat lift in Scotland, UK. It connects the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal. Named after the nearby town of Falkirk in central Scotland, the lift opened in 2002. The two canals it serves were previously connected by a series of 11 locks, but by the 1930s these had fallen into disuse. The locks were filled in and the land built upon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/FalkirkWheelSide_2004_SeanMcClean.jpg/250px-FalkirkWheelSide_2004_SeanMcClean.jpg
