59.6	SS	Schutzstaffel	The origin of the SS came from a small permanent guard unit made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for Nazi Party meetings in Munich. Formed at the end of 1920, they were known as the "Saal-Schutz" (Hall-Protection). Later under the leadership of Heinrich Himmler between 1929 and 1945, the SS was renamed the "Schutz-Staffel" and grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the largest and most powerful organizations in the Third Reich.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Schutzstaffel_Abzeichen.svg/100px-Schutzstaffel_Abzeichen.svg.png
