Making a definitive diagnosis of the cause of abdominal pain can be difficult, because many diseases can result in this symptom. Abdominal pain is a common problem. Most frequently the cause is benign and/or self-limited, but more serious causes will and may require urgent intervention.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Gray1220.png/220px-Gray1220.png
