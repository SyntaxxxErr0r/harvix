67.1	Vocoder	Vocoder	Analog vocoders typically analyze an incoming signal by splitting the signal into a number of tuned frequency bands or ranges. A modulator and carrier signal are sent through a series of these tuned band pass filters. In the example of a typical robot voice the modulator is a microphone and the carrier is noise or a sawtooth waveform. There are usually between 8 and 20 bands.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Kraftwerk_Vocoder_custom_made_in_early1970s.JPG/250px-Kraftwerk_Vocoder_custom_made_in_early1970s.JPG
