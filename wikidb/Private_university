56.3	Private_university	Private university	Private universities are universities not operated by governments, although many receive public subsidies, especially in the form of tax breaks and public student loans and grants. Depending on their location, private universities may be subject to government regulation. This is in contrast to public universities and national universities. While many prominent private universities are run by charitable or non-profit organizations, a subset are commercial for-profit universities which are run as business organizations.
