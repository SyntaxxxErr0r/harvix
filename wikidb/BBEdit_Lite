3.11	BBEdit_Lite	BBEdit Lite	BBEdit Lite is a freeware text editor by Bare Bones Software, created as a low-cost, stripped-down or "lightweight" version of their flagship product BBEdit. BBEdit Lite had many of the same features as BBEdit such as regular expressions, a plug-in architecture and the same text editing engine. However, BBEdit Lite lacked programming and web-oriented tools such as syntax highlighting, a command line shell, HTML tools or FTP access.
