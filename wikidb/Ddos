84.4	Ddos	Denial-of-service attack	A denial-of-service attack or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Although the means to carry out, motives for, and targets of a DoS attack may vary, it generally consists of the concerted efforts of a person, or multiple people to prevent an Internet site or service from functioning efficiently or at all, temporarily or indefinitely.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Stachledraht_DDos_Attack.svg/220px-Stachledraht_DDos_Attack.svg.png
