66.1	Nuremberg_Defense	Superior orders	In 1474, in the trial of Peter von Hagenbach by an ad hoc tribunal of the Holy Roman Empire, there was the first known “international” recognition of commanders’ obligations to act lawfully. Hagenbach offered the defense that he was just following orders, but this defense was rejected and he was convicted of war crimes and beheaded.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Deutsche_Geschichte5-310.jpg/250px-Deutsche_Geschichte5-310.jpg
