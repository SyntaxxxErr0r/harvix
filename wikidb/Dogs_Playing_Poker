54.0	Dogs_Playing_Poker	Dogs Playing Poker	Dogs Playing Poker refers collectively to a series of sixteen oil paintings by C. M. Coolidge, commissioned in 1903 by Brown &amp; Bigelow to advertise cigars. All the paintings in the series feature anthropomorphized dogs, but the nine in which dogs are seated around a card table have become derisively well-known in the United States as examples of mainly working-class taste in home decoration. Critic Annette Ferrara describes Dogs Playing Poker as "indelibly burned into ... the American collective-schlock subconscious ... through incessant reproduction on all manner of pop ephemera."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Hisstationand4aces-coolidge.jpg/275px-Hisstationand4aces-coolidge.jpg
