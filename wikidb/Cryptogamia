1.00	Cryptogamia	Cryptogam	The name cryptogams is used fairly widely as a phrase of convenience, although regarded as an obsolete taxonomic term. A cryptogam is a plant (in the wide sense of the word) that reproduces by spores. The term cryptogam means hidden reproduction, and refers to the fact that there is no seed produced; therefore, the cryptogams represent the non-seed bearing vascular plants. Other names, such as "thallophytes", "lower plants" and "spore plants" are also occasionally used. The best known groups of cryptogams are algae, lichens, mosses and ferns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Polystichum_setiferum_001.jpg/220px-Polystichum_setiferum_001.jpg
