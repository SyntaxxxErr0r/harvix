3.00	LP_with_Apartment_213	Domestic Powerviolence	Domestic Powerviolence is a split LP/CD between Agoraphobic Nosebleed and Apartment 213 from Cleveland, Ohio. The album's cover art is a homage to Johnny Craig's cover art from the comic book The Vault of Horror's 35th issue, done by German artist Florian Bertmer. Agoraphobic Nosebleed's side is a departure from their usual micro-burst grind style. It features two distorted basses, no guitars, slower tempos, longer running times and constant shifts in tempo and time signature. Guest vocals from Apartment 213's Steve Makita are featured on every track, along with those of ANb vocalist Jay Randall. The overall sound is similar to that of powerviolence pioneers/legends Man Is The Bastard. Apartment 213's side is mostly re-recorded versions of previously released songs, dating as far back as their first 7" from the early 90's.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d4/Domestic_Powerviolence_cover.jpg/220px-Domestic_Powerviolence_cover.jpg
