2.00	Bullace	Bullace	The bullace is a variety of plum. It bears edible fruit similar to those of the damson, and like the damson is considered to be a strain of the insititia subspecies of Prunus domestica. Although the term has regionally been applied to several different kinds of "wild plum" found in the United Kingdom, it is usually taken to refer to varieties with a round shape, as opposed to the oval damsons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Late_summer_bounty_-_geograph.org.uk_-_243791.jpg/220px-Late_summer_bounty_-_geograph.org.uk_-_243791.jpg
