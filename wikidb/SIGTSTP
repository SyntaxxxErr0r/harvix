6.10	SIGTSTP	SIGTSTP	SIGTSTP is a signal in a Unix computer system that tells a program to stop temporarily. On POSIX-compliant platforms, SIGTSTP is the signal sent to a process by its controlling terminal when the user requests that the process be suspended. The symbolic constant for SIGTSTP is defined in the header file signal.h. Symbolic signal names are used because signal numbers can vary across platforms.
