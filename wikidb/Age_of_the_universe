56.6	Age_of_the_universe	Age of the universe	The age of the universe is the time elapsed since the Big Bang. The best current estimate of the age of the universe is 13.75 Â± 0.11 billion years (4.339 x 1017 seconds) within the Lambda-CDM concordance model. The uncertainty range of 0.11 billion years has been obtained by the agreement of a number of scientific research projects, such as microwave background radiation measurements by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and other probes. Measurements of the cosmic background radiation give the cooling time of the universe since the Big Bang, and measurements of the expansion rate of the universe can be used to calculate its approximate age by extrapolating backwards in time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/WMAP_2010.png/220px-WMAP_2010.png
