1.00	Pythian_Base_Ball_Club	Pythian Baseball Club	The Pythian Baseball Club was founded in 1867 and was the first black baseball club. It was founded by young African American leaders: Jacob C. White Jr. and Octavius V. Catto. The Pythians were composed of primarily business and middle class professionals from the surrounding areas of Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. Just two years after the Civil War ended, in 1867, the Pennsylvania State Convention of Baseball, located in Harrisburg, denied the "Pythian Baseball Club" out of Philadelphia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/Pythian_Baseball_Club.jpg
