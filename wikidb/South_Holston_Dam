It is the uppermost of three dams on the South Fork Holston owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the 1940s as part of efforts to control flooding in the Tennessee River watershed. The dam impounds the South Holston Lake of 7,550 acres (31 km2), which extends northeastward across the Tennessee-Virginia state line.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/South-holston-dam-tva1.jpg/220px-South-holston-dam-tva1.jpg
