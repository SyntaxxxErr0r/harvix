59.6	Card_counting	Card counting	Card counting is a casino card game strategy used primarily in the blackjack family of casino games to determine whether the next hand is likely to give a probable advantage to the player or to the dealer. Card counters, also known as advantage players, attempt to decrease the inherent casino house edge by keeping a running tally of all high and low valued cards seen by the player. Card counting allows players to bet more with less risk when the count gives an advantage as well as minimize losses during an unfavorable count. Card counting also provides the ability to alter playing decisions based on the composition of remaining cards. Card counting also refers to obtaining a count of the distribution or of the remaining high cards in trick-taking games such as contract bridge or spades.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Blackjack_board.JPG/300px-Blackjack_board.JPG
