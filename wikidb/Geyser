51.8	Geyser	Geyser	A geyser is a spring characterized by intermittent discharge of water ejected turbulently and accompanied by a vapour phase (steam). The word geyser comes from Geysir, the name of an erupting spring at Haukadalur, Iceland; that name, in turn, comes from the Icelandic verb geysa, "to gush", the verb itself from Old Norse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/GeysirEruptionNear.jpg/250px-GeysirEruptionNear.jpg
