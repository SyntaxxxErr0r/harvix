51.5	Flywheel_energy_storage	Flywheel energy storage	Flywheel energy storage works by accelerating a rotor (flywheel) to a very high speed and maintaining the energy in the system as rotational energy. When energy is extracted from the system, the flywheel's rotational speed is reduced as a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy; adding energy to the system correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/G2_front2.jpg/220px-G2_front2.jpg
