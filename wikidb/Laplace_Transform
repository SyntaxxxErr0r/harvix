3.21	Laplace_Transform	Laplace transform	When one says "the Laplace transform" without qualification, the unilateral or one-sided transform is normally intended. The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined as the bilateral Laplace transform or two-sided Laplace transform by extending the limits of integration to be the entire real axis. If that is done the common unilateral transform simply becomes a special case of the bilateral transform where the definition of the function being transformed is multiplied by the Heaviside step function.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/S-Domain_circuit_equivalency.svg/412px-S-Domain_circuit_equivalency.svg.png
