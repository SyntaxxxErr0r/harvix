168.6	Foie_gras	Foie gras	Foie gras (French: ); French for "fat liver") is a food product made of the liver of a duck or goose that has been specially fattened. This fattening is typically achieved through gavage (force-feeding corn), according to French law, though outside of France it is occasionally produced using natural feeding. A pastry containing pâté de foie gras and bacon, or pâté de foie gras tout court, was formerly known as "Strasbourg pie" (or "Strasburg pie") in English on account of that city's being a major producer of foie gras.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Foie_gras_en_cocotte.jpg/220px-Foie_gras_en_cocotte.jpg
