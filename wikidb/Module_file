30.28	Module_file	Module file	Module files are a family of music file formats originating from the MOD file format on Amiga systems used in the late 1980s. Those who produce these files (using the software called trackers) and listen to them, form the worldwide MOD scene, a part of the Demoscene subculture, which involves a large number of people in many countries of the world which is hard to count due to underground nature of this scene. The mass interchange of "MOD music" or "tracker music" (music stored in module files created with trackers) evolves from early FIDO networks. Nowadays most module files, including ones in zipped form, are supported by most popular media players such as Winamp, VLC, Amarok, Exaile and many others. Many websites host large numbers of these files, the most comprehensive of them being the Mod Archive.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Beyond_-_Conspiracy_-_2004_-_64k_intro.jpg/150px-Beyond_-_Conspiracy_-_2004_-_64k_intro.jpg
