3.00	Nerve_entrapment	Nerve compression syndrome	Nerve compression syndrome or compression neuropathy, also known as entrapment neuropathy, is a medical condition caused by direct pressure on a single nerve. It is known colloquially as a trapped nerve, though this may also refer to nerve root compression (by a herniated disc, for example). Its symptoms include pain, tingling, numbness, and muscle weakness. The symptoms affect just one particular part of the body, depending which nerve is affected. Nerve conduction studies help to confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, surgery may help to relieve the pressure on the nerve, but this does not always relieve all the symptoms.
