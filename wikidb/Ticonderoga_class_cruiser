15.83	Ticonderoga_class_cruiser	Ticonderoga class cruiser	The Ticonderoga class of missile cruisers is a class of warships in the United States Navy, first ordered and authorized in FY 1978. The class uses phased-array radar and was originally planned as a class of destroyers. However, the increased combat capability offered by the Aegis combat system and the AN/SPY-1 radar system was used to justify the change of the classification from DDG (guided missile destroyer) to CG (guided missile cruiser) shortly before the keels of Ticonderoga and Yorktown were laid down.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/US_Navy_030903-N-5024R-003_USS_Port_Royal_%28DDG_73%29_departed_on_deployment.jpg/300px-US_Navy_030903-N-5024R-003_USS_Port_Royal_%28DDG_73%29_departed_on_deployment.jpg
