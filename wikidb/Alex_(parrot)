52.7	Alex_(parrot)	Alex (parrot)	Alex (1976 – September 6, 2007) was an African Grey Parrot and the subject of a thirty-year (1977–2007) experiment by animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg, initially at the University of Arizona and later at Harvard University and Brandeis University. Pepperberg bought Alex in a regular pet shop when he was about one year old. The name Alex is an acronym for Avian Language EXperiment, but Pepperberg later cited the name as meaning Avian Learning EXperiment to evoke further acceptance in her research field, a then touchy topic (explained in her book, Alex &amp; Me). His successor was Griffin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Alex_the_Parrot.jpg/200px-Alex_the_Parrot.jpg
