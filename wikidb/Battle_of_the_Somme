64.1	Battle_of_the_Somme	Battle of the Somme	The Battle of the Somme (French: , German: ), also known as the Somme Offensive, took place during the First World War between 1 July and 18 November 1916 on either side of the river Somme in France. The battle saw the British Army, supported by contingents from British imperial territories including Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, Canada, India and South Africa, mount a joint offensive with the French Army against the German Army, which had occupied large areas of France since its invasion of the country in August 1914. The Battle of the Somme was one of the largest battles of the war; by the time fighting paused in late autumn 1916 the forces involved had suffered more than 1 million casualties, making it one of the bloodiest military operations ever recorded.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Cheshire_Regiment_trench_Somme_1916.jpg/250px-Cheshire_Regiment_trench_Somme_1916.jpg
