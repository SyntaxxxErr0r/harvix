Scouting makes it possible for the young men and women to learn more about their Hungarian heritage, language and culture. The organization is dedicated to carrying out its obligations at four levels: God, their adopted countries, their fellow man and the Hungarian nation. The Boy Scout and Girl Guide units meet in conjunction with Hungarian weekend schools, which in many instances they also operate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/Magyar_Cserk%C3%A9szsz%C3%B6vets%C3%A9g.png/140px-Magyar_Cserk%C3%A9szsz%C3%B6vets%C3%A9g.png
