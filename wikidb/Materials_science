76.6	Materials_science	Materials science	Materials science is an interdisciplinary field applying the properties of matter to various areas of science and engineering. This scientific field investigates the relationship between the structure of materials at atomic or molecular scales and their macroscopic properties. It incorporates elements of applied physics and chemistry. With significant media attention focused on nanoscience and nanotechnology in recent years, materials science has been propelled to the forefront at many universities. It is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis. Materials science also deals with fundamental properties and characteristics of materials.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Fullerene_Nanogears_-_GPN-2000-001535.jpg/200px-Fullerene_Nanogears_-_GPN-2000-001535.jpg
