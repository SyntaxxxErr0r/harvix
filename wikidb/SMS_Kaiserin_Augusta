2.00	SMS_Kaiserin_Augusta	SMS Kaiserin Augusta	SMS Kaiserin Augusta was a unique protected cruiser, built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the early 1890s. She was laid down in 1890, launched in January 1892, and completed in November of that year. Owing to budgetary restrictions, Kaiserin Augusta was designed to fill both fleet scout and colonial cruiser roles. The ship was initially armed with a main battery of four 15 cm (5.9 in) and eight 10.5 cm (4.1 in) guns, which by 1896 was replaced with twelve new model 15 cm guns. She was the first ship in the German Navy to feature a three-shaft propeller arrangement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/SMS_Kaiserin_Augusta_1_1893.jpg/300px-SMS_Kaiserin_Augusta_1_1893.jpg
