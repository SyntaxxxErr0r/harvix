80.5	Spiritualism	Spiritualism	Spiritualism is a belief system or religion, postulating the belief that spirits of the dead residing in the spirit world have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living. Anyone may receive spirit messages, but formal communication sessions are held by "mediums", who can then provide information about the afterlife.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Spirit_rappings_coverpage_to_sheet_music_1853.jpg/250px-Spirit_rappings_coverpage_to_sheet_music_1853.jpg
