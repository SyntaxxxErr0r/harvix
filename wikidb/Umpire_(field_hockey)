1.03	Umpire_(field_hockey)	Umpire (field hockey)	The role of the umpires is to control the match, apply the rules of hockey, uphold a duty of care to the players (keeping the game safe), be the judges of fair play and keep the flow. Each umpire has the primary responsibility for decisions in one half of the field, and is the only one allowed to award a Penalty Corner, Penalty Stroke or goal in their half of the field or a Free hit in their Shooting Circle (see diagram). However, they may consult with their colleague before making these decisions. They must also ensure that the correct amount of time is allowed for the match and record the scoring of goals and issuing of penalty cards to players. Similarly to football referees, most decisions are signalled using a whistle (and the use of the whistle is specifically instructed in the Rules), and the use of various hand signals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Hockey_field.svg/250px-Hockey_field.svg.png
