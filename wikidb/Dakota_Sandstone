It consists of sandy, shallow-marine deposits with intermittent mud flat sediments, and occasional stream deposits. It is an important aquifer in some areas of the Great Plains. It is frequently a porous sandstone and can reach thicknesses of more than 30 meters.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Dakota_Sandstone.jpg/300px-Dakota_Sandstone.jpg
