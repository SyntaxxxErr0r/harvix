127.6	Online_poker	Online poker	Online venues, by contrast, are dramatically cheaper because they have much smaller overhead costs. For example, adding another table does not take up valuable space like it would for a brick and mortar casino. Online poker rooms also allow the players to play for low stakes (as low as 1¢/2¢) and often offer poker freeroll tournaments (where there is no entry fee), attracting beginners and/or less wealthy clientele.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/PokerTableOpenSource.jpg/220px-PokerTableOpenSource.jpg
