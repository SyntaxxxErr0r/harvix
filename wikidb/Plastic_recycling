64.5	Plastic_recycling	Plastic recycling	Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastics and reprocessing the material into useful products, sometimes completely different in from their original state. For instance, this could mean melting down soft drink bottles and then casting them as plastic chairs and tables. Typically a plastic is not recycled into the same type of plastic, and products made from recycled plastics are often not recyclable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Bales_Crushed_PET_Bottles.JPG/250px-Bales_Crushed_PET_Bottles.JPG
