1.00	2001_ALCS	2001 American League Championship Series	The 2001 American League Championship Series was a rematch of the 2000 ALCS between the New York Yankees, who had come off a dramatic comeback against the Oakland Athletics in the Division Series after being down two games to zero, and the Seattle Mariners, who won an American League record 116 regular season games and had won their Division Series against the Cleveland Indians. The series had additional poignancy, coming immediately after downtown New York City was devastated by the events of September 11, 2001. (The series was played in late October due to Major League Baseball temporarily shutting down in the wake of the attacks).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/2001ALCS.jpg/175px-2001ALCS.jpg
