2.00	Cognitive_enhancer	Nootropic	Cognitive enhancers are drugs, supplements, nutraceuticals, and functional foods that enhance concentration and memory. Nootropics are cognitive enhancers that are neuroprotective or extremely nontoxic. Nootropics are by definition cognitive enhancers, but a cognitive enhancer is not necessarily a nootropic.
