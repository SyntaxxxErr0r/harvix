He gave up his membership of the Volksunie in 1977 after it acceded to a much-debated package of federal reforms. Vanhecke subsequently joined the Vlaams Nationale Partij, the predecessor of the Vlaams Blok.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Frank_Vanhecke.jpg/220px-Frank_Vanhecke.jpg
