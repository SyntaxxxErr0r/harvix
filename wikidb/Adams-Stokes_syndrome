4.41	Adams-Stokes_syndrome	Adams–Stokes syndrome	Stokes–Adams syndrome (alternative eponyms include Gerbec-Morgagni-Adams-Stokes syndrome) refers to a sudden, transient episode of syncope, occasionally featuring seizures. Named after two Irish physicians, Robert Adams (1791–1875) and William Stokes (1804–1877), the first description of the syndrome was published in 1717 by Slovene physician Marcus Gerbezius which was 44 years after its publication quoted by Giovanni Battista Morgagni.
