3.00	Peter_Eisenmann	Peter Eisenman	Peter Eisenman (born August 11, 1932 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American architect. Eisenman's professional work is often referred to as formalist, deconstructive, late avant-garde, late or high modernist, etc. A certain fragmenting of forms visible in some of Eisenman's projects has been identified as characteristic of an eclectic group of architects that were (self-)labeled as deconstructivists, and who were featured in an exhibition by the same name at the Museum of Modern Art. The heading also refers to the storied relationship and collaborations between Peter Eisenman and post-structuralist thinker Jacques Derrida.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/All_of_peter_eisenman.jpg/220px-All_of_peter_eisenman.jpg
