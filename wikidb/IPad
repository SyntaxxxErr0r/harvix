189.3	IPad	iPad	The iPad ( -pad) is a line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc., primarily as a platform for audio-visual media including books, periodicals, movies, music, games, apps and web content. Its size and weight fall between those of contemporary smartphones and laptop computers. The iPad runs on iOS, the same operating system used on Apple's iPod Touch and iPhone, and can run its own applications as well as iPhone applications. Without modification, the iPad will only run programs approved by Apple and distributed via the Apple App Store (with the exception of programs that run inside the iPad's web browser).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/1stGen-iPad-HomeScreen.jpg/220px-1stGen-iPad-HomeScreen.jpg
