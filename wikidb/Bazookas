1.00	Bazookas	Bazooka	Bazooka is the common name for a man-portable recoilless rocket antitank weapon, widely fielded by the U.S. Army. Also referred to as the "Stovepipe", the innovative bazooka was amongst the first-generation of rocket propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat. Featuring a solid rocket motor for propulsion, it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The universally-applied nickname arose from the M1 variant's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a "bazooka" invented and popularized by 1930s by U.S. comedian Bob Burns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Soldier_with_Bazooka_M1.jpg/300px-Soldier_with_Bazooka_M1.jpg
