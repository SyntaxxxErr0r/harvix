79.9	Mendelian_inheritance	Mendelian inheritance	Mendelian inheritance (or Mendelian genetics or Mendelism) is a scientific theory of how hereditary characteristics are passed from parent organisms to their offspring; it underlies much of genetics. This theoretical framework was initially derived from the work of Gregor Johann Mendel published in 1865 and 1866 which was re-discovered in 1900; it was initially very controversial. When Mendel's theories were integrated with the chromosome theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1915, they became the core of classical genetics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Mendelian_inheritance.svg/230px-Mendelian_inheritance.svg.png
