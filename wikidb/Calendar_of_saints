60.4	Calendar_of_saints	Calendar of saints	The calendar of saints is a traditional Christian method of organizing a liturgical year by associating each day with one or more saints and referring to the feast day of said saint. The system arose from the early Christian custom of annual commemoration of martyrs on the dates of their deaths, or birth into heaven, and is thus referred to in Latin as dies natalis ("day of birth"). In the Eastern Orthodox Church, it is called a Menologion. Menologion may also refer to a set of icons on which saints are depicted along the order of dates of their feasts, often made in two panels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Calendar_of_saints.jpg/250px-Calendar_of_saints.jpg
