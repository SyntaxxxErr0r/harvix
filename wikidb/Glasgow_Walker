1.00	Glasgow_Walker	Glasgow Walker	Glasgow Walker is a 2000 album by Scotland-based singer-songwriter John Martyn. It was his first album to be written on a keyboard rather than a guitar, after a suggestion from his friend Phil Collins. It contains a trip-hop song, "Cool In This Life", after John experimented with trip-hop on his earlier album And. Kathryn Williams is featured on backing vocals on "Can't Live Without" and "The Field of Play." The album was dedicated to Rod Woolnough.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/Glasgow_walker.jpg/220px-Glasgow_walker.jpg
