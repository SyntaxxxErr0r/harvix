56.0	Emperor	Emperor	An emperor (through Old French empereor from Latin imperator) is a (male) monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife or a woman who rules in her own right (empress regnant). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honor and rank than kings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Princely_Hat.svg/120px-Princely_Hat.svg.png
