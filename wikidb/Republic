134.8	Republic	Republic	A republic is a form of government in which the government is officially apportioned to the control of the people, or a significant portion of which, and where offices of state are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed. In modern times, a common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is NOT a monarch. The word republic is derived from the Latin phrase res publica, which can be translated as "the public affair", and often used to describe a state using this form of government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Republica_Romana.svg/200px-Republica_Romana.svg.png
