54.9	Chlorpromazine	Chlorpromazine	Chlorpromazine (as chlorpromazine hydrochloride, abbreviated CPZ; marketed in the United States as Thorazine and elsewhere as Largactil) is a typical antipsychotic. First synthesized on December 11, 1950, chlorpromazine was the first drug developed with specific antipsychotic action, and would serve as the prototype for the phenothiazine class of drugs, which later grew to comprise several other agents. The introduction of chlorpromazine into clinical use has been described as the single greatest advance in psychiatric care, dramatically improving the prognosis of patients in psychiatric hospitals worldwide ; the availability of antipsychotic drugs curtailed indiscriminate use of electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery , and was one of the driving forces behind the deinstitutionalization movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Chlorpromazine-2D-skeletal.png/220px-Chlorpromazine-2D-skeletal.png
