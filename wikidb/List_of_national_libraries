61.0	List_of_national_libraries	List of national and state libraries	A national library is specifically established by the government of a nation to serve as the pre-eminent repository of information for that country. Unlike public libraries, they rarely allow citizens to borrow books. Often, they include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works; such as the Gutenberg Bible. National libraries are usually notable for their size, compared to that of other libraries in the same country. Some national libraries may be thematic or specialized in some specific domains, beside or in replacement of the 'main' national library.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/LOC_-_Jefferson_building.jpg/250px-LOC_-_Jefferson_building.jpg
