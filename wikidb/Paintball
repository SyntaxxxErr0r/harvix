74.1	Paintball	Paintball	Paintball is a sport in which players compete, in teams or individually, to eliminate opponents by tagging them with capsules containing water soluble dye and gelatin shell outside (referred to as paintballs) propelled from a device called a paintball marker (commonly referred to as a paintball gun). Paintballs are composed of a non-toxic, biodegradable, water soluble mineral-oil. The game is regularly played at a sporting level with organized competition involving worldwide leagues, tournaments, professional teams, and players. Paintball technology is also used by military forces, law enforcement, para-military and security organizations to supplement military training, riot response, and non-lethal suppression of dangerous suspects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Paintballer.JPG/300px-Paintballer.JPG
