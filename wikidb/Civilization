98.8	Civilization	Civilization	Civilization is a sometimes controversial term that has been used in several related ways. Primarily, the term has been used to refer to the material and instrumental side of human cultures that are complex in terms of technology, science, and division of labor. Such civilizations are generally hierarchical and urbanized. In a classical context, people were called "civilized" to set them apart from Barbarians, while in a modern-day context, "civilized peoples" have been contrasted with primitive peoples.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Kairouan_Mosque_Stitched_Panorama.jpg/220px-Kairouan_Mosque_Stitched_Panorama.jpg
