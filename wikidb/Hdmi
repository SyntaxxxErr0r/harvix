A digital audio/video source for HDMI can include a HDMI-compliant set-top box, DVD player, HD DVD player, Blu-ray Disc player, AVCHD camcorder, personal computer (PCs), video game console (such as the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii U), AV receiver, tablet computer, and mobile phone. HDMI is a digital alternative to consumer analog standards, such as radio frequency (RF) coaxial cable, composite video, S-Video, SCART, component video, D-Terminal, or VGA (also called D-sub or DE-15F).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/HDMI_Connector_Pinout.svg/310px-HDMI_Connector_Pinout.svg.png
