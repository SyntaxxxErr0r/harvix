1.20	Teewinot_Mountain	Teewinot Mountain	Teewinot Mountain (12,325 feet (3,757 m)) is the sixth highest peak in the Teton Range, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming. The name of the mountain is derived from the Shoshone Native American word meaning "many pinnacles". The peak is northeast of the Grand Teton and the two are separated from one another by the Teton Glacier and Mount Owen. Teewinot Mountain rises more than 5,500 feet (1,700 m) above Jenny Lake. The 40 miles (64 km) long Teton Range is the youngest mountain chain in the Rocky Mountains, and began their uplift 9 million years ago, during the Miocene. Several periods of glaciation have carved Teewinot Mountain and the other peaks of the range into their current shapes. Along with a number of other high peaks in the central Teton Range, Teewinot is part of what is known as the Cathedral Group, due to the similarity of the peaks to the spires of a cathedral.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Teewinot_Grand_Teton_GTNP4.jpg/280px-Teewinot_Grand_Teton_GTNP4.jpg
