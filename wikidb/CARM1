2.00	CARM1	CARM1	CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) is an enzyme encoded by the CARM1 gene found in human beings, as well as many other mammals. It has a polypeptide (L) chain type that is 348 residues long, and is made up of alpha helices and beta sheets. Its main function includes catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the side chain nitrogens of arginine residues within proteins to form methylated arginine derivatives and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. CARM1 is a secondary coactivator through its association with p160 family (SRC-1, GRIP1, AIB) of coactivators. It is responsible for moving cells toward the inner cell mass in developing blastocysts. This gene also plays an important role in androgen receptors and may play a role in prostate cancer progression.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/PDB1.png/220px-PDB1.png
