168.7	Liberation_Tigers_of_Tamil_Eelam	Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam	The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was a separatist militant organization formerly based in northern Sri Lanka. Founded in May 1976 by Vellupillai Prabhakaran, it waged a violent secessionist and nationalist campaign to create an independent state in the north and east of Sri Lanka for Tamil People. This campaign evolved into the Sri Lankan Civil War, which ran from 1983 until 2009, when the LTTE was defeated by the Sri Lankan Military.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a6/Ltte_emblem.jpg
