2.11	Gay_Street_(Baltimore)	Gay Street (Baltimore)	Gay Street is a street in Baltimore, Maryland that gets its name from Nicholas Ruxton Gay, who surveyed the area in 1747. It begins at the intersection of East Pratt Street near the Baltimore World Trade Center (at the Inner Harbor) and proceeds north and east through Baltimore until it crosses Orleans Street and becomes Ensor Street. According to the Baltimore City web site, the Gay Street corridor escaped the Great Baltimore Fire in 1904.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Gay_Street_Looking_Northeast%2C_Baltimore%2C_MD.jpg/200px-Gay_Street_Looking_Northeast%2C_Baltimore%2C_MD.jpg
