4.00	Scissor	Scissors	Scissors are hand-operated cutting instruments. They consist of a pair of metal blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the handles (bows) opposite to the pivot are closed. Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, thin plastic, cloth, rope, and wire. Scissors can also be used to cut hair and food. Scissors and shears are functionally equivalent, but larger implements tend to be called shears.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Skalm_2.JPG/220px-Skalm_2.JPG
