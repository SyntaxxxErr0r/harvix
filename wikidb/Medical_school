54.9	Medical_school	Medical school	A medical school is a tertiary educational institution—or part of such an institution—that teaches medicine. Degree programs offered at medical schools often include Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, Bachelor/Doctor of Medicine, Doctor of Philosophy, Master's degree, or other post-secondary education. Many medical schools also offer a physician assistant/associate program. Medical schools can also employ medical researchers and operate hospitals. The entry criteria, structure, teaching methodology, and nature of medical programs offered at medical schools vary considerably around the world. Medical schools are often highly competitive, using standardized entrance examinations to narrow the selection criteria for candidates.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/John_Morgan_Building_of_the_Perelman_School_of_Medicine.jpg/275px-John_Morgan_Building_of_the_Perelman_School_of_Medicine.jpg
