74.0	Ball_lightning	Ball lightning	Ball lightning is an unexplained atmospheric electrical phenomenon. The term refers to reports of luminous, usually spherical objects which vary from pea-sized to several metres in diameter. It is usually associated with thunderstorms, but lasts considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightning bolt. Many of the early reports say that the ball eventually explodes, sometimes with fatal consequences, leaving behind the odour of sulfur.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Ball_lightning.png/220px-Ball_lightning.png
