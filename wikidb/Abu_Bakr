62.7	Abu_Bakr	Abu Bakr	Abu Bakr (Abdullah ibn Abi Quhafa) and the father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He ruled over the Rashidun Caliphate from 632â€“634 CE when he became the first Muslim Caliph following Muhammad's death. As Caliph, Abu Bakr succeeded to the political and administrative functions previously exercised by Muhammad, since the religious function and authority of prophethood ended with Muhammad's death according to Islam. He was called Al-Siddiq (The Truthful) and was known by that title among later generations of Muslims.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Allah-eser-green.png/180px-Allah-eser-green.png
