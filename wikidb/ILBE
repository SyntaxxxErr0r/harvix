2.02	ILBE	Improved Load Bearing Equipment	The Improved Load Bearing Equipment or ILBE is a United States Marine Corps program that includes individual load carriage equipment, individual hydration systems and individual water purification. Since the rucksack was the first part of the program issued to Marines, the ruck is commonly referred to as simply "ILBE". The ILBE ruck was designed to replace the existing ALICE and MOLLE packs. The ILBE is designed by Arc'teryx's Law Enforcement and Armed Forces "LEAF" program and manufactured by Propper Inc. The backpack is made from Cordura 725 denier fabric, with MARPAT camouflage pattern printed onto it. The pack is also covered with a PALS grid, for the attachment of smaller modular pouches. It includes a main pack, a detachable assault pack and a 100-ounce (3 liter) water reservoir. The ILBE can hold up to 120 pounds and has room for 60mm and 81mm mortar rounds outside the main pack. Specialized bags for corpsmen and reconnaissance units are also available.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/US_Marines_Talisman_Saber_07.jpg/200px-US_Marines_Talisman_Saber_07.jpg
