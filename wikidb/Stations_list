6.01	Stations_list	Stations of the Exodus	The Bible lists 42 locations or "stations" visited by the Israelites following their exodus from Egypt. They are definitively listed in Numbers 33, but also are given at length in Exodus and Deuteronomy. Biblical commentators like St Jerome in his Epistle to Fabiola, Bede and St Peter Damian discussed them according to the Hebrew meanings of their names. Dante models the 42 chapters of the Vita Nuova on them.
