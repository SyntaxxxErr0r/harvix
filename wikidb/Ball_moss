8.11	Ball_moss	Tillandsia recurvata	Tillandsia recurvata, commonly known as Ball Moss, is a flowering plant (not a true moss) that grows upon larger host plants. It grows well in areas with low light, little airflow, and high humidity, which is commonly provided by southern shade trees, often the Southern Live Oak . It is not a parasite like mistletoe, but an epiphyte like its relative Spanish moss. It derives only physical support and not nutrition from its host, photosynthesizing its own food, receiving water vapor from the air, and obtaining nitrogen from bacteria. Ball Moss may hinder tree growth by competing for sunlight and some nutrients and by restricting available surface area for new branch sprouts from the host tree; except in stressed trees (e.g., urban settings with air pollution) it usually does not unduly affect healthy specimens. It tends to form a spheroid shape ranging in size from a golf ball to a soccer ball. Most Ball Moss seedlings begin on tiny branches and less often on vertical bark of tree hosts, an indication that local spread of Ball Moss is mainly by seeds sprouting from bird droppings on stems of shrubs and trees. Wind is said by one authority to be the main agent of seed dispersal. Ball Moss is sensitive to freezing, particularly when moist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Tillandsia_recurvata.jpg/220px-Tillandsia_recurvata.jpg
