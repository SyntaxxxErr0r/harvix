118.5	Likert_scale	Likert scale	An important distinction must be made between a Likert scale and a Likert item. The Likert scale is the sum of responses on several Likert items. Because Likert items are often accompanied by a visual analog scale (e.g., a horizontal line, on which a subject indicates his or her response by circling or checking tick-marks), the items are sometimes called scales themselves. This is the source of much confusion; it is better, therefore, to reserve the term Likert scale to apply to the summed scale, and Likert item to refer to an individual item.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Example_Likert_Scale.svg/220px-Example_Likert_Scale.svg.png
