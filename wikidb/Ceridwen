26.63	Ceridwen	Ceridwen	In Welsh medieval legend, Ceridwen ( -id-w…ôn), also spelled Cerridwen, was an enchantress, mother of Morfran and a beautiful daughter Creirwy. Her husband was Tegid Foel, and they lived near Bala Lake in north Wales. Medieval Welsh poetry refers to her as possessing the cauldron of Poetic Inspiration (Awen) and the Tale of Taliesin recounts her swallowing her servant Gwion Bach who is then reborn through her as the poet Taliesin. Ceridwen is regarded by modern Wiccans as the Celtic goddess of rebirth, transformation, and inspiration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Ceridwen.jpg/220px-Ceridwen.jpg
