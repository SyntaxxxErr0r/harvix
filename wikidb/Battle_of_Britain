71.5	Battle_of_Britain	Battle of Britain	The Battle of Britain (German: Luftschlacht um England or Luftschlacht um Gro√übritannien, literally "Air battle for England" or "Air battle for Great Britain") is the name given to the World War II air campaign waged by the German Air Force against the United Kingdom during the summer and autumn of 1940. The objective of the campaign was to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF), especially Fighter Command. The name derives from a famous speech delivered by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the House of Commons: "...the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Battle_of_britain_air_observer.jpg/300px-Battle_of_britain_air_observer.jpg
