20.63	Metal_clay	Metal clay	Metal clay is a crafting medium consisting of very small particles of metal such as silver, gold, or copper mixed with an organic binder and water for use in making jewelry, beads and small sculptures. Originating in Japan in 1990, metal clay can be shaped just like any soft clay, by hand or using molds. After drying, the clay can be fired in a variety of ways such as in a kiln, with a handheld gas torch, or on a gas stove. The binder burns away, leaving the pure sintered metal. Shrinkage of between 8% and 30% occurs (depending on the product used). Alloys such as bronze, sterling silver, and steel also are available.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/MetalClayPendant.jpg/220px-MetalClayPendant.jpg
