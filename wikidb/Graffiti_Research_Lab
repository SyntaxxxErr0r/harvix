18.76	Graffiti_Research_Lab	Graffiti Research Lab	Graffiti Research Lab, founded by Evan Roth and James Powderly during their fellowships at the Eyebeam OpenLab, is an art group dedicated to outfitting graffiti writers, artists and protesters with open source technologies for urban communication. The members of the group experiment in a lab and in the field to develop and test a range of experimental technologies. They document those efforts with video documentation and DIY instructions for each project and make it available for everybody. The GRL is particularly well-known for inventing LED Throwies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/LED_throwies_chaos.jpg/220px-LED_throwies_chaos.jpg
