375.2	Comma-separated_values	Comma-separated values	A comma-separated values file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form. Plain text means that the file is a sequence of characters, with no data that has to be interpreted instead, as binary numbers. A CSV file consists of any number of records, separated by line breaks of some kind; each record consists of fields, separated by some other character or string, most commonly a literal TAB or comma. Usually, all records have an identical sequence of fields.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/CsvDelimited001.svg/200px-CsvDelimited001.svg.png
