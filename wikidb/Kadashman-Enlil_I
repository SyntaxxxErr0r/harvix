3.00	Kadashman-Enlil_I	Kadashman-Enlil I	Kadašman-Enlil I, typically rendered mka-dáš-man-dEN.LÍL in contemporary inscriptions (with the archaic masculine determinative preceeding his name), was a Kassite King of Babylon from ca. 1374 BC to 1360 BC , perhaps the 18th of the dynasty. He is known to have been a contemporary of Amenhotep III of Egypt, with whom he corresponded. This places Kadašman-Enlil securely to the first half of the 14th century BC by most standard chronologies.
