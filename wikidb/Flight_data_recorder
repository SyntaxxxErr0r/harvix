62.3	Flight_data_recorder	Flight data recorder	A flight data recorder (also ADR, for accident data recorder) is an electronic device employed to record any instructions sent to any electronic systems on an aircraft. It is a device used to record specific aircraft performance parameters. Another kind of flight recorder is the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which records conversation in the cockpit, radio communications between the cockpit crew and others (including conversation with air traffic control personnel), as well as ambient sounds. In this both functions have been combined into a single unit. The current applicable FAA TSO is C124b titled Flight Data Recorder Systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Fdr_sidefront.jpg/220px-Fdr_sidefront.jpg
