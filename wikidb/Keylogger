62.3	Keylogger	Keystroke logging	Keystroke logging (often called keylogging) is the action of tracking (or logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. There are numerous keylogging methods, ranging from hardware and software-based approaches to electromagnetic and acoustic analysis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Keylogger-software-logfile-example.jpg/175px-Keylogger-software-logfile-example.jpg
