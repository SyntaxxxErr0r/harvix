133.4	Ozone_depletion	Ozone depletion	Ozone depletion describes two distinct but related phenomena observed since the late 1970s: a steady decline of about 4% per decade in the total volume of ozone in Earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone over Earth's polar regions. The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole. In addition to these well-known stratospheric phenomena, there are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/160658main2_OZONE_large_350.png/220px-160658main2_OZONE_large_350.png
