103.7	Gout	Gout	Gout (also known as podagra when it involves the big toe) is a medical condition usually characterized by recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritisâ€”a red, tender, hot, swollen joint. The metatarsal-phalangeal joint at the base of the big toe is the most commonly affected (approximately 50% of cases). However, it may also present as tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy. It is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood which crystallizes and the crystals are deposited in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/The_gout_james_gillray.jpg/230px-The_gout_james_gillray.jpg
