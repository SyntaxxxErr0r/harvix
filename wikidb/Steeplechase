18.61	Steeplechase	Steeplechase	The steeplechase is a form of horse racing (primarily conducted in the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Australia, France, and Ireland) and derives its name from early races in which orientation of the course was by reference to a church steeple, jumping fences and ditches and generally traversing the many intervening obstacles in the countryside. In Great Britain and Ireland the official term now used for the sport is National Hunt racing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Steeplechase_%281257926029%29.jpg/300px-Steeplechase_%281257926029%29.jpg
