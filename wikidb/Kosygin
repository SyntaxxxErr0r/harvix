2.10	Kosygin	Alexei Kosygin	Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin , Kosygin was a member of the State Defence Committee and was tasked with moving Soviet industry out of territories soon to be overrun by the German military. He served as Minister of Finance for a year before becoming Minister of Light Industry and later, the Minister of Light and Food Industry. One year before his death in 1953, Stalin removed Kosygin from the Politburo, intentionally weakening his position within the Soviet hierarchy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/A._Kosygin_1967.jpg/220px-A._Kosygin_1967.jpg
