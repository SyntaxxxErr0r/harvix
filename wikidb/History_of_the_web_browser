In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. These are the two major milestones in the history of the Web.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/First_Web_Server.jpg/250px-First_Web_Server.jpg
