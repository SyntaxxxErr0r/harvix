1.01	Gn%C3%A1_and_H%C3%B3fvarpnir	Gná and Hófvarpnir	In Norse mythology, Gná is a goddess who runs errands in other worlds for the goddess Frigg and rides the flying, sea-treading horse Hófvarpnir . Gná and Hófvarpnir are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholarly theories have been proposed about Gná as a "goddess of fullness" and as potentially cognate to Fama from Roman mythology. Hófvarpnir and the eight-legged steed Sleipnir have been cited examples of transcendent horses in Norse mythology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Frigg_by_Doepler.jpg/220px-Frigg_by_Doepler.jpg
