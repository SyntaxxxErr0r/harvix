The diamond's origins are in South Africa, where it was bought by the jeweler Julius Cohen as a 198.28 carat (39.656 g) rough in 1963. After buying it, Cohen returned to New York where he had it cut into its distinctive pear shape by S&amp;M Kaufman. Because of its colouring similarities to the brown chrysanthemum, it was named after that flower.
