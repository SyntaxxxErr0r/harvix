71.6	Purple_Heart	Purple Heart	The Purple Heart is a United States military decoration awarded in the name of the President to those who have been wounded or killed while serving on or after April 5, 1917 with the U.S. military. The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York. With its forerunner, the Badge of Military Merit, which took the form of a heart made of purple cloth, the Purple Heart is the oldest award that is still given to members of the U.S. military, the only earlier award being the obsolete Fidelity Medallion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Purpleheart.jpg/150px-Purpleheart.jpg
