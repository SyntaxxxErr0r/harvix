77.1	Clonazepam	Clonazepam	Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine drug having anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and hypnotic properties. It is marketed by Roche under the trade name Klonopin in the United States and Rivotril in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the European Union (and in countries like Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia and Montenegro). Other names such as Ravotril, Rivatril, Clonex, Paxam, or Kriadex are known throughout the rest of the world. Clonazepam has an unusually long elimination half-life of 18â€“50 hours, making it generally considered to be among the long-acting benzodiazepines. Clonazepam is a chlorinated derivative of nitrazepam and therefore a chloro-nitrobenzodiazepine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Clonazepam_structure.svg/220px-Clonazepam_structure.svg.png
