1.00	Invader_Zim_DVD_collection	Invader Zim merchandise	The first series of Invader Zim figures was released in the fall of 2004, Series one contains alien Zim, undisguised GIR (with the Voot Carrier in its pig disguise from Attack of the Saucer Morons), Dib, Ms. Bitters, and Almighty Tallest Purple. Hot Topic variations of series one included Duty Mode Gir, screaming Zim, sneering Almighty Tallest Purple, frustrated Dib, and snarling Ms. Bitters. The Zim figure fits in the cockpit of the Voot Carrier, and the GIR figure can attach to some pegs behind the cockpit, so one could recreate the "Ride the Pig" scene from Attack of the Saucer Morons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Invader_Zim_Toys_S1.jpg
