1.00	The_Good_Friday_Agreement	Good Friday Agreement	The Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement , sometimes called the Stormont Agreement, was a major political development in the Northern Ireland peace process. The Agreement was made up of two inter-related documents, both signed in Belfast on 10 April 1998 (Good Friday): a multi-party agreement by most of Northern Ireland's political parties, and an international agreement between the British and Irish governments. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was the only major political group in Northern Ireland to oppose the Agreement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Politicsofnorthernirelandlogo.svg/165px-Politicsofnorthernirelandlogo.svg.png
