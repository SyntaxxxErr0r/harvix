1.00	Airborne_tactical_laser	Advanced Tactical Laser	The Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) program is a US military program to mount a high energy laser weapon on an aircraft, initially the AC-130 gunship, for use against ground targets in urban or other areas where minimizing collateral damage is important. The laser will be a 100 kilowatt-class chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL). It is expected to have a tactical range of approximately twenty kilometers and weigh about 5,000â€“7,000 kg. This program is distinct from the Airborne Laser, which is a much larger system designed to destroy enemy missiles in the boost phase.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Airborne-laser.jpg/220px-Airborne-laser.jpg
