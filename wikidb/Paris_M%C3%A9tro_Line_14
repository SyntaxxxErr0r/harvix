18.20	Paris_M%C3%A9tro_Line_14	Paris Métro Line 14	Line 14 of the Paris Métro system connects the stations Saint Lazare and Olympiades on a north-west south-east diagonal across the centre of Paris. It is the twelfth busiest of sixteen lines on the network, and as of 2011, the only one to be operated completely automatically; the second such line in the Île-de-France after Orlyval. Before being put into commercial service it was known as project Météor, an acronym of MÉTro Est-Ouest Rapide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Paris_Metro_St_Lazare.jpg/220px-Paris_Metro_St_Lazare.jpg
