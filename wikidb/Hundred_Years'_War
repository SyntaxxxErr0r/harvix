77.0	Hundred_Years'_War	Hundred Years' War	The Hundred Years' War was a series of separate conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France and their various allies for control of the French throne, which had become vacant upon the extinction of the senior Capetian line of French kings. The House of Valois controlled France in the wake of the House of Capet; a Capetian cadet branch, the Valois claimed the throne under Salic Law. This was contested by the House of Plantagenet, the Angevin family that had ruled England since 1154, who claimed the throne of France through the marriage of Edward II of England and Isabella of France.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Hundred_Years%27_War_montage.jpg/300px-Hundred_Years%27_War_montage.jpg
