12.30	Hittite_mythology	Hittite mythology	Most of the narratives embodying Hittite mythology are lost, and the elements that would give a balanced view of Hittite religion are lacking among the tablets recovered at the Hittite capital Hattusa and other Hittite sites: "there are no canonical scriptures, no theological disquisitions or discourses, no aids to private devotion". Some religious documents formed part of the corpus with which young scribes were trained, and have survived, most of them dating from the last several decades before the final burning of the sites. The scribes in the royal administration, some of whose archives survive, were a bureaucracy, organizing and maintaining royal responsibilities in areas that would be considered part of religion today: temple organization, cultic administration, reports of diviners, make up the main body of surviving texts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/HittiteSeatedDeityAnatolia13thCenturyBCE.jpg/220px-HittiteSeatedDeityAnatolia13thCenturyBCE.jpg
