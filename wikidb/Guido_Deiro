6.12	Guido_Deiro	Guido Deiro	Count Guido Pietro Deiro (September 1, 1886 - July 26, 1950) was a famous vaudeville star, international recording artist, composer and teacher. He was the first piano-accordionist to appear on big-time vaudeville, records, radio and the screen. Guido usually performed under the stage-name "Deiro". Guido and his younger brother Pietro Deiro (known as "Pietro") were among the highest paid musicians on the vaudeville circuit, and they both did much to introduce and popularize the piano accordion in the early 20th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/GuidoDeiro1909.jpg/200px-GuidoDeiro1909.jpg
