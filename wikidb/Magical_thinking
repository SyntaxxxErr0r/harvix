103.5	Magical_thinking	Magical thinking	Magical thinking is causal reasoning that looks for correlation between acts or utterances and certain events. In religion, folk religion, and superstition, the correlation posited is between religious ritual, such as prayer, sacrifice, or the observance of a taboo, and an expected benefit or recompense. In clinical psychology, magical thinking is a condition that causes the patient to experience irrational fear of performing certain acts or having certain thoughts because they assume a correlation with their acts and threatening calamities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Laying_on_of_hands.jpg/400px-Laying_on_of_hands.jpg
