4.42	Ore_genesis	Ore genesis	Iron ores are overwhelmingly derived from ancient sediments known as banded iron formations (BIFs). These sediments are composed of iron oxide minerals deposited on the sea floor. Particular environmental conditions are needed to transport enough iron in sea water to form these deposits, such as acidic and oxygen-poor atmospheres within the Proterozoic Era.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Citrobacter_freundii.jpg/220px-Citrobacter_freundii.jpg
