59.7	Embryonic_stem_cell	Embryonic stem cell	Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, an early-stage embryo. Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4–5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. Isolating the embryoblast or inner cell mass (ICM) results in destruction of the fertilized human embryo, which raises ethical issues.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Humanstemcell.JPG/300px-Humanstemcell.JPG
