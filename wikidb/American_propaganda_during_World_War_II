Using a wide variety of media, propagandists fomented hatred for the enemy and support for America's allies, urged greater public effort for war production and victory gardens, persuaded people to make do with what they had so that more material could be used for the war effort, and sold war bonds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/In_the_face_of_obstacles_-_Courage_poster.jpg/240px-In_the_face_of_obstacles_-_Courage_poster.jpg
