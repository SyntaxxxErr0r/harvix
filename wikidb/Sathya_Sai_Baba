90.4	Sathya_Sai_Baba	Sathya Sai Baba	Åšri Sathya Sai Baba was an Indian guru, spiritual figure, mystic, philanthropist and educator. He claimed to be the reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi, considered a spiritual saint and a reputed miracle worker, who died in 1918 and whose teachings were an eclectic blend of Hindu and Muslim beliefs. The materializations of vibhuti (holy ash) and other small objects such as rings, necklaces and watches by Sathya Sai Baba were a source of both fame and controversy; devotees considered them signs of divinity, while skeptics viewed them as simple conjuring tricks. Photos of him are displayed in millions of homes and on the dashboards of cars, and lockets bearing his photo are worn by many as a symbol of good fortune.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Sathyasaibabafloat1946.jpg/220px-Sathyasaibabafloat1946.jpg
