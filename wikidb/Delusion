58.1	Delusion	Delusion	A delusion is a belief held with strong conviction despite superior evidence to the contrary. Unlike hallucinations, delusions are always pathological (the result of an illness or illness process). As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, dogma, poor memory, illusion, or other effects of perception.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Airloom.gif/220px-Airloom.gif
