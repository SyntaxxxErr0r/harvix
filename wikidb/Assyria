82.1	Assyria	Assyria	Assyria was a Semitic Akkadian kingdom, extant as a nation state from the late 25th or earlyâ€“24th century BC to 608 BC centred on the Upper Tigris river, in northern Mesopotamia (present day northern Iraq), that came to rule regional empires a number of times through history. It was named for its original capital, the ancient city of Assur . Assyria was also sometimes known as Subartu, and after its fall, from 605 BC through to the late seventh century AD variously as Athura, Syria (Greek), Assyria (Latin) and Assuristan. The term Assyria can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where Assyria, its empires and the Assyrian people were centred. The modern Assyrian Christian minority in northern Iraq, north east Syria, south east Turkey and north west Iran are thought to be the descendants of the ancient Assyrians (see Assyrian continuity).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Iraq_state_emblem_CoA_1959-1965_Qassem.svg/100px-Iraq_state_emblem_CoA_1959-1965_Qassem.svg.png
