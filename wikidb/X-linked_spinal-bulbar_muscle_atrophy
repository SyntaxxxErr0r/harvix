2.00	X-linked_spinal-bulbar_muscle_atrophy	Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy	Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also called spinobulbar muscular atrophy, X-linked bulbo-spinal atrophy, X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMAX1) or Kennedy's disease (KD) â€” is an X-linked recessive, slow progressing, neurodegenerative disease associated with mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). Because of its endocrine manifestations related to the impairment of the AR, it can be viewed as a variation of the disorders of the androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). It is also related to other neurodegenerative diseases caused by similar mutations, such as Huntington's disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias. Kennedy's disease is named after W. R. Kennedy, a neurologist who was among the first to describe this disease.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/XlinkRecessive.jpg/220px-XlinkRecessive.jpg
