126.5	Battle_of_Waterloo	Battle of Waterloo	Upon Napoleon's return to power in 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Two large forces under Wellington and Blücher assembled close to the north-eastern border of France. Napoleon chose to attack in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. The decisive engagement of this three-day Waterloo Campaign (16–19 June 1815) occurred at the Battle of Waterloo. According to Wellington, the battle was "the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Battle_of_Waterloo_1815.PNG/300px-Battle_of_Waterloo_1815.PNG
