51.3	Elizabeth_I	Elizabeth I of England	Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 â€“ 24 March 1603) was queen regnant of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death. Sometimes called The Virgin Queen, Gloriana, or Good Queen Bess, Elizabeth was the fifth and last monarch of the Tudor dynasty. The daughter of Henry VIII, she was born a princess, but her mother, Anne Boleyn, was executed two and a half years after her birth, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Her half-brother, Edward VI, bequeathed the crown to Lady Jane Grey, cutting his half-sisters out of the succession. His will was set aside, Lady Jane Grey was executed, and in 1558 Elizabeth succeeded the Catholic Mary I, during whose reign she had been imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Autograph_of_Elizabeth_I_of_England.svg/125px-Autograph_of_Elizabeth_I_of_England.svg.png
