It was the first season the Patriots played in Schaeffer Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts after playing in three different stadiums the previous three seasons in Boston. It was the first season after the Patriots changed its name from the Boston Patriots to the New England Patriots in a move to regionalize the franchise and represent the six New England states.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/AFC-1971-Uniform-NE.PNG/275px-AFC-1971-Uniform-NE.PNG
