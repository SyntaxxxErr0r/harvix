1.01	Maserati_Spyder	Maserati Coupé	The Maserati Coupé and Spyder are grand tourers produced by Italian automaker Maserati from 2001 to 2007. They have now been replaced by the GranTurismo. The two nameplates refer to the four-seater coupé and two-seater roadster versions, respectively. Both models were based on the 3200 GT, which was sold in Europe, but not in the United States. The Coupé and Spyder are both commonly referred to as the 4200 GT, which is an evolution of the prior model name and a reference to the increase in engine displacement from 3.2 L (3217 cc) to 4.2 L (4244 cc).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/2004MaseratiSpyder.jpg/250px-2004MaseratiSpyder.jpg
