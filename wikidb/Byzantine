51.1	Byzantine	Byzantine Empire	The Byzantine Empire (or Byzantium) was the Eastern Roman Empire during the periods of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, centered on the capital of Constantinople. Known simply as the "Roman Empire" (Greek: , Basileia Rhōmaiōn; Latin: ) or Romania () to its inhabitants and neighbours, it was the direct continuation of the Ancient Roman State and maintained Roman state traditions. Byzantium is today distinguished from ancient Rome proper insofar as it was oriented towards Greek culture, characterised by Christianity rather than Roman paganism and was predominantly Greek-speaking rather than Latin-speaking.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Justinian550AD.png/250px-Justinian550AD.png
