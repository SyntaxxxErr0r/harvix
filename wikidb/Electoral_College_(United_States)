57.7	Electoral_College_(United_States)	Electoral College (United States)	The Electoral College consists of the electors appointed by each state who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Since 1964, there have been 538 electors in each presidential election. Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have and that each state's legislature decides how its electors are to be chosen. U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an example of an indirect election, as opposed to a direct election by United States citizens (such as for members of the United States House of Representatives).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/ElectoralCollege2012.svg/350px-ElectoralCollege2012.svg.png
