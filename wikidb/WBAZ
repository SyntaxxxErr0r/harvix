1.00	WBAZ	WBAZ	WBAZ is the callsign of an adult contemporary radio station licensed to Bridgehampton, New York and serving the east end of Long Island and southeastern Connecticut. The station is owned by Long Island Radio Broadcasting (a division of Cherry Creek Radio) and broadcasts on 102.5 MHz with 6 kilowatts ERP from a tower in Southampton. It is not to be confused with long-defunct Top 40 WBAZ-AM 1550, which served the upstate city of Kingston during the 1950s from a tower on Sawkill Road.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/WBAZ-studio.jpg/250px-WBAZ-studio.jpg
