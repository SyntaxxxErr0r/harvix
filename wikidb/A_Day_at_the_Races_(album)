It was the band's first completely self-produced album, and the first not to feature producer Roy Thomas Baker. Recorded at Sarm East, The Manor and Wessex Studios in England, A Day at the Races was engineered by Mike Stone. The title of the album followed suit with its predecessor A Night at the Opera in taking its name from a film by the Marx Brothers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/31/A_Day_at_the_Races_%28Queen%29.jpg/220px-A_Day_at_the_Races_%28Queen%29.jpg
