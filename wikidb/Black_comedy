56.02	Black_comedy	Black comedy	A black comedy, or dark comedy, is a comic work that employs black humor or gallows humor. The definition of black humor is problematic; it has been argued that it corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor; and that, as humor has been defined since Freud as a comedic act that anesthetizes an emotion, all humor is "black humor", and that there is no such thing as "non-black humor".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Hopscotch_to_oblivion.jpg/220px-Hopscotch_to_oblivion.jpg
