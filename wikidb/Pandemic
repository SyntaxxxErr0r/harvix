80.8	Pandemic	Pandemic	A pandemic (from Greek πᾶν pan "all" + δῆμος demos "people") is an epidemic of infectious disease that is spreading through human populations across a large region; for instance multiple continents, or even worldwide. A widespread endemic disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, flu pandemics generally exclude recurrences of seasonal flu. Throughout history there have been a number of pandemics, such as smallpox and tuberculosis. More recent pandemics include the HIV pandemic and the H1n1 pandemic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/1918FluVictimsStLouis.jpg/220px-1918FluVictimsStLouis.jpg
