82.8	Charles_Baudelaire	Charles Baudelaire	Charles Pierre Baudelaire , expresses the changing nature of beauty in modern, industrializing Paris during the 19th century. Baudelaire's highly original style of prose-poetry influenced a whole generation of poets including Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud and Stéphane Mallarmé among many others. He is credited with coining the term "modernity" (modernité) to designate the fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, and the responsibility art has to capture that experience.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Baudelaire_crop.jpg/220px-Baudelaire_crop.jpg
