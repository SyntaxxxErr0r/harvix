It is noted for the three ghost moves that were allegedly given to Jowa during the game by ghosts, and for the premature death of the go prodigy Intetsu Akaboshi who died soon after coughing up blood onto the board after the game. Selected moves of the game are shown in diagrams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Go_board_part.jpg
