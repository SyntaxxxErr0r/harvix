100.3	Cornell_University	Cornell University	Cornell University ( ) is an Ivy League university located in Ithaca, New York, United States. It is a private land-grant university, receiving annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledgeâ€”from the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bc/Cornell_Seal.svg/226px-Cornell_Seal.svg.png
