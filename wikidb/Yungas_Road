51.3	Yungas_Road	Yungas Road	The North Yungas Road (alternatively known as Grove's Road, Coroico Road, , , Road of Death or Death Road) is a 61-kilometre (38 mi) or 69-kilometre (43 mi) road leading from La Paz to Coroico, 56 kilometres (35 mi) northeast of La Paz in the Yungas region of Bolivia. It is legendary for its extreme danger and in 1995 the Inter-American Development Bank christened it as the "world's most dangerous road". One estimate is that 200 to 300 travellers are killed yearly along the road. The road includes crosses marking many of the spots where vehicles have fallen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Bolivia_Yunga_Road.jpg/200px-Bolivia_Yunga_Road.jpg
