7.73	Chambered_Nautilus	Chambered Nautilus	The Chambered Nautilus, Nautilus pompilius, is the best-known species of nautilus. The shell, when cut away reveals a lining of lustrous nacre and displays a nearly perfect equiangular spiral, although it is not a golden spiral. The shell exhibits countershading, being light on the bottom and dark on top. This is to help avoid predators because when seen from above, it blends in with the darkness of the sea, and when seen from below, it blends in with the light coming from above.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Nautilus-JB-01.jpg/220px-Nautilus-JB-01.jpg
