2.00	Autozygosity	Zygosity	As discussed above, "zygosity" can be used in the context of a specific genetic locus (example). In addition, the word "zygosity" may also be used to describe the genetic similarity or dissimilarity of twins. Identical twins are monozygotic, meaning that they develop from one zygote that splits and forms two embryos. Fraternal twins are dizygotic because they develop from two separate eggs that are fertilized by two separate sperm.
