64.0	In-N-Out_Burger	In-N-Out Burger	In-N-Out Burger is a regional chain of fast food restaurants with locations in the western United States. Founded in 1948 by Harry Snyder and his wife Esther, establishing the first In-N-Out burger in Baldwin Park and headquartered in Irvine, California, In-N-Out Burger has since expanded outside Southern California to the rest of the state, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Texas. The current owner is Lynsi Martinez, the only grandchild of founders Harry and Esther Snyder. There are currently 268 locations (as of January 2012) with no location more than one day's drive from a regional distribution center. As the chain has expanded they have opened several distribution centers in addition to their original Baldwin Park location. These new distribution centers, located in Arizona , Utah (Draper), and Texas (Dallas) will provide for potential future expansion to other parts of the country. The company's business practices have been noted for employee-centered personnel policies. For example, In-N-Out is one of the few fast food chains in the United States to pay its employees significantly more than state and federally mandated minimum wage guidelines â€“ starting at $10 per hour in California, as of January 2008.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/InNOut.svg/150px-InNOut.svg.png
