6.10	Nas_Is_Like	Nas Is Like	"Nas Is Like" is the first single from Nas' third album I Am.... The song is the sixth collaboration between Nas and producer DJ Premier. It was critically well received as it was a change from the more commercial and pop-oriented singles from It Was Written and Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album. The song contains a combination of braggadocios and introspective lyrics over a choppy string sample.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Nas_is_like.jpg/220px-Nas_is_like.jpg
