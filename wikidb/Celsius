133.6	Celsius	Celsius	Celsius, formerly known as centigrade, is a scale and unit of measurement for temperature. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), who developed a similar temperature scale two years before his death. The degree Celsius (°C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. The unit was known until 1948 as "centigrade" from the Latin centum translated as 100 and gradus translated as "steps".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Thermometer.JPG/220px-Thermometer.JPG
