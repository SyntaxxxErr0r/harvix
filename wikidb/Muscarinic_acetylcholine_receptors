2.00	Muscarinic_acetylcholine_receptors	Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor	Muscarinic receptors, or mAChRs, are acetylcholine receptors that form G protein-coupled in the plasma membranes of certain neurons and other cells. They play several roles, including acting as the main end-receptor stimulated by acetylcholine released from postganglionic fibers in the parasympathetic nervous system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Amanita_muscaria_2.jpg/220px-Amanita_muscaria_2.jpg
