63.9	Pussycat_Dolls	Pussycat Dolls	The Pussycat Dolls are an American pop girl group and dance ensemble, founded in Los Angeles by choreographer Robin Antin in 1995 as a burlesque troupe. After attracting national attention, Antin negotiated a record deal with Interscope Records in 2003 turning the group into a music franchise, which developed a global image and commercial brand overseen by Antin, Interscope and various partners. The first recording group produced two albums and numerous singles between 2004 and 2009 including the world-wide hits "Don't Cha", "Stickwitu", "Beep", "Buttons", "When I Grow Up", and "Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)". "Stickwitu" earned a 2005 Grammy Award nomination, and the Dolls brand diversified into merchandise, reality television programs, a Las Vegas act, product endorsements, spin-off recording groups (Girlicious, Paradiso Girls) and other ventures. By early 2010 the first Dolls recording group had disbanded.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/PCD_-_DDWT.jpg/299px-PCD_-_DDWT.jpg
