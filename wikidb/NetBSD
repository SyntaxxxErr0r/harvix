57.4	NetBSD	NetBSD	NetBSD is a freely available open source Unix-like computer operating system descended from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix derivative developed at the University of California, Berkeley. It was the second open source BSD descendant to be formally released, after 386BSD, and continues to be actively developed. The NetBSD project is primarily focused on high quality design, stability and performance of the system. Due to its portability and Berkeley-style license, NetBSD is often used in embedded systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/NetBSD.svg/200px-NetBSD.svg.png
