55.4	Hans_Holbein_the_Younger	Hans Holbein the Younger	Hans Holbein the Younger (c. 1497 â€“ between 7 October and 29 November 1543) was a German artist and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style. He is best known as one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called "the Younger" to distinguish him from his father, Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger%2C_self-portrait.jpg/220px-Hans_Holbein_the_Younger%2C_self-portrait.jpg
