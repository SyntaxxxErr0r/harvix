18.73	United_Methodist	United Methodist Church	The United Methodist Church is a Methodist Christian denomination which is both mainline Protestant and evangelical. Founded in 1968 by the union of The Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, the UMC traces its roots back to the revival movement of John and Charles Wesley within the Church of England. As such, the church's theological orientation is decidedly Wesleyan. It contains both liturgical and evangelical elements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Logo_of_the_United_Methodist_Church.svg/100px-Logo_of_the_United_Methodist_Church.svg.png
