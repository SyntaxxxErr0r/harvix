4.01	Gray's_Inn_Road	Gray's Inn Road	Gray's Inn Road, formerly Gray's Inn Lane, is a major road in central London, in the London Borough of Camden. (The street signs vary, with and without the apostrophe.) It is named after Gray's Inn, one of the main Inns of Court. The road starts in Holborn, near Chancery Lane tube station and the boundaries of the City of London and the London Borough of Islington. From here it goes north and slightly west, forming the boundary between Clerkenwell to the east and Holborn, Bloomsbury and finally St Pancras to the west.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Gray%27s_Inn_Rd_sign.jpg/220px-Gray%27s_Inn_Rd_sign.jpg
