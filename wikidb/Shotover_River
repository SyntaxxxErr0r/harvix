6.20	Shotover_River	Shotover River	The Shotover River is located in the Otago region of the South Island of New Zealand. The name correctly suggests that this 60 kilometre-long river is fast flowing, with numerous rapids. The river was named Shotover by the first European, William Gilbert Rees, to settle on the shores of Lake Wakatipu in 1860. He named it after his business partner, George Gamie's English estate, Shotover Park. The river had been previously called Tummel by two Scottish pioneers named Cameron and MacDonald who had passed through the area before Rees arrived. It was also referred to as the Overshot by the early goldminers, but it was the name Shotover that stuck, (A better citation would be preferred here. You can help Wikipedia by providing one.) The river flows generally south from the Southern Alps on its journey running through the Skippers Canyon, before draining into the Kawarau River east of Queenstown.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e2/Shotover_Jet.JPG/200px-Shotover_Jet.JPG
