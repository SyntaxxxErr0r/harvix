12.20	Politics_of_Jamaica	Politics of Jamaica	The Politics of Jamaica takes place in a framework of a representative parliamentary democratic monarchy. The 1962 Constitution of Jamaica established a parliamentary system based on the United Kingdom model. As chief of state, Queen Elizabeth II appoints a governor general, on the advice of the prime minister, as her representative in Jamaica. The governor general's role is largely ceremonial. Executive power is vested in the cabinet, led by the Prime Minister. Jamaica is an independent country and Commonwealth Realm. It is a parliamentary democracy whose political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament. Jamaica's current Constitution was drafted in 1962 by a bipartisan joint committee of the Jamaican legislature. It came into force with the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962 of the United Kingdom Parliament, which gave Jamaica political independence. Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on English common law.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Coat_of_Arms_of_Jamaica.svg/140px-Coat_of_Arms_of_Jamaica.svg.png
