3.12	Dr._H.H._Holmes	H. H. Holmes	Herman Webster Mudgett (May 16, 1861 â€“ May 7, 1896), better known under the alias of Dr. Henry Howard Holmes, was one of the first documented American serial killers in the modern sense of the term. In Chicago at the time of the 1893 World's Fair, Holmes opened a hotel which he had designed and built for himself specifically with murder in mind, and which was the location of many of his murders. While he confessed to 27 murders, of which four were confirmed, his actual body count could be as high as 200. He took an unknown number of his victims from the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, which was less than two miles away, in his "World's Fair" hotel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/H.H.Holmes.gif
