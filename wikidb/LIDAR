151.9	LIDAR	LIDAR	LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technology that can measure the distance to, or other properties of a target by illuminating the target with light, often using pulses from a laser. LIDAR technology has application in geomatics, archaeology, geography, geology, geomorphology, seismology, forestry, remote sensing and atmospheric physics, as well as in airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM), laser altimetry and LIDAR contour mapping.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Starfire_Optical_Range_-_sodium_laser.jpg/200px-Starfire_Optical_Range_-_sodium_laser.jpg
