4.11	K-medoids	k-medoids	The -medoids algorithm is a clustering algorithm related to the -means algorithm and the medoidshift algorithm. Both the -means and -medoids algorithms are partitional (breaking the dataset up into groups) and both attempt to minimize the distance between points labeled to be in a cluster and a point designated as the center of that cluster. In contrast to the -means algorithm, -medoids chooses datapoints as centers (medoids or exemplars).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Kmedoid1.jpg/400px-Kmedoid1.jpg
