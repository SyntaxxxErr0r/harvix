With males and females weighing around 3.5 kg and 1.8 kg respectively, it is mainland Australia's largest, and the world's longest (the biggest is the Tasmanian Devil), living carnivorous marsupial and it is considered an apex predator. Two subspecies are recognised, the nominate is found in wet forests of southeastern Australia and Tasmania, and a northern subspecies gracilis is found in a small area of northern Queensland and is endangered.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Dasyurus_maculatus.jpg/220px-Dasyurus_maculatus.jpg
