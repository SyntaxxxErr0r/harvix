80.1	Crack_cocaine	Crack cocaine	Crack cocaine is the freebase form of cocaine that can be smoked. It may also be termed rock, hard, iron, cavvy, base, or just crack; it is the most addictive form of cocaine. Crack rocks offer a short but intense high to smokers. Crack appeared primarily in impoverished inner-city neighborhoods in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami in late 1984 and 1985. Its rise to popularity can be attributed to the discovery that baking soda was a low cost and simple replacement for the diethyl ether used in preparation of free base cocaine. The name "crack" refers to the sound generated during its manufacture and when smoked.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Crack_street_dosage.jpg/220px-Crack_street_dosage.jpg
