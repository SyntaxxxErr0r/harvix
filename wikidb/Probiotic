146.1	Probiotic	Probiotic	Probiotics are live microorganisms thought to be beneficial to the host organism. According to the currently adopted definition by FAO/WHO, probiotics are: "Live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host". Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria are the most common types of microbes used as probiotics; but certain yeasts and bacilli may also be used. Probiotics are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods with specially added active live cultures; such as in yogurt, soy yogurt, or as dietary supplements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Ilya_Ilyich_Mechnikov_1913.jpg/160px-Ilya_Ilyich_Mechnikov_1913.jpg
