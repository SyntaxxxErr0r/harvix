73.5	Victorian_architecture	Victorian architecture	The term Victorian architecture refers collectively to several architectural styles employed predominantly during the middle and late 19th century. The period that it indicates may slightly overlap the actual reign, 20 June 1837 â€“ 22 January 1901, of Queen Victoria. This represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it follows Georgian architecture and Regency architecture, and was succeeded by Edwardian architecture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/LondonMidlandHotel-PS01.JPG/250px-LondonMidlandHotel-PS01.JPG
