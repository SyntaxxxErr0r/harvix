54.6	Steak_tartare	Steak tartare	Steak tartare is a meat dish made from finely chopped or minced raw beef or horse. Tartare can also be made by thinly slicing a high grade of meat such as strip steak, marinating it in wine or other spirits, spicing it to taste, and then chilling it. This is often served with onions, capers and seasonings (the latter typically incorporating fresh ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce), sometimes with a raw egg yolk, and often on rye bread.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Tatar-1.jpg/220px-Tatar-1.jpg
