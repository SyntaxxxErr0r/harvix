The Museum honors those who died by celebrating their lives â€“ cherishing the traditions that they embraced, examining their achievements and faith, and affirming the vibrant worldwide Jewish community that is their legacy today. The building, designed by Roche-Dinkeloo, is topped by a pyramid structure called the Living Memorial to the Holocaust.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Museum_of_Jewish_Heritage_005.JPG/250px-Museum_of_Jewish_Heritage_005.JPG
