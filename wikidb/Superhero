108.8	Superhero	Superhero	A superhero is a type of stock character, dedicated to protecting the public. Since the debut of the prototypical superhero Superman in 1938, stories of superheroes — ranging from brief episodic adventures to continuing years-long sagas — have dominated comic books and crossed over into other media. The word itself dates to at least 1916. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine. "Super heroes" is a trademark co-owned by DC Comics and Marvel Comics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Fleishersuperman.jpg/220px-Fleishersuperman.jpg
