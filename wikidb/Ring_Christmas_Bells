It was composed by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych with English lyrics entirely unrelated to the original ones created later by American composer Peter J. Wilhousky. The song is based on a folk chant known in Ukrainian as "Shchedryk". Wilhousky's lyrics and the English name are copyrighted, although the original musical composition is not.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Shchedryk_4-note_motif.jpg/350px-Shchedryk_4-note_motif.jpg
