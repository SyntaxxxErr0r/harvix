9.20	Music_of_New_Zealand	Music of New Zealand	The music of New Zealand is the expression of the culture of New Zealand. New Zealand's music is influenced by the culture of the indigenous MƒÅori and immigrants from the Pacific region, though its musical origins lie predominantly in British colonial history, with contributions from Europe and America. As the nation grew and established its own culture, local artists combined these styles with local influences to create music that is distinctively New Zealand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg/150px-Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg.png
