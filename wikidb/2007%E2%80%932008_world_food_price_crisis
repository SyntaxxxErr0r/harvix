81.5	2007%E2%80%932008_world_food_price_crisis	2007â€“2008 world food price crisis	World food prices increased dramatically in 2007 and the 1st and 2nd quarter of 2008 creating a global crisis and causing political and economical instability and social unrest in both poor and developed nations. Although the media spotlight focused on the riots that ensued in the face of high prices, the ongoing crisis of food insecurity has been years in the making. Systemic causes for the worldwide increases in food prices continue to be the subject of debate. After peaking in the second quarter of 2008 prices fell dramatically during the Late-2000s recession but have increased during 2009 and 2010, peaking again in early 2011 at a level sightly higher than the level reached in 2008. However a repeat of the crisis of 2008 is not anticipated due to ample stockpiles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/GlobalTrade_wheat_coarse_grain_soy_2008_usda.png/300px-GlobalTrade_wheat_coarse_grain_soy_2008_usda.png
