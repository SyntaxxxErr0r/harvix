15.11	Sawfly	Sawfly	Sawfly is the common name for insects belonging to suborder Symphyta of the order Hymenoptera. Sawflies are distinguishable from most other Hymenoptera by the broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax, and by their caterpillar-like larvae. The common name comes from the saw-like appearance of the ovipositor, which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs. Large populations of certain sawfly species can cause substantial economic damage to forests and cultivated plants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Melaleuca_sawfly.jpg/220px-Melaleuca_sawfly.jpg
