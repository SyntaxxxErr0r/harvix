54.1	United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury	United States Secretary of the Treasury	The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is the head of the United States Department of the Treasury, which is concerned with financial and monetary matters, and, until 2003, also with some issues of national security and defense. This position in the Federal Government of the United States is analogous to the Minister of Finance in many other countries. Most of the Department's law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Customs Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the U.S. Secret Service were reassigned to other Departments in 2003 in conjunction with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The Secretary of the Treasury is a member of the President's Cabinet, and since the Clinton Administration, has been a member of the U.S. National Security Council. By law and by tradition, the Secretary of the Treasury is fifth in the United States presidential line of succession, in case of some extreme calamity in the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/US-DeptOfTheTreasury-Seal.svg/100px-US-DeptOfTheTreasury-Seal.svg.png
