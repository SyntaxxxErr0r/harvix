They are part of the order Pilosa and are therefore related to armadillos and anteaters, which sport a similar set of specialized claws. Sloths are arboreal (tree dwelling) residents of the jungles of Central and South America, and are known for being slow-moving.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Bradypus.jpg/220px-Bradypus.jpg
