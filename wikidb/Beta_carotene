40.36	Beta_carotene	beta-Carotene	β-Carotene is a strongly-coloured red-orange pigment abundant in plants and fruits. It is an organic compound and chemically is classified as a hydrocarbon and specifically as a terpenoid (isoprenoid), reflecting its derivation from isoprene units. β-Carotene is biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. It is a member of the carotenes, which are tetraterpenes, synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units and thus having 40 carbons. Among this general class of carotenes, β-Carotene is distinguished by having beta-rings at both ends of the molecule. Absorption of β-Carotene is enhanced if eaten with fats, as carotenes are fat soluble.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Beta-Carotin.svg/300px-Beta-Carotin.svg.png
