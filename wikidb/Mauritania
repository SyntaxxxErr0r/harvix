It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean in the west, by Western Sahara in the north, by Algeria in the northeast, by Mali in the east and southeast, and by Senegal in the southwest. It is named after the ancient Berber Kingdom of Mauretania, which later became a province of the Roman Empire, even though the modern state covers a territory far to the southwest of the old kingdom. The capital and largest city is Nouakchott, located on the Atlantic coast.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Flag_of_Mauritania.svg/125px-Flag_of_Mauritania.svg.png
