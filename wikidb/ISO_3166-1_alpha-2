They are the most widely used of the country codes published by ISO (the others being alpha-3 and numeric), and are used most prominently for the Internet's country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions). They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Europe_ISO_3166-1.svg/400px-Europe_ISO_3166-1.svg.png
