62.3	Surface_normal	Normal (geometry)	In geometry, an object such as a line or vector is called a normal to another object if they are perpendicular to each other. For example, in the two-dimensional case, the normal line to a curve at a given point is the line perpendicular to the tangent line to the curve at the point.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Normal_vectors2.svg/220px-Normal_vectors2.svg.png
