73.0	Harmony	Harmony	In music, harmony is the use of simultaneous pitches , or chords. The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the "horizontal" aspect. Counterpoint, which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/US_Navy_080615-N-7656R-003_Navy_Band_Northwest%27s_Barbershop_Quartet_win_the_hearts_of_the_audience_with_a_John_Philip_Sousa_rendition_of_.jpg/300px-US_Navy_080615-N-7656R-003_Navy_Band_Northwest%27s_Barbershop_Quartet_win_the_hearts_of_the_audience_with_a_John_Philip_Sousa_rendition_of_.jpg
