1.00	Offended	Insult	An insult (also called a slur, scoff, slight or putdown) is an expression, statement (or sometimes behavior) which is considered degrading and offensive. Insults (sometimes called "cracks" "remarks" or one-liners) may be intentional or accidental. An example of the latter is a well-intended simple explanation, which in fact is superfluous, but is given due to underestimating the intelligence or knowledge of the other.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/3012_-_Catania_-_Graffiti_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto%2C_5-July-2008.jpg/220px-3012_-_Catania_-_Graffiti_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto%2C_5-July-2008.jpg
