3.00	Wilton_diptych	Wilton Diptych	The Wilton Diptych (c. 1395â€“99) is a small portable diptych of two hinged panels, painted on both sides. It is an extremely rare survival of a late Medieval religious panel painting from England. The diptych was painted for King Richard II of England who is depicted kneeling before the Virgin and Child in what is known as a votive portrait. The painting is an outstanding example of the International Gothic style, and the nationality of the unknown artist is probably French or English. It belongs to the National Gallery, London.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/The_Wilton_Diptych_%28left%29.jpg/200px-The_Wilton_Diptych_%28left%29.jpg
