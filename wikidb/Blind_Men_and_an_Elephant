73.3	Blind_Men_and_an_Elephant	Blind men and an elephant	The Buddha twice uses the simile of blind men led astray. In the Canki Sutta he describes a row of blind men holding on to each other as an example of those who follow an old text that has passed down from generation to generation, much like the Christian Gospel (Matthew 15.14) saying about the blind leading the blind. In the Udana (68â€“69) he uses the elephant parable to describe sectarian quarrels. A king has the blind men of the capital brought to the palace, where an elephant is brought in and they are asked to describe it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Blind.JPG/300px-Blind.JPG
