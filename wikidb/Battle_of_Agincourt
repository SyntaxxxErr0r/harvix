131.8	Battle_of_Agincourt	Battle of Agincourt	The Battle of Agincourt was a major English victory against a numerically superior French army in the Hundred Years' War. The battle occurred on Friday, 25 October 1415 , near modern-day Azincourt, in northern France. Henry V's victory crippled France and started a new period in the war, during which, first, Henry married the French king's daughter and, second, his son, Henry VI, was made heir to the throne of France (although Henry VI later failed to capitalise on his father's battlefield success).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Schlacht_von_Azincourt.jpg/300px-Schlacht_von_Azincourt.jpg
