1.00	Alazen	Alhazen	(965 in Basra – c. 1040 in Cairo) was a Muslim, scientist and polymath described in various sources as either Arabic or Persian. He is frequently referred to as Ibn al-Haytham, and sometimes as al-Basri (Arabic: البصري), after his birthplace in the city of Basra. Alhazen made significant contributions to the principles of optics, as well as to physics, astronomy, mathematics, ophthalmology, philosophy, visual perception, and to the scientific method. He was also nicknamed Ptolemaeus Secundus ("Ptolemy the Second") or simply "The Physicist" in medieval Europe. Alhazen wrote insightful commentaries on works by Aristotle, Ptolemy, and the Greek mathematician Euclid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Ibn_al-Haytham.png/220px-Ibn_al-Haytham.png
