6.20	Windsurf	Windsurfing	Windsurfing or sailboarding is a surface water sport that combines elements of surfing and sailing. It consists of a board usually two to four metres long, powered by the orthogonal effect of the wind on a sail. The rig is connected to the board by a free-rotating universal joint and comprises a mast, wishbone boom and sail. The sail area ranges from less than 2.5 m2 to more than 12 m2 depending on the conditions, the skill of the sailor and the type of windsurfing being undertaken.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/DSCF1252.JPG/220px-DSCF1252.JPG
