7.11	Purcell_Mountains	Purcell Mountains	The Purcell Mountains are a mountain range in southeastern British Columbia, Canada. They are a subrange of the Columbia Mountains, which includes the Selkirk, Monashee, and Cariboo Mountains. They are located on the west side of the Rocky Mountain Trench in the area of the Columbia Valley, and on the east side of the valley of Kootenay Lake and the Duncan River. The only large settlement in the mountains is the Panorama Ski Resort, though there are small settlements, such as Yahk and Moyie along the Crowsnest Highway, and residential rural areas dependent on the cities of Creston, Kimberley and Cranbrook, which are located adjacent to the range.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/Purcellmountainrange.jpg/256px-Purcellmountainrange.jpg
