3.00	Tain_Bo_Cuailgne	Táin Bó Cúailnge	is a legendary tale from early Irish literature, often considered an epic, although it is written primarily in prose rather than verse. It tells of a war against Ulster by the Connacht queen Medb and her husband Ailill, who intend to steal the stud bull Donn Cuailnge, opposed only by the teenage Ulster hero Cú Chulainn. A similar tale set in the West of Ireland is Táin Bó Flidhais.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Cuinbattle.jpg/200px-Cuinbattle.jpg
