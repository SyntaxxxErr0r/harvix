56.4	Eternity	Eternity	While in the popular mind, eternity (or foreverness) often simply means existence for a limitless amount of time, many have used it to refer to a timeless existence altogether outside time. By contrast, infinite temporal existence is then called sempiternity. Something eternal exists outside time; by contrast, something sempiternal exists throughout an infinite time. Sempiternity is also known as everlastingness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/4404_-_Milano%2C_Duomo_-_Monumento_%281611%29_Consacrazione_1577_-_Pietro_Daverio%2C_L%27eternit%C3%A0_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto_-_6-Dec-2007.jpg/240px-4404_-_Milano%2C_Duomo_-_Monumento_%281611%29_Consacrazione_1577_-_Pietro_Daverio%2C_L%27eternit%C3%A0_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto_-_6-Dec-2007.jpg
