58.1	Hallucination	Hallucination	A hallucination, in the broadest sense of the word, is a perception in the absence of a stimulus. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are defined as perceptions in a conscious and awake state in the absence of external stimuli which have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness; illusion, which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; imagery, which does not mimic real perception and is under voluntary control; and pseudohallucination, which does not mimic real perception, but is not under voluntary control. Hallucinations also differ from "delusional perceptions", in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus (i.e. a real perception) is given some additional (and typically bizarre) significance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/August_Natterer_Meine_Augen_zur_Zeit_der_Erscheinungen.jpg/230px-August_Natterer_Meine_Augen_zur_Zeit_der_Erscheinungen.jpg
