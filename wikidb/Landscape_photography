27.04	Landscape_photography	Landscape photography	Landscape photography is a genre intended to show different spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. This popular style of photography is practiced by professionals and amateurs alike. Photographs typically capture the presence of nature and are often free of man-made obstructions. Landscape photographers usually attempt not only to convey the documentary aspect, but also an appreciation of the scenery that is being photographed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Adams_The_Tetons_and_the_Snake_River.jpg/220px-Adams_The_Tetons_and_the_Snake_River.jpg
