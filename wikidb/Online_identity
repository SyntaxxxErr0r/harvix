56.5	Online_identity	Online identity	The social web, i.e. the usage of the web to support the social process, represents a space in which people have the possibility to express and expose their identity in a social context. For instance people define explicitly their identity by creating user profiles in social network services such as Facebook or LinkedIn or in online dating services (Siibak 2007). By using blogs and expressing opinions, they define more tacit identities.
