133.8	Capital_punishment	Capital punishment	Capital punishment, the death penalty, death sentence, or execution is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. Crimes that can result in a death penalty are known as capital crimes or capital offences. The term capital originates from the Latin capitalis, literally "regarding the head" (referring to execution by beheading).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Auguste_Vaillant_execution.jpg/170px-Auguste_Vaillant_execution.jpg
