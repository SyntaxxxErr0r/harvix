97.5	Currying	Currying	In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments (or an n-tuple of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions each with a single argument . It was discovered by Moses Schönfinkel and later re-discovered by Haskell Curry . Because of this, some say it would be more correct to name it schönfinkeling.
