55.4	Convention_on_the_Prevention_and_Punishment_of_the_Crime_of_Genocide	Genocide Convention	The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 9 December 1948 as General Assembly Resolution 260. The Convention entered into force on 12 January 1951. It defines genocide in legal terms, and is the culmination of years of campaigning by lawyer Raphael Lemkin. Yaur Auron writes "When Raphael Lemkin coined the word genocide in 1944 he cited the 1915 annihilation of Armenians as a seminal example of genocide." All participating countries are advised to prevent and punish actions of genocide in war and in peacetime. The number of states that have ratified the convention is currently 140.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Genocide_Convention_Participation.svg/300px-Genocide_Convention_Participation.svg.png
