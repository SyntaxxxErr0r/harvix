Some of these words have been misinterpreted, reinterpreted or undergone significant change in meaning. In addition, a variety of terms relating to anime and manga and the associated fandom have arisen, either by translation/transliteration from Japanese or as part of the shared slang or jargon of the subculture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Anime_eye.svg/150px-Anime_eye.svg.png
