56.4	Magma	Magma	Magma (from Greek μάγμα "paste") is a mixture of molten or semi molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals and dissolved gas and sometimes also gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or turn into a pluton. Magma is capable of intrusion into adjacent rocks, extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Pahoehoe_toe.jpg/300px-Pahoehoe_toe.jpg
