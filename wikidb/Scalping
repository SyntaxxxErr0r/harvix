27.22	Scalping	Scalping	Scalping is the act of removing another person's scalp or a portion of their scalp, either from a dead body or from a living person. The initial purpose of scalping was to provide a trophy of battle or portable proof of a combatant's prowess in war. Eventually, the act became motivated primarily for financial reasons; people received payment per scalp they acquired.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Hannah_Duston%2C_by_Stearns.jpg/400px-Hannah_Duston%2C_by_Stearns.jpg
