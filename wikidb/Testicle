56.9	Testicle	Testicle	The testicle (from Latin testiculus, diminutive of testis, meaning "witness" of virility, plural testes) is the male gonad in animals. Like the ovaries to which they are homologous, testes are components of both the reproductive system and the endocrine system. The primary functions of the testes are to produce sperm and to produce androgens, primarily testosterone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Gray1144.png/250px-Gray1144.png
