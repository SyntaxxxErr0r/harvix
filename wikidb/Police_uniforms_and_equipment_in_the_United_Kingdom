3.11	Police_uniforms_and_equipment_in_the_United_Kingdom	Police uniforms and equipment in the United Kingdom	Police uniforms and equipment in the United Kingdom have varied considerably from the inception of what was to become the earliest recognisable mainstream police force in the country with the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829. Allowing the formation of the Metropolitan Police Service, and the various County Police Acts, policing became a more standardised practice in the United Kingdom throughout the late nineteenth century, the uniforms and equipment became equally standardised. From a variety of home grown uniforms, bicycles, swords and pistols the British police force evolved in look and equipment through the long coats and top hat, to the recognisable modern uniform of a white shirt, black tie (or cravat for women in many forces), reflective jackets, body armour, and the panda car.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/1919_Battle_of_George_Square_-_David_Kirkwood.jpg/290px-1919_Battle_of_George_Square_-_David_Kirkwood.jpg
