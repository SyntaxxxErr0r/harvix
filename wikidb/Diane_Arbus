132.2	Diane_Arbus	Diane Arbus	Diane Arbus (March 14, 1923 â€“ July 26, 1971) was an American photographer and writer noted for black-and-white square photographs of "deviant and marginal people (dwarfs, giants, transvestites, nudists, circus performers) or of people whose normality seems ugly or surreal." A friend said that Arbus said that she was "afraid... that she would be known simply as 'the photographer of freaks'"; however, that phrase has been used repeatedly to describe her.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Diane-Arbus-1949.jpg/250px-Diane-Arbus-1949.jpg
