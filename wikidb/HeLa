102.5	HeLa	HeLa	A HeLa cell (also Hela or hela cell) is a cell type in an immortal cell line used in scientific research. It is the oldest and most commonly used human cell line. The line was derived from cervical cancer cells taken on February 8, 1951 from Henrietta Lacks, a patient who eventually died of her cancer on October 4, 1951. The cell line was found to be remarkably durable and prolific as illustrated by its contamination of many other cell lines used in research.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Hela_Cells_Image_3709-PH.jpg/200px-Hela_Cells_Image_3709-PH.jpg
