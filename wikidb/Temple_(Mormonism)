15.72	Temple_(Mormonism)	Temple (Latter Day Saints)	In the Latter Day Saint movement, a temple is a building dedicated to be a house of God and is reserved for special forms of worship. A temple differs from a church meetinghouse, which is used for weekly worship services. Temples have been a significant part of the Latter Day Saint movement since early in its inception. Today, temples are operated by several Latter Day Saint denominations. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has 135 operating temples worldwide to perform Endowment ceremonies, marriages, and other services for both the living and by proxy in behalf of dead ancestors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/SLC_Temple_east_side_night.jpg/220px-SLC_Temple_east_side_night.jpg
