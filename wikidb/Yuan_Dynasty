55.5	Yuan_Dynasty	Yuan Dynasty	The Yuan Dynasty was the Chinese branch of Mongol Borjigin dynasty established by Genghis Khan. Although the Mongolians had ruled northern China for decades, it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style. His realm – the Great Yuan Empire (t 大元帝國, s 大元帝国, p Dà Yuán Dìguó) – was by this point isolated from the other khanates and controlled only most of present-day China and its surrounding areas including modern Mongolia. It was the first non-Han dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368, after which its remnants in Mongolia were known as the Northern Yuan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Yuen_Dynasty_1294.png/250px-Yuen_Dynasty_1294.png
