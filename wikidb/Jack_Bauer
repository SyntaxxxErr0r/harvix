His character has worked in various capacities on the show, often as a member of the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) based in Los Angeles, and working with the FBI in Washington, D.C. during season 7. Within the 24 storyline, Bauer is a key member of CTU and is often portrayed as their most capable agent. Bauer's job usually involves helping prevent major terrorist attacks on the United States, saving both civilian lives and government administrations. On many occasions Jack does so at great personal expense, as those he thwarts subsequently target him and his loved ones. Bauer's frequent use of torture to gather information has generated much controversy and discussion. Entertainment Weekly named Jack Bauer one of The 20 All Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Jack_Bauer.jpg/200px-Jack_Bauer.jpg
