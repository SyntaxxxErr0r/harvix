97.9	Crystal	Crystal	A crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are arranged in an orderly, repeating pattern extending in all three spatial dimensions. In addition to their microscopic structure, large crystals are usually identifiable by their macroscopic geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Amethist_quartz.jpeg/150px-Amethist_quartz.jpeg
