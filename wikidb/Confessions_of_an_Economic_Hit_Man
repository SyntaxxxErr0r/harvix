57.0	Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man	Confessions of an Economic Hit Man	Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is a book written by John Perkins and published in 2004. It provides Perkins' account of his career with consulting firm Chas. T. Main in Boston. Before employment with the firm, he interviewed for a job with the National Security Agency (NSA). Perkins claims that this interview effectively constituted an independent screening which led to his subsequent hiring by Einar Greve, a member of the firm (and alleged NSA liaison) to become a self-described "economic hit man". The book was allegedly referred to in an audio tape released by Osama Bin Laden in September 2009.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/28/Confessions_of_An_Economic_Hitman_Cover.jpg/200px-Confessions_of_An_Economic_Hitman_Cover.jpg
