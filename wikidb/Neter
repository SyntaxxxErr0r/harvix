1.00	Neter	August Natterer	Natterer was one of the "schizophrenic masters" profiled by Hans Prinzhorn in his field-defining work Artistry of the Mentally Ill. His drawings are attempts to capture the "10,000 images" of his April Fool's Day hallucination, and are always rendered in a clear, objective style, like that of a technical drawing. This may be due to his background as an electrician.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/August_Natterer.jpg/220px-August_Natterer.jpg
