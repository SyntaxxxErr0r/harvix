1.10	Waitangi_Day_Act	Waitangi Day Act	There have been two Waitangi Day Acts passed by the New Zealand Parliament: the Waitangi Day Act 1960 and the Waitangi Day Act 1976. Neither made the sixth of February a public holiday; this was done by the New Zealand Day Act 1973. The first Waitangi Day Act was a token gesture towards acknowledging the Treaty of Waitangi. The second changed the name of the day from New Zealand Day back to Waitangi Day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Coat_of_Arms_of_New_Zealand.svg/180px-Coat_of_Arms_of_New_Zealand.svg.png
