76.6	Rule_of_three_(writing)	Rule of three (writing)	The "rule of three" is a principle in writing that suggests that things that come in threes are inherently funnier, more satisfying, or more effective than other numbers of things. The reader/audience of this form of text is also more likely to consume information if it is written in groups of threes. From slogans ("Go, fight, win!") to films, many things are structured in threes. Examples include The Three Stooges, Three Little Pigs, Three Billy Goats Gruff, Goldilocks and the Three Bears and Three Blind Mice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/The_Three_Bears_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_17034.jpg/220px-The_Three_Bears_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_17034.jpg
