2.00	Revenue_equivalence_theorem	Auction theory	When it is necessary to make explicit assumptions about bidders' value distributions, most of the published research assumes symmetric bidders. This means that the probability distribution from which the bidders obtain their values (or signals) is identical across bidders. In a private values model which assumes independence, symmetry implies that the bidders' values are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/EnumaElish102.jpg/100px-EnumaElish102.jpg
