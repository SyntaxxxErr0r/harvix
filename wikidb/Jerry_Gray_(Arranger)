1.00	Jerry_Gray_(Arranger)	Jerry Gray (arranger)	Jerry Gray (July 3, 1915 â€“ August 10, 1976) was an American violinist, arranger, composer, and leader of swing dance orchestras bearing his name. He is widely known for his work with popular music during the Swing era. His name is inextricably linked to two of the most famous bandleaders of the time, Artie Shaw and Glenn Miller. Gray, along with Bill Finegan, wrote many of Glenn Miller's arrangements during the late 1930s and early 1940s. In the latter part of Grey's career, his orchestra served as the house band at the Venetian Room of the Fairmont Hotel, Dallas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Jerry_Gray_%28arranger%29.jpg/220px-Jerry_Gray_%28arranger%29.jpg
