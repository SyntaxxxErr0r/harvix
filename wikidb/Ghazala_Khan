11.21	Ghazala_Khan	Honor killing of Ghazala Khan	Ghazala Khan (1987–23 September 2005) was a Pakistani woman, who was shot and killed in Denmark by her brother after she had married against the will of the family. The murder of Ghazala had been ordered by her father to save the family honour, making it a so‐called honour killing. No fewer than nine people from her family took part in arranging and performing the murder and they were all found guilty by Østre Landsret (the High Court of Eastern Denmark) on 27 June 2006 on counts of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter (of her husband). This was a ruling of historic importance, the first time in western Europe that such a large number of family members were found guilty in an "honour killing" case. It is expected that the conviction will serve as precedent throughout Europe for future similar cases and that the sentencing will send a strong signal and have a noticeable preventive effect. Manu Sareen, a youth worker helping girls facing arranged marriage says: "It will have a preventive effect. Some families may abandon similar plans because of today's ruling."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/GhazalaKhan1.jpg/200px-GhazalaKhan1.jpg
