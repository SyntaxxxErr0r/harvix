2.10	Florida_Manatee	West Indian manatee	The West Indian manatee is a manatee, and the largest surviving member of the aquatic mammal order Sirenia (which also includes the dugong and the extinct Steller's sea cow). The West Indian manatee is a species distinct from the Amazonian manatee (T. inunguis), and the African manatee (T. senegalensis). Based on genetic and morphological studies, the West Indian manatee is divided into two subspecies, the Florida manatee (T. m. latirostris) and the Antillean or Caribbean manatee (T. m. manatus). However, recent genetic (mtDNA) research suggests that the West Indian manatee actually falls out into three groups, which are more or less geographically distributed as: (1) Florida and the Greater Antilles; (2) Central and Northern South America; and (3) Northeastern South America.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Manatee_with_calf.PD_-_colour_corrected.jpg/200px-Manatee_with_calf.PD_-_colour_corrected.jpg
