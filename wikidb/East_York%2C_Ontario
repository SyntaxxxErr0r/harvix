6.10	East_York%2C_Ontario	East York	East York is a former municipality within the current city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was a semi-autonomous borough within the overall municipality of Metropolitan Toronto until 1998, when it and several other municipalities were amalgamated into the new "megacity" of Toronto in 1998. One of East York's claims to fame was that, before the amalgamation, it was Canada's only borough.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/East_York_locator.png/250px-East_York_locator.png
