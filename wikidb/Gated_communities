10.11	Gated_communities	Gated community	In its modern form, a gated community is a form of residential community or housing estate containing strictly-controlled entrances for pedestrians, bicycles, and automobiles, and often characterized by a closed perimeter of walls and fences. Gated communities usually consist of small residential streets and include various shared amenities. For smaller communities this may be only a park or other common area. For larger communities, it may be possible for residents to stay within the community for most day-to-day activities. Gated communities are a type of common interest development, but are distinct from intentional communities. In countries with a low Human Development Index and/or high Gini coefficient, gated communities attempt to provide security to the upper class as well as expatriates.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Paradisevillagegatedcommunity.jpg/300px-Paradisevillagegatedcommunity.jpg
