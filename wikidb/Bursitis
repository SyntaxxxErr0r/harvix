36.38	Bursitis	Bursitis	Bursitis is the inflammation of one or more bursae (small sacs) of synovial fluid in the body. The bursae rest at the points where internal functionaries, such as muscles and tendons, slide across bone. Healthy bursae create a smooth, almost frictionless functional gliding surface making normal movement painless. When bursitis occurs, however, movement relying upon the inflamed bursa becomes difficult and painful. Moreover, movement of tendons and muscles over the inflamed bursa aggravates its inflammation, perpetuating the problem.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Bursitis_Elbow_WC.JPG/230px-Bursitis_Elbow_WC.JPG
