27.01	Bektashi	Bektashi Order	Bektashi Order founded in the 13th century by the Persian saint Haji Bektash Veli and particularly found throughout Anatolia and the Balkans. In addition to the spiritual teachings of Haji Bektash Veli the order was significantly influenced during its formative period by both the Hurufis (early 15th century) as well as the Qalandariyah stream within Sufism, which took many forms in 13th century Anatolia. The mystical practices and rituals of the Bektashi order were systematized and structured by BalÄ±m Sultan in the 16th century after which many of the order's distinct practices and beliefs took shape.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Basmala.svg/170px-Basmala.svg.png
