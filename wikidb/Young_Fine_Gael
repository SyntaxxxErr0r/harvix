4.00	Young_Fine_Gael	Young Fine Gael	Young Fine Gael is the autonomous youth wing of the major Irish political party Fine Gael. It offers its members scope to assist in formulation of political policy, and the day to day running of the senior party. It is a founding member of the Christian Democratic centre-right pan-European organisation, Youth of the European Peoples Party, which is the youth wing of the European Peoples Party. YFG's constitution however allows for the organisation to act on its own, independent from its parent party, enabling it to promote its own political objectives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a6/YFGpie.png/250px-YFGpie.png
