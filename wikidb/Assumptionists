4.70	Assumptionists	Assumptionists	The Augustinians of the Assumption (A.A.) constitute a congregation of Catholic religious (priests and brothers), founded in NÃ®mes, southern France, by Fr. Emmanuel d'Alzon in 1845, initially approved by Rome in 1857 and definitively approved in 1864 (the Constitutions were approved in 1923). The current Rule of Life of the congregation draws its inspiration from that of St. Augustine of Hippo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Kruis_san_damiano.gif/150px-Kruis_san_damiano.gif
