52.1	Mountain_Dew	Mountain Dew	Mountain Dew (currently stylized as Mtn Dew in the USA) is a carbonated soft drink brand produced and owned by PepsiCo. The original formula was invented in the 1940s by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman and was first marketed in Marion, VA, Knoxville and Johnson City, Tennessee. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958. The Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired by the Pepsi-Cola company in 1964, at which point its distribution expanded more widely across the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/Mountain_Dew_logo.svg/200px-Mountain_Dew_logo.svg.png
