53.7	Double_jeopardy	Double jeopardy	Double jeopardy is a procedural defence that forbids a defendant from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges following a legitimate acquittal or conviction. In common law countries, a defendant may enter a peremptory plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict (autrefois means "previously" in French), meaning the defendant has been acquitted or convicted of the same offence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/09CFREU-Article50.jpg/350px-09CFREU-Article50.jpg
