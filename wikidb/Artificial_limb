35.37	Artificial_limb	Prosthesis	In medicine, a prosthesis, prosthetic, or prosthetic limb (from Ancient Greek pr√≥sthesis, "addition, application, attachment") is an artificial device extension that replaces a missing body part. It is part of the field of biomechatronics, the science of using mechanical devices with human muscle, skeleton, and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma, disease, or defect. Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth or to supplement defective body parts. Inside the body, artificial heart valves are in common use with artificial hearts and lungs seeing less common use but under active technology development. Other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include hearing aids, artificial eyes, palatal obturator, gastric bands, and dentures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Army_prosthetic.jpg/250px-Army_prosthetic.jpg
