59.4	Lady_Chatterley's_Lover	Lady Chatterley's Lover	Lady Chatterley's Lover is a novel by D. H. Lawrence, first published in 1928. The first edition was printed privately in Florence, Italy with assistance from Pino Orioli; it could not be published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960. (A private edition was issued by Inky Stephensen's Mandrake Press in 1929.) The book soon became notorious for its story of the physical relationship between a working-class man and an aristocratic woman, its explicit descriptions of sex, and its use of then-unprintable words.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/Lady_Chatterleys_Lover.jpg/200px-Lady_Chatterleys_Lover.jpg
