108.7	Macbeth	Macbeth	The Tragedy of Macbeth (commonly called Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare about a man who commits regicide so as to become king and then commits further murders to maintain his power. The play clearly demonstrates the corrupting effect of ambition, but also deals with the relationship between cruelty and masculinity, tyranny and kingship, treachery, violence, guilt, prophecy, and disruption of the natural order.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Thomas_Keene_in_Macbeth_1884_Wikipedia_crop.png/250px-Thomas_Keene_in_Macbeth_1884_Wikipedia_crop.png
