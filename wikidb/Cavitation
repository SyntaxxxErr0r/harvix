54.4	Cavitation	Cavitation	Cavitation is the formation and then immediate implosion of cavities in a liquid – i.e. small liquid-free zones ("bubbles") – that are the consequence of forces acting upon the liquid. It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of pressure that cause the formation of cavities where the pressure is relatively low.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Cavitating-prop.jpg/266px-Cavitating-prop.jpg
