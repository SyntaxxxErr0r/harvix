51.6	Bungee_jumping	Bungee jumping	Bungee jumping (also spelt "Bungy" jumping) is an activity that involves jumping from a tall structure while connected to a large elastic cord. The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to hover above the ground. The thrill comes as much from the free-falling as from the rebounds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/Bill%27s_Bungy_Jump.jpg/220px-Bill%27s_Bungy_Jump.jpg
