59.6	Beatnik	Beatnik	Beatnik was a media stereotype of the 1950s and early 1960s that displayed the more superficial aspects of the Beat Generation literary movement of the 1950s and violent film images, along with a cartoonish depiction of the real-life people and the spiritual quest in Jack Kerouac's autobiographical fiction. Kerouac spoke out against this detour from his original concept.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Beatbeatbeat.jpg/230px-Beatbeatbeat.jpg
