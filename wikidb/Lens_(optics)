57.2	Lens_(optics)	Lens (optics)	A lens is an optical device with perfect or approximate axial symmetry which transmits and refracts light, converging or diverging the beam. A simple lens consists of a single optical element. A compound lens is an array of simple lenses (elements) with a common axis; the use of multiple elements allows more optical aberrations to be corrected than is possible with a single element. Lenses are typically made of glass or transparent plastic. Elements which refract electromagnetic radiation outside the visual spectrum are also called lenses: for instance, a microwave lens can be made from paraffin wax.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/BiconvexLens.jpg/250px-BiconvexLens.jpg
