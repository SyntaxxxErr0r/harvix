8.14	Digital_clock	Digital clock	A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally, i.e. in cyphers, as opposed to an analog clock, where the time is displayed by hands. Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism. (Both analog and digital clocks can be driven either mechanically or electronically, but "clockwork" mechanisms with digital displays are rare.) The biggest digital clock is the Lichtzeitpegel ("Light Time Level") on the television tower Rheinturm DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Digital-clock-alarm.jpg/220px-Digital-clock-alarm.jpg
