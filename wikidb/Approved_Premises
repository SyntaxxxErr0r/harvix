3.00	Approved_Premises	Approved Premises	In the United Kingdom, Approved Premises , formerly known as probation or bail hostels, are residential units which house offenders in the community. They are recognised under the Offender Management Act 2007, and can provoke a hostile reception in the communities in which they are located. There are one hundred such hostels in England and Wales, and a further six in Northern Ireland. Fourteen of the APs in England and Wales were banned from housing child sex offenders in 2006 following a media campaign, which has led to some criticism.
