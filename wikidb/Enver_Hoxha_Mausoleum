1.00	Enver_Hoxha_Mausoleum	Enver Hoxha Museum	Enver Hoxha Museum (Albanian: ) is a former museum in Tirana, Albania opened on October 14, 1988. This pyramid-shaped structure was designed by the daughter and son-in-law of the late communist leader Enver Hoxha. It served as a museum about his legacy, but after 1991 became a conference center and party venue. Some sources have referred to it as the "Enver Hoxha Mausoleum" although this was not an official appellation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Mausoleum_von_Envar_Hoxha.jpg/220px-Mausoleum_von_Envar_Hoxha.jpg
