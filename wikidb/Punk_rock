206.4	Punk_rock	Punk rock	Punk rock is a rock music genre that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/Ramones_-_Ramones_cover.jpg/220px-Ramones_-_Ramones_cover.jpg
