Secretary Clinton has called for the United States to “lead by inducing greater cooperation among a greater number of actors and reducing competition, tilting the balance away from a multi-polar world and toward a multi-partner world,” as she described at the Council on Foreign Relations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/GPI_logo.jpg/220px-GPI_logo.jpg
