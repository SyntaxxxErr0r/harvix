3.00	Bellanca_28-70	Bellanca 28-70	The Bellanca 28-70 was a long-range air racer designed for James Fitzmaurice Irish pioneer aviator, who christened it Irish Swoop. Although it was built in time for the 1934 MacRobertson Race from England to Australia, it was never destined to be a competitive long-distance racer but it was ultimately reborn as a high-speed bomber.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Irish_Swoop.jpg/300px-Irish_Swoop.jpg
