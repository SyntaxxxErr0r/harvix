Created by writer Don Cameron and penciler Carmine Infantino, he is a Sioux who is the sheriff of the small Western town of Elkhorn, where he is known as a master detective. He prefers to be addressed by his proper name, Ohiyesa, but the white citizenry take to calling him "Pow Wow" so stubbornly that he eventually gives up and accepts the nickname among them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/PowWowSmithWC46.jpg
