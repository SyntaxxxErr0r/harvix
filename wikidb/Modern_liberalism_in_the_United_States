Roosevelt's New Deal, John F. Kennedy's New Frontier, and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. It combines social liberalism and social progressivism with support for social justice and a mixed economy. American liberal causes include voting rights for African Americans, abortion rights for women, gay rights and government entitlements such as education and health care.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Yellow_flag_waving.svg/100px-Yellow_flag_waving.svg.png
