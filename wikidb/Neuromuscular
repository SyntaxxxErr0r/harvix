15.32	Neuromuscular	Neuromuscular junction	A neuromuscular junction is the synapse or junction of the axon terminal of a motor neuron with the motor end plate, the highly-excitable region of muscle fiber plasma membrane responsible for initiation of action potentials across the muscle's surface, ultimately causing the muscle to contract. In vertebrates, the signal passes through the neuromuscular junction via the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Electron_micrograph_of_neuromuscular_junction_%28cross-section%29.jpg/250px-Electron_micrograph_of_neuromuscular_junction_%28cross-section%29.jpg
