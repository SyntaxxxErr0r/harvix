10.13	One_Tambon_One_Product	One Tambon One Product	One Tambon One Product is a local entrepreneurship stimulus program designed by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra during the 2001-2006 Thai Rak Thai government. The program aims to support the unique locally made and marketed products of each Thai tambon (subdistrict). Drawing its inspiration from Japan's successful One Village One Product (OVOP) program, Thailand's OTOP program encourages village communities to improve local product quality and marketing, selects one superior product from each tambon to receive formal branding as a "starred OTOP product", and provides a local and international stage for the promotion of these products. OTOP products cover a large array of local products, including handicrafts, cotton and silk garments, pottery, fashion accessories, household items, and foods. After a military junta overthrew the elected government of Thailand in 2006, the OTOP program was canceled and then revived and rebranded.
