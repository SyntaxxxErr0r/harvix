3.01	Fifth_Test,_1948_Ashes_series	Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series	The Fifth Test of the 1948 Ashes series, held at The Oval in London, was the final Test in a cricket series between Australia and England. The match took place on 14–18 August, with a rest day on 15 August. Australia won the match by an innings and 149 runs to complete a 4–0 series win. It was the last Test in the career of Australian captain Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman in the history of the sport. Going into the match, if Australia batted only once, Bradman needed only four runs from his final innings to have a Test batting average of exactly 100, but he failed to score, bowled second ball for a duck by leg spinner Eric Hollies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Bradman%26Bat.jpg/170px-Bradman%26Bat.jpg
