While the new record did not maintain the same popularity as its predecessor, it obtained platinum status and spawned the favorites "Run's House" and "Mary, Mary" (built around a sample from The Monkees' song).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/33/Tougher_Than_Leather.jpg/220px-Tougher_Than_Leather.jpg
