103.1	White_people	White people	White people (also the Caucasian race) is a term usually referring to human beings characterized (at least in part) by the light pigmentation of their skin. Rather than being a straightforward description of skin color, the term white denotes a specific set of ethnic groups and functions as a color metaphor for race.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Egyptian_races.jpg/200px-Egyptian_races.jpg
