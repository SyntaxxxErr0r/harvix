339.1	E-mail_spam	Email spam	Email spam, also known as junk email or unsolicited bulk email , is a subset of electronic spam involving nearly identical messages sent to numerous recipients by email. Definitions of spam usually include the aspects that email is unsolicited and sent in bulk. One subset of UBE is UCE (unsolicited commercial email). The opposite of "spam", email which one wants, is called "ham", usually when referring to a message's automated analysis (such as Bayesian filtering). Like other forms of unwanted bulk messaging, it is named for Spam luncheon meat by way of a Monty Python sketch in which Spam is depicted as ubiquitous and unavoidable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Spammed-mail-folder.png/300px-Spammed-mail-folder.png
