103.0	Cream	Cream	Cream is a dairy product that is composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, over time, the lighter fat rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called "separators". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Milk-bottle.jpg/275px-Milk-bottle.jpg
