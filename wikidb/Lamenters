1.00	Lamenters	Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)	In the fictional universe of Warhammer 40,000 (or Warhammer 40k) setting created by Games Workshop, Space Marines are genetically modified 'super human' soldiers created by the Emperor to conquer the galaxy and defend mankind. According to Games Workshop, there are more than a thousand recorded chapters of Space Marines, most of whom follow the Codex Astartes standard army template. However, there are a considerable number of chapters that deviate from the Codex to different degrees, resulting in considerably different rules and playing styles, such as the Blood Angels and the Space Wolves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/15/Space_Marine_Codex.jpg
