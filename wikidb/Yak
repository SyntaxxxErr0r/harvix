59.9	Yak	Yak	The yak, Bos grunniens or Bos mutus, is a long-haired bovine found throughout the Himalayan region of south Central Asia, the Tibetan Plateau and as far north as Mongolia and Russia. In addition to a large domestic population, there is a small, vulnerable wild yak population. In the 1990s, a concerted effort was undertaken to help save the wild yak population.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Yak_in_Nepal.jpg/250px-Yak_in_Nepal.jpg
