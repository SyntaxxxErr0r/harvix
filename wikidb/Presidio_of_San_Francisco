55.5	Presidio_of_San_Francisco	Presidio of San Francisco	The Presidio of San Francisco (originally, El Presidio Real de San Francisco or Royal Presidio of San Francisco) is a park on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula in San Francisco, California, within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. It has been a fortified location since September 17th, 1776 when New Spain made it the military center of their colonization of the area. It passed to Mexico, which in turn passed it to the United States in 1848. As part of a military reduction program, Congress voted in 1989 to end the Presidio's status as an active military installation and on October 1, 1994, it was transferred to the National Park Service, ending 219 years of military use and beginning its next phase of mixed commercial and public use. In 1996, the United States Congress created the Presidio Trust to oversee and manage the interior 80% of the park's lands, with the National Park Service managing the coastal 20%. In a first-of-its-kind structure, Congress mandated that the Presidio Trust make the Presidio financially self-sufficient by 2013, which it achieved 8 years early.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Prsf_Presidio_map.jpg/250px-Prsf_Presidio_map.jpg
