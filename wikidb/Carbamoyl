2.10	Carbamoyl	Carbamic acid	Carbamic acid is a compound that is unstable under normal circumstances. It is technically the simplest amino acid, though its instability (and the unique nature of the carboxyl-nitrogen bond) allows glycine to assume this title. Its importance is due more to its relevance in identifying the names of larger compounds. Carbamic acid itself has not been synthesized or characterized by any experimental technique.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Carbamins%C3%A4ure.svg/115px-Carbamins%C3%A4ure.svg.png
