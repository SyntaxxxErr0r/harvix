13.43	Carousel_(film)	Carousel (film)	Carousel is a 1956 film adaptation of the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of the same name which, in turn, was based on Ferenc Moln√°r's non-musical play Liliom. The 1956 Carousel film stars Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones, and was directed by Henry King. Like the original stage production, the film contains what many critics consider some of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most beautiful songs, as well as what may be, along with the plots of Allegro and South Pacific, the most serious storyline found in their musicals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Carousel_film_1956.jpg/220px-Carousel_film_1956.jpg
