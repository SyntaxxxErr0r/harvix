125.1	Perseids	Perseids	The Perseids ( ) are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Swift-Tuttle. The Perseids are so-called because the point from which they appear to come, called the radiant, lies in the constellation Perseus. The name derives in part from the word Perseides (Περσείδες), a term found in Greek mythology referring to the sons of Perseus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/The_2010_Perseids_over_the_VLT.jpg/250px-The_2010_Perseids_over_the_VLT.jpg
