Pueblos indígenas (indigenous peoples) is a common term in Spanish-speaking countries. Aborígen (aboriginal/native) is used in Argentina, while "Amerindian" is used in Guyana, but not commonly used in other countries. Indigenous peoples are known in Canada as Aboriginal peoples, and in the United States as Native Americans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/NSRW_Natives_of_North_America.png/220px-NSRW_Natives_of_North_America.png
