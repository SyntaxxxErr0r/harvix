76.1	Infinite_Loop_(street)	Infinite Loop (street)	Infinite Loop is a street encircling the six main buildings of Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. Each building has a number which corresponds to its single-digit address on the Loop, and so Apple's official mailing address is "1 Infinite Loop". The numbers increment in the clockwise direction. Employees often refer to the buildings as IL1 through IL6 . The loop connects to Mariani Avenue, which was the former street address of Apple HQ; early printed material contains the address "20525 Mariani Avenue," which is the address of a building that still stands directly across on the other side of De Anza Boulevard.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Apple_Campus_One_Infinite_Loop_Sign.jpg/250px-Apple_Campus_One_Infinite_Loop_Sign.jpg
