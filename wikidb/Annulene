1.10	Annulene	Annulene	Annulenes are completely conjugated monocyclic hydrocarbons. They have the general formula CnHn (when n is an even number) or CnHn+1 (when n is an odd number). The IUPAC naming conventions are that annulenes with 7 or more carbon atoms are named as annulene, where n is the number of carbon atoms in their ring, though sometimes the smaller annulenes are referred to using the same notation, and benzene is sometimes referred to simply as annulene.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Benzene_bonds.svg/220px-Benzene_bonds.svg.png
