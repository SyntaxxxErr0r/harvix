2.00	Billystick	Baton (law enforcement)	A truncheon or baton (also called a cosh, Paddy wacker, billystick, billy club, nightstick, sap, blackjack, stick) is essentially a club of less than arm's length made of wood, plastic, or metal. They are carried for forced compliance and self-defense purposes by law-enforcement officers, correctional staff, security-industry employees and (less often) military personnel. Other uses for truncheons and batons include crowd control or the dispersal of belligerent or non-compliant targets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Batong%2C_Nordisk_familjebok.png/220px-Batong%2C_Nordisk_familjebok.png
