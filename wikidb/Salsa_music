70.0	Salsa_music	Salsa music	Salsa music is a general term referring to what is essentially Cuban popular dance music created outside of Cuba. Salsa was initially recorded, promoted and marketed in New York City during the 1970s. The various musical genres comprising salsa include the Cuban son montuno, guaracha, chachach√°, mambo, bolero and, to a lesser degree, non-Cuban genres such as the Puerto Rican bomba and plena, the Dominican merengue, and the Colombian cumbia. Latin jazz, which was also created in New York City, has had a significant influence on salsa arrangers and instrumental soloists. Salsa occasionally incorporates elements from North American rock, R&amp;B, and funk. All of these non-Cuban elements are grafted onto the basic Cuban son montuno template when performed within the context of salsa.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Salsa_dance_pattern.png/300px-Salsa_dance_pattern.png
