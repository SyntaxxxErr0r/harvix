4.20	Daphne_laureola	Daphne laureola	Daphne laureola, or Spurge-laurel (or Daphne-laurel, laurel-leaved daphne, olive-spurge, wood laurel, copse laurel), is a species of Daphne in the flowering plant family Thymelaeaceae. Despite the name, this woodland plant is neither a spurge nor a laurel but is one of the two species of Daphne native to Britain - the other being Daphne mezereum both of which have a strong preference for alkaline soils and are most commonly found in limestone areas . However, unlike Mezereon, D. laureola is an evergreen with yellowish green flowers borne very early in the Spring and black berries, which are poisonous to humans but not to birds, present from late Summer. All parts of the plants are poisonous. The sap is known to cause skin rashes on contact.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Daphne_laureola_8703.jpg/220px-Daphne_laureola_8703.jpg
