93.4	Lenticular_printing	Lenticular printing	Lenticular printing is a technology in which a lenticular lens is used to produce images with an illusion of depth, or the ability to change or move as the image is viewed from different angles. Examples of lenticular printing include prizes given in Cracker Jack snack boxes that showed flip and animation effects such as winking eyes, and modern advertising graphics that change their message depending on the viewing angle. This technology was created in the 1940s but has evolved in recent years to show more motion and increased depth. Originally used mostly in novelty items and commonly called "flicker pictures" or "wiggle pictures," lenticular prints are now being used as a marketing tool to show products in motion. Recent advances in large-format presses have allowed for oversized lenses to be used in lithographic lenticular printing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Close_up_of_the_surface_of_a_lenticular_print.jpg/330px-Close_up_of_the_surface_of_a_lenticular_print.jpg
