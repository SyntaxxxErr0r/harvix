1.10	Fort_Le_Jonquiere	Fort La Jonquière	Fort La Jonquière was established in 1751 as part of the western commanders continued search for a route to the western sea. The commander at that time was Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, who had replaced Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La Vérendrye, and there is no doubt that he did send expeditions up the Saskatchewan River. One account has a party building the fort on the Bow River near modern day Calgary. The more prevalent wisdom has it being established at, or near, the junction of the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers (see Saskatchewan River Forks). Another suggestion is Nipawin, Saskatchewan.. In any case, there was a further expansion of the French influence into the west during that period and it definitely reached the forks of the two Saskatchewan rivers..
