63.9	Esther	Esther	Esther (Hebrew: , Modern Tiberian ), born Hadassah, is the eponymous heroine of the Biblical Book of Esther. According to the Bible, she was a Jewish queen of the Persian king Ahasuerus. While Ahasuerus was traditionally identified with Xerxes I during the time of the Achaemenid empire, many historians now believe that Esther was the queen of Persia under a later king of Persia, during the time of the Sassanid empire. Her story is the basis for the celebration of Purim in Jewish tradition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Esther_haram.jpg/285px-Esther_haram.jpg
