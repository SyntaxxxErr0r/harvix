It was organized and trained by a Spanish police mission sent to Peru at that time. It was not a detective force, investigations being carried out by the Investigative Police of Peru founded in the same year, while the old Republican Guard still had certain police missions. The Civil Guard was later renamed the General Police, which merged into the new National Police of Peru in 1988.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Emblema2GCP.jpg/140px-Emblema2GCP.jpg
