57.7	Southern_Europe	Southern Europe	The term Southern Europe, at its most general definition, is used to mean "all countries in the south of Europe". However, the concept, at different times, has had different meanings, providing additional political, linguistic and cultural context to the definition in addition to the typical geographical, phytogeographic or climatic approach. Most coastal countries in the United Nations-designated southern Europe border the Mediterranean Sea. Exceptions are Portugal which has only Atlantic coastline, Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia, which are landlocked, and Bulgaria, which borders the Black Sea.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/MapLab-Southern_Europe.svg/300px-MapLab-Southern_Europe.svg.png
