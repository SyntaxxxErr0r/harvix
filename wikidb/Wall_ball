"Red Butt," "Blackjack," "wallball" "Slaughterhouse," "Fumble," "Butt Ball," "Asses Up," "Suicides," "Stitch," "Peg," "Fire in the Bum," "A-Ball," "Buns Up," "Booties Up", "No Fear," "Red Bum," "Red Ass," "Sting," "Error", "Off the Wall","Kirby", or "Burn") is a North American elementary school children’s playground game originating in the 1950s or earlier. It is slightly similar to the game Screen Ball. Butts Up or Booties Up began in the 40s or 50s as a penalty phase of various city street games. Butts Up is played with a ball (such as a tennis ball or racquetball) on a paved surface against a wall, with a variable number of participants—usually more than three and often likely to exceed ten. Butts Up tends to be played during recess or after school; it is played infrequently before school. The game is co-ed, although in practice its aggressive nature attracts mostly boys. Popular in New England is another frequent variation of 'Wall Ball' that usually differs a lot from the more widely known 'Butts Up'.
