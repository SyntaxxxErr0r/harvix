54.9	Cannon	Cannon	A cannon is any piece of artillery that uses gunpowder or other usually explosive-based propellents to launch a projectile. Cannon vary in caliber, range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word cannon is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube, cane, or reed. The plural of cannon is cannon, the same word, or more commonly in America, cannons. In modern times, cannon has fallen out of common usage, usually replaced by "guns" or "artillery", if not a more specific term, such as "mortar" or "howitzer". In aviation, 'cannon' remains a common term for aircraft guns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Cannon%2C_Ch%C3%A2teau_du_Haut-Koenigsbourg%2C_France.jpg/200px-Cannon%2C_Ch%C3%A2teau_du_Haut-Koenigsbourg%2C_France.jpg
