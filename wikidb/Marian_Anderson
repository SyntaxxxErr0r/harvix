58.0	Marian_Anderson	Marian Anderson	Marian Anderson (February 27, 1897 â€“ April 8, 1993) was an African-American contralto and one of the most celebrated singers of the twentieth century. Music critic Alan Blyth said "Her voice was a rich, vibrant contralto of intrinsic beauty." Most of her singing career was spent performing in concert and recital in major music venues and with major orchestras throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965. Although she was offered contracts to perform roles with many important European opera companies, Anderson declined all of these. She preferred to perform in concert and recital only. She did, however, perform opera arias within her concerts and recitals. She made many recordings that reflected her broad performance repertoire of everything from concert literature to lieder to opera to traditional American songs and spirituals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Marian_Anderson.jpg/300px-Marian_Anderson.jpg
