1.00	HMS_Hindustan_(1903)	HMS Hindustan (1903)	HMS Hindustan was a King Edward VII class pre-dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy. Like all ships of the class (apart from HMS King Edward VII) she was named after an important part of the British Empire, namely the Indian Empire. Commissioned in mid 1905, she served with firstly the Atlantic Fleet and then the Channel Fleet. When the latter fleet was reorganised to the Home Fleet, she was attached to that fleet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/HMS_Hindustan.jpg/300px-HMS_Hindustan.jpg
