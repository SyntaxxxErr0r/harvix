104.7	Vitiligo	Vitiligo	Vitiligo ( ) is a condition that causes depigmentation of sections of skin. It occurs when melanocytes, the cells responsible for skin pigmentation, die or are unable to function. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but research suggests that it may arise from autoimmune, genetic, oxidative stress, neural, or viral causes. The incidence worldwide is less than 1%. The most common form is non-segmental vitiligo, which tends to appear in symmetric patches, sometimes over large areas of the body.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Vitiligo2.JPG/230px-Vitiligo2.JPG
