52.4	Loyalist_(American_Revolution)	Loyalist (American Revolution)	Loyalists were American colonists who remained loyal to the Kingdom of Great Britain (and the British monarchy) during the American Revolutionary War. At the time they were often called Tories, Royalists, or King's Men. They were opposed by the Patriots, those who supported the revolution. When their cause was defeated, about 20% of the Loyalists fled to other parts of the British Empire, in Britain or elsewhere in British North America, especially Ontario and New Brunswick, where they were called United Empire Loyalists. Most were compensated with Canadian land or British cash distributed through formal claims procedures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Reception_of_the_American_Loyalists.jpg/300px-Reception_of_the_American_Loyalists.jpg
