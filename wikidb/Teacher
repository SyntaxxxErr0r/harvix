161.3	Teacher	Teacher	A teacher or schoolteacher is a person who provides education for pupils (children) and students (adults). The role of teacher is often formal and ongoing, carried out at a school or other place of formal education. In many countries, a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain specified professional qualifications or credentials from a university or college. These professional qualifications may include the study of pedagogy, the science of teaching. Teachers, like other professionals, may have to continue their education after they qualify, a process known as continuing professional development. Teachers may use a lesson plan to facilitate student learning, providing a course of study which is called the curriculum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Classroom_at_a_seconday_school_in_Pendembu_Sierra_Leone.jpg/250px-Classroom_at_a_seconday_school_in_Pendembu_Sierra_Leone.jpg
