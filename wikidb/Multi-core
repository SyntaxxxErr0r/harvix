54.6	Multi-core	Multi-core processor	A multi-core processor is a single computing component with two or more independent actual processors (called "cores"), which are the units that read and execute program instructions. The instructions are ordinary CPU instructions such as add, move data, and branch, but the multiple cores can run multiple instructions at the same time, increasing overall speed for programs amenable to parallel computing. Manufacturers typically integrate the cores onto a single integrated circuit die (known as a chip multiprocessor or CMP), or onto multiple dies in a single chip package.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Dual_Core_Generic.svg/190px-Dual_Core_Generic.svg.png
