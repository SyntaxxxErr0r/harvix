103.6	Ska	Ska	Ska ( , Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s, and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Skank_on_Em64.png/350px-Skank_on_Em64.png
