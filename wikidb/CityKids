3.20	CityKids	CityKids	CityKids is a television series that aired late Saturday Mornings on ABC from 1993 to 1994. The show consists primarily of live action performances, interspersed with Muppet segments, courtesy of Jim Henson Productions. These Muppets are composed of original characters designed specifically for the show, not ones taken from Sesame Street or The Muppet Show. These original characters often serve as the Greek chorus for the show, commenting on the situations of the human characters, but not actually interacting with them.
