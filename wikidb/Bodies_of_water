6.22	Bodies_of_water	Body of water	A body of water or waterbody (often spelled water body) is any significant accumulation of water, usually covering the Earth or another planet. The term body of water most often refers to large accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it may also include smaller pools of water such as ponds, puddles or wetlands. Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are not considered bodies of water. However, there is no other term in English comprising "stationary" bodies of water as well as rivers and canals etc., and such moving bodies of water are included in this article.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Lysefjorden_fjord.jpg/250px-Lysefjorden_fjord.jpg
