1.00	Bird_watcher	Birdwatching	Birdwatching or birding is the observation of birds as a recreational activity. It can be done with the naked eye, through a visual enhancement device like binoculars and telescopes, or by listening for bird sounds. Birding often involves a significant auditory component, as many bird species are more readily detected and identified by ear than by eye. Most birdwatchers pursue this activity mainly for recreational or social reasons, unlike ornithologists, who engage in the study of birds using more formal scientific methods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/PeopleBirding.JPG/250px-PeopleBirding.JPG
