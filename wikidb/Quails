3.00	Quails	Quail	Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds generally considered in the order Galliformes. Old World quail are found in the family Phasianidae, while New World quail are found in the family Odontophoridae. The buttonquail are not quail at all, are named more for their appearance superficially resembling quail, and are members of the Turnicidae family, more closely related to the Charadriiformes. The King Quail, a member of the Old World quail, is often sold in the pet trade and is commonly referred to there as a "button quail". Many of the common larger species are farm raised for table food or egg consumption, and are hunted on game farms or in the wild, where they are sometimes artificially stocked to supplement the wild population, or extend into areas they are normally not found naturally.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Brown_Quail.jpg/250px-Brown_Quail.jpg
