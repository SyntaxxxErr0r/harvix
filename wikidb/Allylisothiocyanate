1.00	Allylisothiocyanate	Allyl isothiocyanate	Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is the organosulfur compound with the formula CH2CHCH2NCS. This colorless oil is responsible for the pungent taste of mustard, horseradish, and wasabi. This pungency and the lachrymatory effect of AITC is mediated through the TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels. It is slightly soluble in water, but well soluble in most organic solvents.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Allyl-isothiocyanate-2D-skeletal.png/120px-Allyl-isothiocyanate-2D-skeletal.png
