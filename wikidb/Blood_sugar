125.2	Blood_sugar	Blood sugar	The blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. Normally in mammals, the body maintains the blood glucose level at a reference range between about 3.6 and 5.8 mM (mmol/L, i.e., millimoles/liter), or 64.8 and 104.4 mg/dL. The human body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Suckale08_fig3_glucose_insulin_day.jpg/400px-Suckale08_fig3_glucose_insulin_day.jpg
