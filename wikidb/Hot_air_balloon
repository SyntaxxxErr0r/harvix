On November 21, 1783, in Paris, France, the first untethered manned flight was made by Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent d'Arlandes in a hot air balloon created on December 14, 1782 by the Montgolfier brothers. Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than just being pushed along by the wind are known as airships or, more specifically, thermal airships.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Mid-Hudson_balloon_festival_9.JPG/250px-Mid-Hudson_balloon_festival_9.JPG
