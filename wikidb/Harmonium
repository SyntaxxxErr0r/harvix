73.4	Harmonium	Harmonium	A harmonium is a free-standing keyboard instrument similar to a reed organ. Sound is produced by air being blown through sets of free reeds, resulting in a sound similar to that of an accordion. The air is usually supplied by bellows operated by the foot, hand, or knees.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Harmonium2.jpg/250px-Harmonium2.jpg
