12.62	Wheatfield_with_Crows	Wheatfield with Crows	Wheatfield with Crows is a July 1890 painting by Vincent van Gogh. It is commonly stated that this was van Gogh's last painting. However, art historians are uncertain as to which painting was van Gogh's last, as no clear historical records exist. The evidence of his letters suggests that Wheatfield with Crows was completed around 10 July and predates such paintings as Auvers Town Hall on 14 July 1890 and Daubigny's Garden. Moreover, Jan Hulsker points out that a painting of harvested wheat, Field with Stacks of Wheat (F771), must be a later painting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/A_Vincent_Van_Gogh.jpg/500px-A_Vincent_Van_Gogh.jpg
