2.00	Kansas-Nebraska_Bill_of_1854	Kansas–Nebraska Act	The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 (10 Stat. 277) created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska, opening new lands for settlement, and had the effect of repealing the Missouri Compromise of 1820 by allowing settlers in those territories to determine through Popular Sovereignty whether they would allow slavery within each territory. The act was designed by Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. The initial purpose of the Kansas–Nebraska Act was to open up many thousands of new farms and make feasible a Midwestern Transcontinental Railroad. It became problematic when popular sovereignty was written into the proposal so that the voters of the moment would decide whether slavery would be allowed. The result was that pro- and anti-slavery elements flooded into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down, leading to a bloody civil war there.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Reynolds%27s_Political_Map_of_the_United_States_1856.jpg/400px-Reynolds%27s_Political_Map_of_the_United_States_1856.jpg
