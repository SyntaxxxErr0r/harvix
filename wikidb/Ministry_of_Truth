78.6	Ministry_of_Truth	Ministry of Truth	The Ministry of Truth (or Minitrue, in Newspeak) is one of the four ministries that govern Oceania in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. As with the other Ministries in the novel, the Ministry of Truth is a misnomer and in reality serves an opposing purpose to that which its name would imply, being responsible for the falsification of historical events; and yet is aptly named in a deeper sense, in that it creates/manufactures "truth" in the newspeak sense of the word.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Senate_House_UoL.jpg/220px-Senate_House_UoL.jpg
