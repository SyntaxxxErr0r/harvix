78.8	Afrikaans	Afrikaans	Afrikaans is a West Germanic language, spoken natively in South Africa, Namibia and to a lesser extent in Botswana and Zimbabwe. It originates from 17th century Dutch dialects of the mainly Dutch settlers, that further developed in South Africa. Hence, historically, it is a daughter language of Dutch, and was previously referred to as "Cape Dutch" (a term also used to refer collectively to the early Cape settlers).n 2 Although Afrikaans adopted words from languages such as Malay, Portuguese, the Bantu languages, and the Khoisan languages, an estimated 90 to 95 percent of Afrikaans vocabulary is ultimately of Dutch origin.n 3 Therefore, differences with Dutch often lie in a more regular morphology, grammar, and spelling of Afrikaans.n 4 There is a large degree of mutual intelligibility between the two languages—especially in written form—although it is easier for Dutch-speakers to understand Afrikaans than the other way around.n 5	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Afrikaans_ETN15_Spread.svg/300px-Afrikaans_ETN15_Spread.svg.png
