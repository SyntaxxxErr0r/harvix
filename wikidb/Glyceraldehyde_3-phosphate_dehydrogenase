6.80	Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate_dehydrogenase	Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase	Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (abbreviated as GAPDH or less commonly as G3PDH) is an enzyme of ~37kDa that catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis and thus serves to break down glucose for energy and carbon molecules. In addition to this long established metabolic function, GAPDH has recently been implicated in several non-metabolic processes, including transcription activation, initiation of apoptosis, and ER to Golgi vesicle shuttling.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/GAPDH_with_labels.png/250px-GAPDH_with_labels.png
