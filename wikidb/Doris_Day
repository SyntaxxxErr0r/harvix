91.5	Doris_Day	Doris Day	Doris Day (born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff; April 3, 1924) is an American actress, singer, and animal rights activist. With an entertainment career that spanned through almost 50 years, Day started her career as a big band singer in 1939, but only began to be noticed after her first hit recording, "Sentimental Journey", in 1945. After leaving Les Brown's Band of Renown to try a solo career, she started her long-lasting partnership with Columbia Records, which would remain her only recording label. The contract lasted from 1947 to 1967, and produced more than 650 recordings, making Day one of the most popular and acclaimed singers of the 20th century. In 1948, after being persuaded by Sammy Cahn, Jule Styne and her agent at the time, Al Levy, she auditioned for Michael Curtiz, which led to the lead role in Romance on the High Seas, her first film with close friend, Jack Carson.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Day-midnightlace.jpg/220px-Day-midnightlace.jpg
