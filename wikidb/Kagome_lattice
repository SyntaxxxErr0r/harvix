6.01	Kagome_lattice	Kagome lattice	A kagome lattice is an arrangement of laths composed of interlaced triangles such that each point where two laths cross has four neighboring points. Although called a lattice, it is more closely related to the trihexagonal tiling than to a mathematical lattice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Tile_3636.svg/220px-Tile_3636.svg.png
