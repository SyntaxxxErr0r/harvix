2.00	Ain't_Too_Proud_To_Beg	Ain't Too Proud to Beg	"Ain't Too Proud to Beg" is a 1966 song and hit single by The Temptations for Motown Records' Gordy label, produced by Norman Whitfield and written by Whitfield and Edward Holland, Jr. The song peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Pop Chart, and was a number-one hit on the Billboard R&amp;B charts for eight non-consecutive weeks. The song's success, in the wake of the relative underperformance of the previous Temptations single, "Get Ready", resulted in Norman Whitfield replacing Smokey Robinson, producer of "Get Ready", as The Temptations' main producer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/Tempts-ain%27t-too-proud.jpg/220px-Tempts-ain%27t-too-proud.jpg
