2.10	Research_chemicals	Designer drug	Designer drug is a term used to describe drugs that are created (or marketed, if they had already existed) so as to avoid the provisions of existing drug laws, usually by preparing analogs or derivatives of existing drugs by modifying their chemical structure to varying degrees, or less commonly by finding drugs with entirely different chemical structures that produce similar subjective effects to illegal recreational drugs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Pyschoactive_Drugs.jpg/110px-Pyschoactive_Drugs.jpg
