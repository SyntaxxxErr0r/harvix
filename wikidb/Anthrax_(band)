73.7	Anthrax_(band)	Anthrax (band)	Anthrax is an American heavy metal band from New York City, formed in 1981. Founded by guitarists Scott Ian and Danny Lilker, the band has since released ten studio albums and 20 singles, and an EP featuring Public Enemy. The band was one of the most popular of the 1980s thrash metal scene. When thrash metal began to gain a major following in the mid-to-late 1980s, Anthrax were dubbed one of the "big four" of thrash metal alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. They were also one of the early thrash metal bands to sign to a major label (Island Records, in 1985).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/AnthraxSonisphere2010.jpg/250px-AnthraxSonisphere2010.jpg
