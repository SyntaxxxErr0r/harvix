1.00	Electrogravimetry	Electrogravimetry	Electrogravimetry is a method used to separate and quantify ions of a substance, usually a metal. In this process, the analyte solution is electrolyzed. Electrochemical reduction causes the analyte to be deposited on the cathode. The cathode is weighed before and after the experiment, and weighing by difference is used to calculate the amount of analyte in the original solution. Controlling the potential of the electrode is important to ensure that only the metal being analyzed will be deposited on the electrode.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/EG4.JPG/200px-EG4.JPG
