60.4	Replicant	Replicant	A replicant is a bioengineered or biorobotic being created in the film Blade Runner (1982). The Nexus series—genetically designed by the Tyrell Corporation—are virtually identical to an adult human, but have superior strength, agility, and variable intelligence depending on the model. Because of their physical similarity to humans, a replicant must be detected by its lack of emotional responses and empathy to questions posed in a Voight-Kampff test. A derogatory term for a replicant is "skin-job." (Note: This term reappears in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica in derogatory reference to Humanoid Cylons - who could also be considered as a type of replicant.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ac/BladeRunner_Rachael.jpg
