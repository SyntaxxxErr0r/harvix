8.00	Newcastle_West	Newcastle West	Newcastle West (Irish: ) is a town in west County Limerick, Ireland. The town is the largest town in the county, excluding Limerick city, and is sited on the River Arra which flows into the River Deel. Newcastle West sits in the centre of a large bowl shaped valley in West Limerick, known one time as the valley of the Wild Boar, apparently due to the abundance of this animal here when the area was dense with forestry. The Crest of the town carries the image of a wild pig. It is located on the N21 road from Limerick to Tralee, between Rathkeale and Abbeyfeale.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Newcastle_West%2C_The_Square.jpg/250px-Newcastle_West%2C_The_Square.jpg
