3.00	Isophysis_tasmanica	Isophysis	Isophysis is a genus of herbaceous, perennial and rhizomatous plants in the Iris family . A monotypic genus, it contains a single species, Isophysis tasmanica , endemic to the mountains of Western Tasmania growing in heathland on sandy soils. It has grass-like foliage and star-like dark red-purple or yellow flowers with reflexed tepals. A characteristic feature of this species is its superior ovary, which distinguishes it from any other member of Iridaceae. The genus name is derived from the Greek words iso, meaning "equal", and physis, meaning "bladder".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Isophysis_tasmanica.jpg/220px-Isophysis_tasmanica.jpg
