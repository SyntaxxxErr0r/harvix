Pilots are expert shiphandlers who possess indepth knowledge of local waterways. Pilots are responsible under the law and maritime custom for conducting the safe navigation of the vessel. With the exception of the Panama Canal, the pilot is only an advisor, as the captain remains in legal command of the vessel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/CRBP-_CHINOOK_2.jpg/200px-CRBP-_CHINOOK_2.jpg
