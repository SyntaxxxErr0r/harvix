79.0	Yasser_Arafat	Yasser Arafat	Mohammed Yasser Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini (Arabic: ‎‎; 24 August 1929 – 11 November 2004), popularly known as Yasser Arafat (Arabic: ‎) or by his kunya Abu Ammar (Arabic: ‎, ), was a Palestinian leader and a Laureate of the Nobel Prize. He was Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), and leader of the Fatah political party, which he founded in 1959. Arafat spent much of his life fighting against Israel in the name of Palestinian self-determination. Originally opposed to Israel's existence, he modified his position in 1988 when he accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242. Arafat and his movement operated from several Arab countries. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Fatah faced off with Jordan in a brief civil war. Forced out of Jordan and into Lebanon, Arafat and Fatah were major targets of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions of that country.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/ArafatEconomicForum.jpg/225px-ArafatEconomicForum.jpg
