73.4	Dendrochronology	Dendrochronology	Dendrochronology or tree-ring dating is the scientific method of dating based on the analysis of patterns of tree-rings. Dendrochronology can date the time at which tree rings were formed, in many types of wood, to the exact calendar year. This has three main areas of application: paleoecology, where it is used to determine certain aspects of past ecologies (most prominently climate); archaeology, where it is used to date old buildings, etc.; and radiocarbon dating, where it is used to calibrate radiocarbon ages (see below).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Dendrochronological_drill_hg.jpg/240px-Dendrochronological_drill_hg.jpg
