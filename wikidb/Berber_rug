1.00	Berber_rug	Berber carpet	Berber carpets are a modern style of carpet, distinguished by a loop pile construction type, and usually contain small flecks of dark color on lighter shades of background colors. They are typically in a plain color mix with no pattern, and are relatively cheap and durable, so popular for areas with relatively heavy use such as offices. Berber carpets are also the traditional hand-woven carpets of the Berber people of North Africa, which use a distinct knot that gives a similar appearance to a modern Berber carpet, but are brightly colored with designs that are different from other oriental rugs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Swatches_of_berber_carpet.jpg/250px-Swatches_of_berber_carpet.jpg
