The term "bespoke" is understood to have originated in Savile Row when cloth for a suit was said to "be spoken for" by individual customers. The short street is termed the "golden mile of tailoring", where customers have included Winston Churchill, Lord Nelson, Napoleon III and Mohammad Ali Jinnah.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Savile_Row_1.jpg/280px-Savile_Row_1.jpg
