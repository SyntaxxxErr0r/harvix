94.1	Parsing	Parsing	In computer science and linguistics, parsing, or, more formally, syntactic analysis, is the process of analyzing a text, made of a sequence of tokens (for example, words), to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given (more or less) formal grammar. Parsing can also be used as a linguistic term, for instance when discussing how phrases are divided up in garden path sentences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Parser_Flow.gif
