8.00	Pink_Lady_(apple)	Cripps Pink	Cripps Pink is a variety of apple, from which apples meeting quality standards can be sold under the trade mark name Pink Lady. The Cripps Pink variety was originally bred by John Cripps at the (then named) Western Australia Department of Agriculture by crossing the Australian apple Lady Williams with a Golden Delicious in order to combine the best features of both apples. The apple is both sweet and crisp.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Pink_lady_and_cross_section.jpg/250px-Pink_lady_and_cross_section.jpg
