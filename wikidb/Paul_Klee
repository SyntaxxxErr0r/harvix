79.1	Paul_Klee	Paul Klee	Paul Klee , published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are considered so important for modern art that they are compared to the importance that Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting had for Renaissance. He and his colleague, the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the German Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture. His works reflect his dry humour and his sometimes childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Paul_Klee_1911.jpg/220px-Paul_Klee_1911.jpg
