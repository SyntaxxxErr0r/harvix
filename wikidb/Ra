98.1	Ra	Ra	Ra (alternatively spelled Re and properly transliterated as ) is the ancient Egyptian sun god. By the Fifth Dynasty he had become a major deity in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the midday sun. The meaning of the name is uncertain, but it is thought that if not a word for 'sun' it may be a variant of or linked to words meaning 'creative power' and 'creator'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Re-Horakhty.svg/220px-Re-Horakhty.svg.png
