1.22	CloudMade	CloudMade	CloudMade is a company which produces APIs, rendered maps, and geographic-related services. Unlike many other companies in the same field, CloudMade uses exclusively Creative Commons-licensed OpenStreetMap data, and was cofounded by the founder of OpenStreetMap, Steve Coast. Many of its products compete with Google Maps by providing APIs for web sites, applications, and devices to use the rendered map data.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8d/CM_logo.svg/200px-CM_logo.svg.png
