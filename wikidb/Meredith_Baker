1.00	Meredith_Baker	Meredith Attwell Baker	Meredith Attwell Baker was a member of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In mid-May 2011, she announced that she was taking a job with Comcast, effective June 3, 2011, instead of completing her term on June 30. The change, so soon after approving the Comcast NBC merger, garnered significant criticism and a possible House investigation concerning the "revolving door" between the regulator and the regulated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Meredith_Attwell_Baker.jpg
