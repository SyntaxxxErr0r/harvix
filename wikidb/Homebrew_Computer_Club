125.0	Homebrew_Computer_Club	Homebrew Computer Club	The Homebrew Computer Club was an early computer hobbyist users' group in Silicon Valley, which met (under that name) from March 5, 1975 to December 1986. Several very high-profile hackers and IT entrepreneurs emerged from its ranks, including the founders of Apple Inc. The short-lived newsletter they published was instrumental in creating the technological culture of Silicon Valley. The influence of the club was depicted in the made-for-television movie Pirates of Silicon Valley.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Homebrew_Computer_Club_Sep1976.png/220px-Homebrew_Computer_Club_Sep1976.png
