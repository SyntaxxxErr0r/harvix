2.00	Pet%C3%A4j%C3%A4rvi	Petrovskoye, Leningrad Oblast	Petrovskoye (Finnish: ; Russian: ) is a rural locality on Karelian Isthmus, in Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast. Before the Winter War and Continuation War, Pet채j채rvi was a prosperous village of the Sakkola municipality of the Viipuri province of Finland. In 1948, after the war, Pet채j채rvi was renamed to Petrovskoye, but the railway station of the Saint Petersburg-Hiitola railroad serving it retained its name, as there had already been another station with the name Petrovskoye in Leningrad Oblast.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Petajarvi.jpg/300px-Petajarvi.jpg
