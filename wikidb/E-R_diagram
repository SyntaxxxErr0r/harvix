1.10	E-R_diagram	Entity-relationship model	In software engineering, an entity-relationship model (ER model for short) is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity-relationship modeling is a database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion. Diagrams created by this process are called entity-relationship diagrams or ER diagrams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/ER_Diagram_MMORPG.png/320px-ER_Diagram_MMORPG.png
