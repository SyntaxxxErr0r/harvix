55.4	Quantum_tunneling	Quantum tunnelling	Quantum tunnelling refers to the quantum mechanical phenomenon where a particle tunnels through a barrier that it classically could not surmount. This plays an essential role in several physical phenomena, such as the nuclear fusion that occurs in main sequence stars like the sun, and has important applications to modern devices such as the tunnel diode. The effect was predicted in the early 20th century and its acceptance, as a general physical phenomenon, came mid-century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/TunnelEffektKling1.png/300px-TunnelEffektKling1.png
