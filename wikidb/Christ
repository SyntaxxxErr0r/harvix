168.9	Christ	Christ	Christ (Greek (Khristós) 'anointed') is a translation of the Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ (Māšîaḥ), the Messiah. The translation appears in the Septuagint version of the Hebrew Bible which predates Christianity by over a century, but in the New Testament it is used to refer to Jesus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Spas_vsederzhitel_sinay.jpg/200px-Spas_vsederzhitel_sinay.jpg
