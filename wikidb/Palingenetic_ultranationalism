12.61	Palingenetic_ultranationalism	Palingenetic ultranationalism	Palingenetic ultranationalism is a theory concerning generic fascism formulated by British political theorist Roger Griffin. The key elements are that fascism can be defined by its core myth, namely that of "national rebirth" â€” palingenesis. Griffin argues that the unique synthesis of palingenesis and ultranationalism differentiates fascism from para-fascism and other authoritarian nationalist ideologies. This is what he calls the "fascist minimum" without which there is no fascism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Italian_Fascist_flag_1930s-1940s.svg/150px-Italian_Fascist_flag_1930s-1940s.svg.png
