15.23	Pontiac_V8_engine	Pontiac V8 engine	Pontiac began as a adjunct to the Oakland division of the General Motors line of automobiles in 1926. Pontiac successfully competed against more expensive 4-cylinder models with their inline flathead 6 engines. After outselling Oakland, Pontiac became the sole survivor of the two by 1932. In addition to the inline 6, Pontiac also had an inline 8 by 1933. These two engines were used through 1954, when Pontiac unveiled its V8 in 1955. From 1955 to 1981 the Pontiac Division of General Motors manufactured its own engines, distinct from Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, or Oldsmobile. Displacement began at 287 cu in and grew as large as 455 cu.in. (7.5 L) by 1970.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Pontiac_Tripower.jpg/250px-Pontiac_Tripower.jpg
