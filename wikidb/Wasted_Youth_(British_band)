The line-up of the band was Ken Scott (vocals and guitar), Rocco Barker (guitar), Nick Nicole (synth), Darren Murphy (bass) and Andy Scott (drums). Their records were released through Bridgehouse Records, a label set up by the bass player's father in the pub he owned in Canning Town.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b1/Wasted_Youth_%28British_band%29.jpg
