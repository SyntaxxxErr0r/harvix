Over the years they raised funds and decided, with South Sydney City Council, on the site at Green Park in Darlinghurst, in Sydney, Australia. Darlinghurst is considered the heart of Sydney's gay and lesbian population. Green Park is adjacent to the Sydney Jewish Museum, which ensures that the memorial retains its historic meaning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Pink_Triangle_Sydney%2C.jpg/250px-Pink_Triangle_Sydney%2C.jpg
