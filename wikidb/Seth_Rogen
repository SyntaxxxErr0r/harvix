76.7	Seth_Rogen	Seth Rogen	Seth Rogen is a Canadian stand-up comedian, actor, producer, screenwriter, and voice artist. Rogen began his career doing stand-up comedy during his teen years, winning the Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest in 1998. While still living in his native Vancouver, he landed a small part in Freaks and Geeks. Shortly after Rogen moved to Los Angeles for his role, Freaks and Geeks was canceled after one season due to poor ratings. He then got a part on the equally short-lived Undeclared, which also hired him as a staff writer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Seth_Rogen_TIFF_2011.jpg/220px-Seth_Rogen_TIFF_2011.jpg
