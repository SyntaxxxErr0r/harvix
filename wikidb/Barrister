57.4	Barrister	Barrister	A barrister is a member of one of the two classes of lawyer found in many common law jurisdictions with split legal professions. Barristers specialise in courtroom advocacy, drafting legal pleadings and giving expert legal opinions. They can be contrasted with solicitors – the other class of lawyer in split professions – who have more direct access with clients, and may do transactional-type legal work. Barristers are rarely hired by clients directly but instead are retained (or instructed) by solicitors to act on behalf of clients.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Advokat%2C_Fransk_advokatdr%C3%A4kt%2C_Nordisk_familjebok.png/220px-Advokat%2C_Fransk_advokatdr%C3%A4kt%2C_Nordisk_familjebok.png
