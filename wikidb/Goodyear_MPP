7.10	Goodyear_MPP	Goodyear MPP	The Goodyear Massively Parallel Processor was a massively parallel processing supercomputer built by Goodyear Aerospace for the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. It was designed to deliver enormous computational power at lower cost than other existing supercomputer architectures, by using thousands of simple processing elements, rather than one or a few highly complex CPUs. Development of the MPP began circa 1979; it was delivered in May 1983, and was in general use from 1985 until 1991.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Goodyear_MPP.jpg/220px-Goodyear_MPP.jpg
