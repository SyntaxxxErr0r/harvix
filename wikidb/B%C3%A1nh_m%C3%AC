113.8	B%C3%A1nh_m%C3%AC	Bánh mì	Bánh mì or bánh mỳ is a Vietnamese term for all kinds of bread. Bread, or more specifically the baguette, was introduced by the French during its colonial period. The bread most commonly found in Vietnam is single serve and resembles a torpedo, therefore the term bánh mì is synonymous with this type of bread. The bánh mì is usually more airy than its western counterpart, so as a result, has a thinner crust.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/B%C3%A1nh_m%C3%AC_th%E1%BB%8Bt_n%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bng.png/200px-B%C3%A1nh_m%C3%AC_th%E1%BB%8Bt_n%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bng.png
