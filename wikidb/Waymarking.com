1.00	Waymarking.com	Waymarking	A waymark serves to document a location (or an object at a location) that fits within a specific well-defined category. Waymarks are created by contributors who visit a location, take pictures of the object at that location (and/or the surrounding area), obtain coordinates for the location using a handheld GPS device, and later submit this information (along with additional descriptive information) to the Waymarking.com web site, specifically targeting the waymark to a particular waymarking category. Each waymarking category has its own group of volunteer reviewers, and submitted waymarks are reviewed by a group member who checks the submission for fit and completeness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/49MileScenicDrive.jpg/220px-49MileScenicDrive.jpg
