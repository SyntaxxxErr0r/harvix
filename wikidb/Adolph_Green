27.06	Adolph_Green	Adolph Green	Adolph Green (December 2, 1914 â€“ October 23, 2002) was an American lyricist and playwright who, with long-time collaborator Betty Comden, penned the screenplays and songs for some of the most beloved movie musicals, particularly as part of Arthur Freed's production unit at MGM, during the genre's heyday. Many people thought the pair were married; they were not, but they shared a unique comic genius and sophisticated wit that enabled them to forge a six-decade-long partnership that produced some of Hollywood and Broadway's greatest hits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Betty_Comden_and_Adolph_Green.jpg/220px-Betty_Comden_and_Adolph_Green.jpg
