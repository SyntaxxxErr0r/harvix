63.1	Stochastic	Stochastic	Stochastic (from the Greek στόχος for aim or guess) refers to systems whose behavior is intrinsically non-deterministic, sporadic and categorically NOT intermittent. A stochastic process is one whose behavior is non-deterministic, in that a system's subsequent state is determined both by the process's predictable actions and by a random element. However, according to M. Kac and E. Nelson, any kind of time development (be it deterministic or essentially probabilistic) which is analyzable in terms of probability deserves the name of stochastic process.
