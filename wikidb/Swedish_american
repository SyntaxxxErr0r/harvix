1.00	Swedish_american	Swedish American	Swedish Americans are Americans of Swedish descent, especially the descendants of about 1.2 million immigrants from Sweden during 1885-1915. Most were Lutherans who were affiliated with predecessor bodies of what are now the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) or Lurtheran Church- Missouri Synod or North American Lutheran Church (NALC); some were Methodists. Historically Swedish Americans are concentrated in the Midwest, roughly in the area west and northwest of Chicago.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Nothnagle_Log_House.JPG/220px-Nothnagle_Log_House.JPG
