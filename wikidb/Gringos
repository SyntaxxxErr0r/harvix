2.10	Gringos	Gringo	Gringo is a slang Spanish and Portuguese word used in Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America, to denote foreigners, often from the United States. The term can be applied to someone who is actually a foreigner, or it can denote a strong association or assimilation into foreign (particularly US) society and culture. While in Spanish it simply identifies a foreigner, without any negative connotation, in English the word is often considered offensive or disparaging.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Three_Gringos_by_Richard_Harding_Davis_1896.jpg/220px-Three_Gringos_by_Richard_Harding_Davis_1896.jpg
