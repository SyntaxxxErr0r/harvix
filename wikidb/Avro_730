3.01	Avro_730	Avro 730	The Avro 730 was a planned Mach 3 reconnaissance aircraft and bomber for the Royal Air Force. If it had proceeded into service, the aircraft would have replaced the V bombers as the primary delivery system for Britain's nuclear deterrent. It was cancelled in 1957 along with other development on manned aircraft as part of the 1957 Defence White Paper.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Avro_730.jpg/300px-Avro_730.jpg
