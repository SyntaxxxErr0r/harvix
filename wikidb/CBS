238.2	CBS	CBS	CBS Broadcasting Inc. is a major US commercial broadcasting television network, which started as a radio network. The name is derived from the initials of the network's former name, Columbia Broadcasting System. It is the second largest broadcaster in the world behind the BBC. The network is sometimes referred to as the "Eye Network" in reference to the shape of the company's logo. It has also been called the "Tiffany Network," which alludes to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of its founder William S. Paley (1901â€“90). It can also refer to some of CBS's first demonstrations of color television, which were held in a former Tiffany &amp; Co. building in New York City in 1950, thus earning it the name "Color broadcasting system" back when such a feat was innovative.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/CBS_logo.svg/200px-CBS_logo.svg.png
