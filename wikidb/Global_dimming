80.9	Global_dimming	Global dimming	Global dimming is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the Earth's surface that was observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it has been estimated to be of the order of a 4% reduction over the three decades from 1960â€“1990. However, after discounting an anomaly caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, a very slight reversal in the overall trend has been observed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Pollution_over_east_China.jpg/220px-Pollution_over_east_China.jpg
