1.00	Quest_(ship)	Quest (ship)	The Quest, a low-powered, schooner-rigged steamship that sailed from 1917 until sinking in 1962, is best known as the polar exploration vessel of the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition of 1921-1922. It was aboard this vessel that Sir Ernest Shackleton died on 5 January 1922 while the vessel was in harbour in South Georgia. Prior to and after the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition, the Quest operated in commercial service as a seal-hunting vessel or sealer. The Quest was also the primary expedition vessel of the British Arctic Air Route Expedition to the east coast of the island of Greenland in 1930-1931.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cb/Quest1921..jpg/300px-Quest1921..jpg
