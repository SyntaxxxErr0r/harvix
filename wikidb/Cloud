80.8	Cloud	Cloud	In meteorology, a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water and/or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. They are also known as aerosols. Clouds in earth's atmosphere are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology. Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. In general, precipitation will fall to the surface; an exception is virga, which evaporates before reaching the surface.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Cumulus_clouds_panorama.jpg/300px-Cumulus_clouds_panorama.jpg
