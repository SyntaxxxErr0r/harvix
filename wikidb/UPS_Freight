2.10	UPS_Freight	UPS Freight	UPS Freight is the Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) trucking division of UPS. UPS acquired on August 8, 2005 Overnite Transportation (and its subsidiary Motor Cargo) for $1.25 billion. On April 28, 2006 Overnite transportation officially became UPS Ground Freight, Inc. The logos on the doors of the Overnite tractors were covered with signs showing the operator as UPS Freight. UPS freight soon changed the color scheme of the tractors from blue and grey to UPS brown on the bottom, with a gold line near the center of the tractor and gray for the upper color. All new vehicles purchased by UPS freight LTL come painted in these colors as the older Overnite equipment is replaced, while the new tractors for the truckload division (Former Overnite Transportation â€“ Special Services Division) are solid white with the UPS shield on the roof fairing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/UPSIntl4000.jpg/220px-UPSIntl4000.jpg
