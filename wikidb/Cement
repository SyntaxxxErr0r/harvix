73.7	Cement	Cement	In the most general sense of the word, a cement is a binder, a substance that sets and hardens independently, and can bind other materials together. The word "cement" traces to the Romans, who used the term opus caementicium to describe masonry resembling modern concrete that was made from crushed rock with burnt lime as binder. The volcanic ash and pulverized brick additives that were added to the burnt lime to obtain a hydraulic binder were later referred to as cementum, cimentum, c√§ment, and cement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/06_Contes_cimenterie.jpg/220px-06_Contes_cimenterie.jpg
