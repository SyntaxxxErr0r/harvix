6.11	Merijn_Bellekom	HijackThis	HijackThis is an open source enumerating tool for Microsoft Windows originally created by Merijn Bellekom, and later sold to Trend Micro. The program is notable for targeting browser-hijacking methods, rather than relying on a database of known spyware. It scans a user's computer quickly, and displays browser hijacking locations, showing what entries are there. HijackThis is used primarily for diagnosis of browser hijacking, as uninformed use of its removal facilities can cause significant software damage to a computer. HijackThis does not remove or detect spyware; it lists most common locations where browser hijacking activity can occur. Browser hijacking can cause malware to be installed on a computer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/HijackThis.png/250px-HijackThis.png
