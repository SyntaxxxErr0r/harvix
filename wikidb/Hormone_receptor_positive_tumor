2.20	Hormone_receptor_positive_tumor	Hormone receptor positive breast tumor	A hormone-receptor-positive tumor is a tumor which consists of cells that express receptors for certain hormones. The term most commonly refers to estrogen receptor positive tumors (i.e. tumors that contain estrogen receptor positive cells), but can also include progesterone receptor positive tumors. Estrogen-receptor-positive tumors depend on the presence of estrogen for ongoing proliferation.
