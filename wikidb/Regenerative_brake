54.9	Regenerative_brake	Regenerative brake	A regenerative brake is an energy recovery mechanism which slows a vehicle or object down by converting its kinetic energy into another form, which can be either used immediately or stored until needed. This contrasts with conventional braking systems, where the excess kinetic energy is converted to heat by friction in the brake linings and therefore wasted.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Skoda_03_T_roof.jpg/220px-Skoda_03_T_roof.jpg
