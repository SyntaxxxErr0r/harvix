6.00	Biomechanoid	Cyborg	A cyborg, short for "cybernetic organism", is a being with both biological and artificial (e.g. electronic, mechanical or robotic) parts. The term was coined in 1960 when Manfred Clynes and Nathan S. Kline used it in an article about the advantages of self-regulating human-machine systems in outer space. D. S. Halacy's Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' â€“ a bridge...between mind and matter."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/BCI_JensNaumann.png/220px-BCI_JensNaumann.png
