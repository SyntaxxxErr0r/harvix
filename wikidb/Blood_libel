115.1	Blood_libel	Blood libel	Blood libel (also blood accusation) is a false accusation or claim that religious minorities, usually Jews, murder children to use their blood in certain aspects of their religious rituals and holidays. Historically, these claims—alongside those of well poisoning and host desecration—have been a major theme in European persecution of Jews.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Judenstern_JMW.jpg/100px-Judenstern_JMW.jpg
