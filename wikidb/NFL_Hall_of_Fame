The hall opened in Canton, Ohio, on September 7, 1963, with 17 charter enshrinees. Including the most recent six honorees announced in February 2012, there are a total 267 members of the Hall of Fame. The Pro Football Hall of Fame is unique among North American major league sports halls of fame in that officials are not inducted.
