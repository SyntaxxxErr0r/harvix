119.1	Whole_Earth_Catalog	Whole Earth Catalog	The title Whole Earth Catalog came from a previous project of Stewart Brand. In 1966, he initiated a public campaign to have NASA release the then-rumored satellite photo of the sphere of Earth as seen from space, the first image of the "Whole Earth." He thought the image might be a powerful symbol, evoking a sense of shared destiny and adaptive strategies from people. The Stanford-educated Brand, a biologist with strong artistic and social interests, believed that there was a groundswell of commitment to thoroughly renovating American industrial society along ecologically and socially just lines, whatever they might prove to be.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6f/Wh-earth-69-cover.jpg/250px-Wh-earth-69-cover.jpg
