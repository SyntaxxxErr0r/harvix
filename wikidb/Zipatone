1.00	Zipatone	Screentone	Screentone is a technique for applying textures and shades to drawings, used as an alternative to hatching. In the conventional process, patterns are transferred to paper from preprinted sheets, but the technique is also simulated in computer graphics. It is also known by the common brand names Zip-A-Tone (1937, now defunct), Chart-Pak (1949), and Letratone (1966, from Letraset).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Screen_tone_example.svg/220px-Screen_tone_example.svg.png
