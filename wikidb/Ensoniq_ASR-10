7.40	Ensoniq_ASR-10	Ensoniq ASR-10	The Ensoniq ASR-10 was a sampling keyboard produced by Ensoniq between 1992 and 1994. It is the keyboard model of the ASR-10R rackmount module. It was a follow up product to the very popular Ensoniq EPS and Ensoniq EPS-16+ performance samplers, and was also available with a piano style weighted keyboard (ASR-88) and a rackmount version. At the time, the machine was one of the most powerful samplers available.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Ensoniq_ASR-10_rear.jpg/300px-Ensoniq_ASR-10_rear.jpg
