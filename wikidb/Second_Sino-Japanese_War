85.6	Second_Sino-Japanese_War	Second Sino-Japanese War	The Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 – September 2, 1945) was a military conflict fought primarily between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. From 1937 to 1941, China fought Japan with some economic help from Germany (see Sino-German cooperation), the Soviet Union (1937–1940) and the United States (see American Volunteer Group). After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (1941), the war merged into the greater conflict of World War II as a major front of what is broadly known as the Pacific War. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century. It also made up more than 50% of the casualties in the Pacific War if the 1937–1941 period is taken into account.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Japanese_Occupation_-_Map.jpg/300px-Japanese_Occupation_-_Map.jpg
