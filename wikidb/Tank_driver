1.00	Tank_driver	Tank	A tank is a tracked, armoured fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat which combines operational mobility and tactical offensive and defensive capabilities. Firepower is normally provided by a large-calibre main gun in a rotating turret and secondary machine guns, while heavy armour and all-terrain mobility provide protection for the tank and its crew, allowing it to perform all primary tasks of the armoured troops on the battlefield.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Polish_T-72_TW_6-91.jpg/300px-Polish_T-72_TW_6-91.jpg
