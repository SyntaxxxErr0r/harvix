1.00	Jantoven	Warfarin	Warfarin (also known under the brand names Coumadin, Jantoven, Marevan, Lawarin, Waran, and Warfant) is an anticoagulant. While it may be one of many drugs popularly referred to as a "blood thinner" , this is a misnomer, since it does not affect the thickness or viscosity of blood. Instead, it acts on the liver to decrease the quantity of a few key proteins in blood that normally allow blood to clot.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Warfarin.svg/220px-Warfarin.svg.png
