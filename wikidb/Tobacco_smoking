68.6	Tobacco_smoking	Tobacco smoking	Tobacco smoking is the practice where tobacco is burned and the resulting smoke (consisting of particle and gaseous phases) is inhaled. The practice may have begun as early as 5000â€“3000 BC. Tobacco was introduced to Eurasia in the late 16th century where it followed common trade routes. The practice encountered criticism from its first import into the Western world onwards, but embedded itself in certain strata of a number of societies before becoming widespread upon the introduction of automated cigarette-rolling apparatus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Aztec_feast_1.jpg/220px-Aztec_feast_1.jpg
