Yaryan approached Ellington about performing at the new Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. The cathedral was due to open in three to four years and all sorts of cultural events were to occur there in its first year. It was not until two years later that things such as the date and program were finalized.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/A_Concert_of_Sacred_Music.jpg
