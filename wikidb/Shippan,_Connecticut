1.20	Shippan,_Connecticut	Shippan	The Shippan section borders several other neighborhoods: to the south is Shippan Point, to the west is the South End, to the north is Downtown, to the northeast is the East Side, and to the east is The Cove. A few years ago, a few residents of Shippan Point (a section of Shippan) went to the mayor and asked to make Shippan a town itself, separated from Stamford. This idea was rejected by the mayor of Stamford.
