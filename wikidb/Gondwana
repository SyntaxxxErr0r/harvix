61.0	Gondwana	Gondwana	In paleogeography, Gondwana ( ), originally Gondwanaland, was the southernmost of two supercontinents (the other being Laurasia) that later became parts of the Pangaea supercontinent. It existed from approximately 510 to 180 million years ago (Mya). Gondwana is believed to have sutured between ca. 570 and 510 Mya, thus joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. It separated from Laurasia 200-180 Mya (the mid Mesozoic era) during the breakup of Pangaea, drifting further south after the split.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Laurasia-Gondwana.svg/250px-Laurasia-Gondwana.svg.png
