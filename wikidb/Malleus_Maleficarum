51.3	Malleus_Maleficarum	Malleus Maleficarum	The Malleus Maleficarum (Latin for "Hammer of the Witches", or "Der Hexenhammer" in German) is an infamous treatise on witches, written in 1486 by Heinrich Kramer, an Inquisitor of the Catholic Church, and was first published in Germany in 1487. Jacob Sprenger is also often attributed as an author, but some scholars now believe that he became associated with the Malleus Maleficarum largely as a result of Kramer's wish to lend his book as much official authority as possible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Malleus.jpg/270px-Malleus.jpg
