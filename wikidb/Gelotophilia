7.10	Gelotophilia	Gelotophilia	Gelotophilia describes the joy of being laughed at. Gelotophiles are persons that actively seek and establish situations in which others may laugh at them. They gain joy out of these situations. They do not feel embarrassed when sharing embarrassing things that happened to them for making others laugh at them. Gelotophiles speak frankly about misfortunes and mishaps but also about situations in which they acted stupidly or produced something that was involuntarily funny. Typically, they would not mind if they were caught on camera while something funny (yet potentially embarrassing) happened to them and this was sent to a TV program that shows such clips or if it was uploaded to websites such as Youtube or the like.
