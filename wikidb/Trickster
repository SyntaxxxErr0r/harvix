55.0	Trickster	Trickster	In mythology, and in the study of folklore and religion, a trickster is a god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphic animal who plays tricks or otherwise disobeys normal rules and conventional behavior. It is suggested by Hansen (2001) that the term "Trickster" was probably first used in this context by Daniel G. Brinton in 1885.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Reynard-the-fox.jpg/250px-Reynard-the-fox.jpg
