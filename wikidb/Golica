1.10	Golica	Golica	Golica (1836 m) (German: ) is a peak in the Western Karavanke Alps, on the border between Slovenia and Austria, above the Slovene town of Jesenice. It is known mainly for its fields of wild white narcissi, swathes of which cover Golica and surrounding pastures in late April and early May. This marks the beginning of a popular time for mountaineers to visit, extending through the end of summer. The slopes provide great views of the Julian Alps and Austrian Carinthia; the Ljubljana Basin can be seen from the summit on clear days.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Golica_mountain.jpg/280px-Golica_mountain.jpg
