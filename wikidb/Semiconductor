107.6	Semiconductor	Semiconductor	A semiconductor is a material with electrical conductivity intermediate in magnitude between that of a conductor and an insulator. This means a conductivity roughly in the range of 103 to 10âˆ’8 siemens per centimeter. Semiconductor materials are the foundation of modern electronics, including radio, computers, telephones, and many other devices. Such devices include transistors, solar cells, many kinds of diodes including the light-emitting diode (LED), the silicon controlled rectifier, photo-diode, and digital and analog integrated circuits. Semiconductor solar photovoltaic panels directly convert light energy into electricity. In a metallic conductor, current is carried by the flow of electrons. Diagrams of semiconductors may point either towards or against the direction of electrons, this non-uniformity in labling and resulting confusion can partially be blamed on Benjamin Franklin, who defined "positive" and "negative" in electricity before the discovery of the electron.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/HAtomOrbitals.png/120px-HAtomOrbitals.png
