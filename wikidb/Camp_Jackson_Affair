The highly publicized affair polarized the border state of Missouri, leading some citizens to advocate secession and others to support the Union, thus setting the stage for sustained violence between the opposing factions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/St-louis-riot1.jpg/300px-St-louis-riot1.jpg
