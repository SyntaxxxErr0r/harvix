2.10	Coronation_Park,_Delhi	Coronation Park, Delhi	Coronation Park is a park located on Burari road near Nirankari Sarovar in Delhi, India. The park is sometimes referred to as the Coronation Memorial; it was the venue of Delhi Durbar of 1877 when Queen Victoria was proclaimed the Empress of India. Later it was used to celebrate the accession of Edward VII in 1903, and finally, it was here that the Durbar commemorating the coronation of King George V as Emperor of India took place on 12 December 1911, subsequent to his coronation at Westminster Abbey in June 1911. This last celebration had all the princely states in attendance. The decision to hold the Coronation Durbars in Delhi at the vast open ground at Coronation Park was a move to emphasize Delhi's past history.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/The_Obelsik_marking_the_Durbar_of_King_George_V_at_Coronation_Park%2C_Delhi.2JPG.jpg/250px-The_Obelsik_marking_the_Durbar_of_King_George_V_at_Coronation_Park%2C_Delhi.2JPG.jpg
