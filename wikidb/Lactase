59.6	Lactase	Lactase	Lactase (also known as lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, or LPH), a part of the Î²-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a glycoside hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers. Lactase is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. In humans, lactase is encoded by the LCT gene.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Lactase_mechanism.png/500px-Lactase_mechanism.png
