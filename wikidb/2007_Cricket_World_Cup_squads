2.00	2007_Cricket_World_Cup_squads	2007 Cricket World Cup squads	This is a list of the squads picked for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. This was the eighth Cricket World Cup tournament and was held between 14 March and 28 April 2007. The sixteen teams were asked to announce their final squads by 13 February 2007. Changes were allowed after this deadline at the discretion of the ICCs Technical Committee in necessary cases, such as due to player injury. In order to aid the teams to select the final fifteen, teams were given the option to announce a thirty man squad by mid-January, with the understanding that the final squad would be picked from within these thirty players. However this was not strictly adhered toâ€”several of England's final fifteen came from outside the initial thirty, for example.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/ICC_CWC_2007_team_captains.jpg/250px-ICC_CWC_2007_team_captains.jpg
