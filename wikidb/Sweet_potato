72.5	Sweet_potato	Sweet potato	The sweet potato is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the family Convolvulaceae. Its large, starchy, sweet-tasting, tuberous roots are an important root vegetable. The young leaves and shoots are sometimes eaten as greens. Of the approximately 50 genera and more than 1,000 species of Convolvulaceae, I. batatas is the only crop plant of major importanceâ€”some others are used locally, but many are actually poisonous. The sweet potato is only distantly related to the potato (Solanum tuberosum).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ipomoea_batatas.jpg/240px-Ipomoea_batatas.jpg
