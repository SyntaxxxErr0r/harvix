2.00	Recycling_in_Ireland	Recycling in Ireland	Rates of household recycling in Ireland have increased dramatically since the late 1990s, but are still lagging behind the averages of other European countries. The Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the agency with overall responsibility for recycling, and acts as the watchdog for the waste management industry in Ireland. Each local authority in Ireland has considerable control over recycling, so recycling practices vary considerably across the country. Ireland does not currently have any incineration facilities (though some are planned), so any waste that is not recycled is disposed of in landfill sites. The Central Statistics Office reported in 2007 that almost 90% of Irish households recycled some of their household waste, compared to just 48% in 1999. The figure was highest for residents in Dublin (94%).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Green_bin_collection_in_Dublin.jpg/300px-Green_bin_collection_in_Dublin.jpg
