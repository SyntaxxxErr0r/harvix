1.00	Gungsangnorbu	Gungsangnorbu	Gungsangnorbu (1871â€“1930) was an Inner Mongolian prince and politician of the Republic of China. Some scholars describe him as a moderate, progressive moderniser caught between the influence of conservative older leaders and young radicals. Others describe him less favourably as a conservative who, despite his early activities for promoting education, would go on to become protective of his own rights and interest as a member of the nobility, and suspicious of young Mongols who had received a modern education as potential challengers to those interests.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Gongsangnuoerbu.jpg/220px-Gongsangnuoerbu.jpg
