62.4	Binary_space_partitioning	Binary space partitioning	In computer science, binary space partitioning is a method for recursively subdividing a space into convex sets by hyperplanes. This subdivision gives rise to a representation of the scene by means of a tree data structure known as a BSP tree.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Binary_space_partition.svg/460px-Binary_space_partition.svg.png
