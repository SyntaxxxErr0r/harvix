23.62	Greengage	Greengage	The greengages, also known as the Reine Claudes, are the edible drupaceous fruits of a cultivar group of the common European plum. The first true greengage was bred in Moissac, France, from a green-fruited wild plum originally found in Asia Minor; the original greengage cultivar nowadays survives in an almost unchanged form as 'Reine Claude Verte'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Owoce_Renkloda.jpg/260px-Owoce_Renkloda.jpg
