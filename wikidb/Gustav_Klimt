153.3	Gustav_Klimt	Gustav Klimt	Gustav Klimt (July 14, 1862– February 6, 1918) was an Austrian Symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. His major works include paintings, murals, sketches, and other art objects. Klimt's primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism—nowhere is this more apparent than in his numerous drawings in pencil (see Mulher sentada, below).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Klimt.jpg/220px-Klimt.jpg
