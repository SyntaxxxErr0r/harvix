Since sometimes great amounts of time are contributed by drummers practicing on drum pads via their allowance for a much subtler volume level and general ease of application, several variances have been created to equip in this area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Practicepad.jpg/200px-Practicepad.jpg
