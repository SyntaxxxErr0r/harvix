72.2	Carter_Family	Carter Family	The Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on bluegrass, country, Southern Gospel, pop and rock musicians as well as on the U.S. folk revival of the 1960s. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars. Their recordings of such songs as "Wabash Cannonball", "Can the Circle Be Unbroken", "Wildwood Flower" and "Keep On the Sunny Side" made them country standards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/The_Carter_Family.jpg
