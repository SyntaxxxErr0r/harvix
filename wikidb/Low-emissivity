29.44	Low-emissivity	Low emissivity	Low emissivity (low e) - actually low thermal emissivity - is a quality of a surface that radiates, or emits, low levels of radiant thermal (heat) energy. All materials absorb, reflect and emit radiant energy. This article is primarily about material properties within a special wavelength interval of radiant energy - namely thermal radiation of materials with temperatures approximately in the interval -40..60Â°C.
