2.00	Hammersmith_tube_station_(Hammersmith_%26_City_Line)	Hammersmith tube station (Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines)	Hammersmith is a London Underground station in Hammersmith. It is the western terminus of the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2 and is a short walk from the station of the same name on the Piccadilly and District lines. The two stations are separated by Hammersmith Broadway. As the crow flies, they are about 60 m (200 ft) apart door to door, although the positions of the pedestrian crossings on the Broadway makes it more like 135 m (450 ft) on foot. See here for a close-up map. The north of the two roundels is the Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines station, the south one is the Piccadilly and District lines station. The Circle line has served Hammersmith since 13 December 2009. By June 2011 all of the platforms had been lengthened to accommodate the new and longer trains of the S Stock that will enter service in late 2011 / early 2012. These new trains will be seven cars in length instead of the six cars of C Stock that currently operate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Hammersmith_%28H_%26_C_line%29_station_building.JPG/240px-Hammersmith_%28H_%26_C_line%29_station_building.JPG
