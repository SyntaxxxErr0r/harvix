The central mountain is named after Anise, Pimpinella anisum, which is found here. The reserve was established in 1988 to conserve Succulent and Fynbos flora in the Cape Fold Belt, and to reintroduce game which formerly occurred here.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Blank_map_of_the_Western_Cape_%282011%29.svg/284px-Blank_map_of_the_Western_Cape_%282011%29.svg.png
