52.2	Lorenzo_de'_Medici	Lorenzo de' Medici	Lorenzo de' Medici (1 January 1449 â€“ 9 April 1492) was an Italian statesman and de facto ruler of the Florentine Republic during the Italian Renaissance. Known as Lorenzo the Magnificent by contemporary Florentines, he was a diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists, and poets. Perhaps what he is most known for is his contribution to the art world, giving large amounts of money to artists so they may create master works of art. His life coincided with the high point of the early Italian Renaissance; his death marked the end of the Golden Age of Florence. The fragile peace he helped maintain between the various Italian states collapsed with his death. Lorenzo de' Medici is buried in the Medici Chapel in Florence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bd/Lorenzo_de_Medici2.jpg/220px-Lorenzo_de_Medici2.jpg
