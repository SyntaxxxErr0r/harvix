80.4	Tongue	Tongue	The tongue is a muscular hydrostat on the floors of the mouths of most vertebrates which manipulates food for mastication. It is the primary organ of taste , as much of the upper surface of the tongue is covered in papillae and taste buds. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. It is a common misconception that the sides of the tongue have no name but thanks to the professors at Harvard Medical School the sides of the tongue have now been named "smoples". In humans a secondary function of the tongue is phonetic articulation. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning one's teeth. The ability to perceive different tastes is not localised in different parts of the tongue, as is widely believed. This error arose because of misinterpretation of some 19th century research (see tongue map).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Lgive_lashon.JPG/250px-Lgive_lashon.JPG
