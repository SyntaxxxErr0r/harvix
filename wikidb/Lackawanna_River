7.01	Lackawanna_River	Lackawanna River	The Lackawanna River is a 40.8-mile-long (65.7 km) tributary of the Susquehanna River in northeastern Pennsylvania in the United States. It flows through a region of the northern Pocono Mountains that was once a center of anthracite coal mining in the United States. The lower reaches of the river flow through the urbanized areas of Scranton, which grew around its banks in the 19th century as an industrial center. Its name comes from a Lenni Lenape word meaning "stream that forks".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Lackariversmap.png/350px-Lackariversmap.png
