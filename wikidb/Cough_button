1.00	Cough_button	Broadcast delay	In radio and television, broadcast delay refers to the practice of intentionally delaying broadcast of live material. A short delay is often used to prevent profanity, bloopers, violence, or other undesirable material from making it to air, including more mundane problems such as technical malfunctions or coughing. In this instance, it is often referred to as a seven-second delay or profanity delay.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Redacted777.jpg/100px-Redacted777.jpg
