57.0	Pigment	Pigment	A pigment is a material that changes the color of reflected or transmitted light as the result of wavelength-selective absorption. This physical process differs from fluorescence, phosphorescence, and other forms of luminescence, in which a material emits light.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Natural_ultramarine_pigment.jpg/220px-Natural_ultramarine_pigment.jpg
