3.20	Lords_Of_Acid	Lords of Acid	Lords of Acid is a Belgian-American post-industrial/techno band, led by musician Praga Khan. They debuted with the controversial new beat single "I Sit on Acid" in 1988. Created by Jade 4U, Praga Khan, and Olivier Adams; their debut album, 1991's Lust (along with additional singles "Rough Sex" and "I Must Increase My Bust"), were critically acclaimed within the electronic music and dance music communities for their outrageously sexual lyrics and sound samples. Their second album was Voodoo-U, which featured a more industrial sound. This was followed by Our Little Secret (1997), Heaven Is an Orgasm (1998) and Expand Your Head (1999). In 2000 they released a more rock-influenced album entitled Farstucker and in 2003, after being in the business for fifteen years, released a greatest hits album called Greatest T*ts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bc/Lords_of_Acid.jpg/220px-Lords_of_Acid.jpg
