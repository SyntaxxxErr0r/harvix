59.2	Taxicab	Taxicab	A taxicab, also taxi or cab, is a type of vehicle for hire with a driver, used by a single passenger or small group of passengers, often for a non-shared ride. A taxicab conveys passengers between locations of their choice. In modes of public transport, the pick-up and drop-off locations are determined by the service provider, not by the passenger, although demand responsive transport and share taxis provide a hybrid bus/taxi mode.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Jazzexpress_taxi_Vilnius.jpg/220px-Jazzexpress_taxi_Vilnius.jpg
