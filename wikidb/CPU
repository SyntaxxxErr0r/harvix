84.0	CPU	Central processing unit	The central processing unit is the portion of a computer system that carries out the instructions of a computer program, to perform the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system. The CPU plays a role somewhat analogous to the brain in the computer. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed dramatically since the earliest examples, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Intel_80486DX2_top.jpg/220px-Intel_80486DX2_top.jpg
