54.1	Typographic_ligature	Typographic ligature	In writing and typography, a ligature occurs where two or more graphemes are joined as a single glyph. Ligatures usually replace consecutive characters sharing common components and are part of a more general class of glyphs called "contextual forms", where the specific shape of a letter depends on context such as surrounding letters or proximity to the end of a line.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Fi_garamond_sort_001.png/200px-Fi_garamond_sort_001.png
