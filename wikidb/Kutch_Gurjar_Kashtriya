They are a group of various Kshatriya or Rajput clans who were bound together by their artistic and master craftsman skills in constructing forts, temples, palaces, ornate decorations, idols and other buildings and statues that led to them being referred to as Mistri by the Portuguese. This term was later used to refer to them as a separate caste known as the Mistri (Gujarati: ) a.k.a.
