60.4	Lenticular_cloud	Lenticular cloud	Lenticular clouds are stationary lens-shaped clouds that form at high altitudes, normally aligned perpendicular to the wind direction. Lenticular clouds can be separated into altocumulus standing lenticularis (ACSL), stratocumulus standing lenticular (SCSL), and cirrocumulus standing lenticular (CCSL). Due to their shape, they have been offered as an explanation for some Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) sightings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Saucer_cloud_over_Campbell_Mesa%2C_AZ.jpg/300px-Saucer_cloud_over_Campbell_Mesa%2C_AZ.jpg
