63.1	Methuselah	Methuselah	Methuselah is the oldest person whose age is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. Extra-biblical tradition maintains that he died on the 11th of Cheshvan of the year 1656 (Anno Mundi, after Creation), at the age of 969, seven days before the beginning of the Great Flood. According to Rashi on Genesis 7:4, God delayed the Flood specifically because of the seven days of mourning in honor of the righteous Methuselah. Methuselah was the son of Enoch and the grandfather of Noah.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/HarrowingBermejo.jpg/270px-HarrowingBermejo.jpg
