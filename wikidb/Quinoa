228.3	Quinoa	Quinoa	Quinoa ( or , Spanish: , from Quechua: ), a species of goosefoot , is a grain-like crop grown primarily for its edible seeds. It is a pseudocereal rather than a true cereal, or grain, as it is not a member of the grass family. As a chenopod, quinoa is closely related to species such as beets, spinach, and tumbleweeds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Quinua.JPG/220px-Quinua.JPG
