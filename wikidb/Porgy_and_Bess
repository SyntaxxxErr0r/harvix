70.4	Porgy_and_Bess	Porgy and Bess	Porgy and Bess is an opera, first performed in 1935, with music by George Gershwin, libretto by DuBose Heyward, and lyrics by Ira Gershwin and DuBose Heyward. It was based on DuBose Heyward's novel Porgy and subsequent play of the same title, which he co-wrote with his wife Dorothy Heyward. All three works deal with African-American life in the fictitious Catfish Row (based on the area of Cabbage Row) in Charleston, South Carolina, in the early 1920s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/Porgyandbess.gif/310px-Porgyandbess.gif
