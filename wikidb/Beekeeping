84.5	Beekeeping	Beekeeping	Beekeeping (or apiculture, from Latin apis, bee) is the maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, by humans. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect honey and other products of the hive (including beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or "bee yard".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/27-alimenti%2C_miele%2C_Taccuino_Sanitatis%2C_Casanatense_4182..jpg/250px-27-alimenti%2C_miele%2C_Taccuino_Sanitatis%2C_Casanatense_4182..jpg
