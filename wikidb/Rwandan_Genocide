238.7	Rwandan_Genocide	Rwandan Genocide	The Rwandan Genocide was the 1994 mass murder of an estimated 800,000 people in the small East African nation of Rwanda. Over the course of approximately 100 days (from the assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6) through mid-July, over 500,000 people were killed, according to a Human Rights Watch estimate. Estimates of the death toll have ranged between 500,000 and 1,000,000, or as much as 20% of the country's total population. It was the culmination of longstanding ethnic competition and tensions between the minority Tutsi, who had controlled power for centuries, and the majority Hutu peoples, who had come to power in the rebellion of 1959–62 and overthrown the Tutsi monarchy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/UNAMIR_Blue_Barrets_memorial_Kigali_%283%29.jpg/220px-UNAMIR_Blue_Barrets_memorial_Kigali_%283%29.jpg
