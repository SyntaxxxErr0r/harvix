3.10	Nature_of_America	Nature of America	Nature of America is a series of self adhesive stamp sheets that the United States Postal Service has been releasing annually since 1999 till 2010 starting with the Sonoran Desert sheet and ending with the Hawaiin Rain Forest Sheet. Like the Celebrate the Century stamp series, these too were printed on large sheets 9"x8Â¾" (233mm x 171mm), but differed in that they were self adhesive and not gummed like the former.
