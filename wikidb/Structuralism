75.0	Structuralism	Structuralism	Structuralism is a theoretical paradigm that emphasizes that elements of culture must be understood in terms of their relationship to a larger, overarching system or "structure." Alternately, as summarized by philosopher Simon Blackburn, Structuralism is "the belief that phenomena of human life are not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Pepsi_in_India.jpg/110px-Pepsi_in_India.jpg
