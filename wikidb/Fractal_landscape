19.33	Fractal_landscape	Fractal landscape	A fractal landscape is a surface generated using a stochastic algorithm designed to produce fractal behaviour that mimics the appearance of natural terrain. In other words, the result of the procedure is not a deterministic fractal surface, but rather a random surface that exhibits fractal behaviour.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Animated_fractal_mountain.gif/300px-Animated_fractal_mountain.gif
