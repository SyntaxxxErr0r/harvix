80.5	Electrical_generator	Electric generator	In electricity generation, an electric generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. A generator forces electric charge (usually carried by electrons) to flow through an external electrical circuit. It is analogous to a water pump, which causes water to flow (but does not create water). The source of mechanical energy may be a reciprocating or turbine steam engine, water falling through a turbine or waterwheel, an internal combustion engine, a wind turbine, a hand crank, compressed air or any other source of mechanical energy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Modern_Steam_Turbine_Generator.jpg/400px-Modern_Steam_Turbine_Generator.jpg
