73.5	Turbo_Pascal	Turbo Pascal	Turbo Pascal is a software development system that includes a compiler and an integrated development environment (IDE) for the Pascal programming language running on CP/M, CP/M-86, and DOS, developed by Borland under Philippe Kahn's leadership. From version 6 both a lower-priced Turbo Pascal and more expensive Borland Pascal were produced; Borland Pascal had more libraries and standard library source code. The name Borland Pascal is also used more generically for Borland's dialect of Pascal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Tp40_1987_01.jpg/250px-Tp40_1987_01.jpg
