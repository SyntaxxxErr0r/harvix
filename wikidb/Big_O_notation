171.2	Big_O_notation	Big O notation	In mathematics, big O notation is used to describe the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, usually in terms of simpler functions. It is a member of a larger family of notations that is called Landau notation, Bachmann-Landau notation, or asymptotic notation. In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms by how they respond (i.e., in their processing time or working space requirements) to changes in input size.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Big-O-notation.png/400px-Big-O-notation.png
