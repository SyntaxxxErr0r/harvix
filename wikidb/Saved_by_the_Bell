67.0	Saved_by_the_Bell	Saved by the Bell	Saved by the Bell is an American television sitcom that aired between 1989 and 1993. The series is a retooled version of the 1988 series Good Morning, Miss Bliss, which was itself later folded into the backstory of Saved by the Bell. The TV series followed the exploits of several students along with their principal at fictional Bayside High School. Each season of the series basically represented a year of high school for the students, plus summer vacations, ending with their graduation. The sitcom name is an idiom for being saved, by a school bell ringing, when a student is unprepared to answer a question asked near the end of a classroom period.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Saved_By_the_Bell_Title_Card.jpg/220px-Saved_By_the_Bell_Title_Card.jpg
