6.30	Spencer_carbine	Spencer repeating rifle	The Spencer repeating rifle was a manually operated lever-action, repeating rifle fed from a tube magazine with cartridges. It was adopted by the Union Army, especially by the cavalry, during the American Civil War, but did not replace the standard issue muzzle-loading rifled muskets in use at the time. The Spencer carbine was a shorter and lighter version.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Spencer-rifle.JPG/300px-Spencer-rifle.JPG
