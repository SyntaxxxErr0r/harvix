125.6	Direct_current	Direct current	Direct current is the unidirectional flow of electric charge. Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, thermocouples, solar cells, and commutator-type electric machines of the dynamo type. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric charge flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for direct current was galvanic current.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Types_of_current.svg/250px-Types_of_current.svg.png
