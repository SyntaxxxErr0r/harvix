63.3	The_Joshua_Tree	The Joshua Tree	The Joshua Tree is the fifth studio album by rock band U2. It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 9 March 1987 on Island Records. In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 release The Unforgettable Fire, U2 aimed for a harder-hitting sound on The Joshua Tree within the limitation of strict song structures. The album is influenced by American and Irish roots music and depicts the band's love-hate relationship with the United States, with socially and politically conscious lyrics embellished with spiritual imagery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/The_Joshua_Tree.png/220px-The_Joshua_Tree.png
