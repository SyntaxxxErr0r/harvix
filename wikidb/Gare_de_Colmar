1.10	Gare_de_Colmar	Gare de Colmar	The gare de Colmar is a rail station located in Colmar, in the Haut-Rhin d√©partement of Alsace, France. The same design was used in the construction of Gdansk's principal train station in Poland. Thus the buildings are twins of one another.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Gare_colmar.jpg/300px-Gare_colmar.jpg
