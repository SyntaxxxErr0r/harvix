Umeboshi are a popular kind of tsukemono (pickles) and are extremely sour and salty. They are usually served as side dishes for rice or eaten on rice balls (often without removing the pit) for breakfast and lunch. They are occasionally served boiled or seasoned for dinner.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Umeboshi2.JPG/220px-Umeboshi2.JPG
