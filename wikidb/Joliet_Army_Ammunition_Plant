6.31	Joliet_Army_Ammunition_Plant	Joliet Army Ammunition Plant	Joliet Army Ammunition Plant formerly known as the Joliet Arsenal was a United States Army arsenal located in Will County, Illinois, near Elwood, Illinois, south of Joliet, Illinois. Opened in 1940 during World War II, the facility consisted of the Elwood Ordnance Plant and the Kankakee Ordnance Works. In 1945, the two were deactivated and combined forming the Joliet Arsenal. The plant was reactivated for the Korean War and renamed Joliet Army Ammunition Plant during the Vietnam War. Production of TNT ended in 1976, and the major plant operations closed shortly after in the late 1970s. The facility briefly revived an automated load-assemble-pack (LAP) artillery shell operation that was managed by the Honeywell Corporation during the Reagan administration in the 1980s before it was finally closed. Portions of the site have been redeveloped forming an Intermodal freight transport hub, Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery and Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Joliet_Arsenal_proposed_redevelopment_map.png/350px-Joliet_Arsenal_proposed_redevelopment_map.png
