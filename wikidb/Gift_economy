110.7	Gift_economy	Gift economy	In the social sciences, a gift economy (or gift culture) is a society where valuable goods and services are regularly given without any explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards (i.e. no formal quid pro quo exists). Ideally, simultaneous or recurring giving serves to circulate and redistribute valuables within the community. The organization of a gift economy stands in contrast to a barter economy or a market economy. Informal custom governs exchanges, rather than an explicit exchange of goods or services for money or some other commodity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Klallam_people_at_Port_Townsend.jpg/220px-Klallam_people_at_Port_Townsend.jpg
