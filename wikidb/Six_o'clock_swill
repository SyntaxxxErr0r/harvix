10.73	Six_o'clock_swill	Six o'clock swill	The six o'clock swill was an Australian and New Zealand slang term for the last-minute rush to buy drinks at a hotel bar before it closed. During a significant part of the 20th century, most Australian and New Zealand hotels shut their public bars at 6 p.m. A culture developed of heavy drinking during the hour between finishing work at 5 p.m. and the bars closing at this early hour.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/1938OppositionToChangesTo6o%27clockClosing.jpg/220px-1938OppositionToChangesTo6o%27clockClosing.jpg
