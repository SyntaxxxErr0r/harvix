63.5	Rapeseed	Brassica napus	Brassica napus, also known as rapeseed, rape, oilseed rape, rapa, rappi, rapaseed (and in the case of one particular group of cultivars, canola), is a bright yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family). The name derives from the Latin for turnip, rāpa or rāpum, and is first recorded in English at the end of the 14th century. Older writers usually distinguished the turnip and rape by the adjectives round and long(-rooted) respectively. See also Brassica napobrassica, which may be considered a variety of Brassica napus. Some botanists include the closely related Brassica campestris within B. napus. (See Triangle of U). Rapeseed is the third largest source of vegetable oil in the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Brassica_napus_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-169.jpg/220px-Brassica_napus_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-169.jpg
