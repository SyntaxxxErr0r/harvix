81.5	Book_burning	Book burning	Book burning (also biblioclasm or libricide) is the practice of destroying, often ceremoniously, books or other written material. In modern times, other forms of media, such as phonograph records, video tapes, and CDs have also been ceremoniously burned or shredded. Book burning is usually carried out in public, and is generally motivated by moral, religious, or political objections to the material.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Redacted777.jpg/100px-Redacted777.jpg
