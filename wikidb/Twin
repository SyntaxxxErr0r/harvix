84.4	Twin	Twin	A twin is one of two offspring produced in the same pregnancy. Twins can either be monozygotic ("identical"), meaning that they develop from one zygote that splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic ("fraternal") because they develop from two separate eggs that are fertilized by two separate sperm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/TwinGirls.jpg/220px-TwinGirls.jpg
