1.00	Phylactolaemata	Phylactolaemata	Phylactolaemata is a class of the phylum Bryozoa whose members live only in freshwater environments. Like all bryozoans, they filter feed by means of an extensible "crown" of ciliated tentacles called a lophophore. They live in colonies, each of which consists of clones of the founding member. Unlike those of some marine bryozoans, phylactolaemate colonies consist of only one type of zooid, the feeding forms known as autozooids. These are supported by an unmineralized "exoskeleton" made of gelatinous material or protein, secreted by the zooids.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Bryozoa.jpg/220px-Bryozoa.jpg
