64.1	Male	Male	Male (â™‚) refers to the biological sex of an organism, or part of an organism, which produces small mobile gametes, called spermatozoa. Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete or ovum, in the process of fertilization. A male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Male.svg/220px-Male.svg.png
