53.9	Tropicalismo	Tropicália	Tropicália, also known as Tropicalism, is a Brazilian music movement that arose in the late 1960s and encompassed theatre, poetry, and music, among other forms. Came under the influence of avant-garde artistic trends and pop culture and foreign (such as pop-rock and concreteness); mixed traditional manifestations of Brazilian culture to radical aesthetic innovations. Tropicália was influenced by poesia concreta (concrete poetry), a genre of Brazilian avant-garde poetry embodied in the works of Augusto de Campos, Haroldo de Campos, and Décio Pignatari, among a few others. However, Tropicália is associated almost exclusively with the musical expression movement, both in Brazil and internationally, which arose from the fusion of several musical genres, like Brazilian and African rhythms and rock and roll. The movement is mainly expressed in music (whose greatest representatives were Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Torquato Neto, Os Mutantes and Tom Zé); artistic events as diverse as the arts (emphasis on the figure of Hélio Oiticica), film (the movement has been influenced and influenced the new film by Glauber Rocha) and the Brazilian theater (especially in lawless parts of José Celso Martinez Corrêa). One of the greatest examples of the Tropicalia movement was one of the songs by Caetano Veloso, called exactly "Tropicalia."
