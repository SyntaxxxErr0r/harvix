60.8	Neopaganism	Paganism (contemporary)	Contemporary Paganism, or Neopaganism, is an umbrella term used to identify a wide variety of modern religious movements, particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various pagan beliefs of pre-modern Europe. Although they do share commonalities, contemporary pagan religious movements are extremely diverse, and there is no set of beliefs, practices or religious texts shared by all of them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Slavic_neopaganism.jpg/250px-Slavic_neopaganism.jpg
