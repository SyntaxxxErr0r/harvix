2.20	List_of_spacewalks_since_2000	List of spacewalks since 2000	This list contains all spacewalks performed since the beginning of 2000 where an astronaut has fully, or partially left the spacecraft. As of July 12, 2011, 197 astronauts have made spacewalks (out of 520 people who have gone into Earth orbit). Only 11 women have been on spacewalks, in part because the EVA suits are too large for some women.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/STS-130_EVA1_Robert_Behnken_and_Nicholas_Patrick_1.jpg/325px-STS-130_EVA1_Robert_Behnken_and_Nicholas_Patrick_1.jpg
