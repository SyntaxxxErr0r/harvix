1.00	Point_(landform)	Peninsula	A peninsula is a piece of land that is bordered by water on three sides but connected to mainland. In many Germanic and Celtic languages and also in Baltic, Slavic, Hungarian and Chinese, peninsulas are called "half-islands". A peninsula can also be a headland (head), cape, island promontory, bill, point, or spit. Note that a point is generally considered a tapering piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape. In English, the plural of peninsula is peninsulas or, less commonly, peninsulae.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Peninsula_croatia.jpg/300px-Peninsula_croatia.jpg
