34.86	Bacillus_Calmette-Gu%C3%A9rin	Bacillus Calmette-Guérin	Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (or Bacille Calmette-Guérin, BCG) is a vaccine against tuberculosis that is prepared from a strain of the attenuated (weakened) live bovine tuberculosis bacillus, Mycobacterium bovis, that has lost its virulence in humans by being specially subcultured (230 passages) in an artificial medium for 13 years, and also prepared from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacilli have retained enough strong antigenicity to become a somewhat effective vaccine for the prevention of human tuberculosis. At best, the BCG vaccine is 80% effective in preventing tuberculosis for a duration of 15 years; however, its protective effect appears to vary according to geography.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Mycobacterium_bovis_BCG_ZN.jpg/250px-Mycobacterium_bovis_BCG_ZN.jpg
