65.4	Region	Region	Global regions are those areas of the planet that are easily distinguishable from space, and are therefore clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land and water. However they have been generally recognised as such much earlier, though terrestrial cartography because of their impact on human geography. They are divided into largest of land regions, known as continents, and the largest of water regions known as oceans. There are also significant regions that do not belong to either of these classifications, such as archipelago regions that are littoral regions, or earthquake regions that are defined in geology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/World-map-2004-cia-factbook-large-1.7m-whitespace-removed.jpg/390px-World-map-2004-cia-factbook-large-1.7m-whitespace-removed.jpg
