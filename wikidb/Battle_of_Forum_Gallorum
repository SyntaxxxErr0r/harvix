4.30	Battle_of_Forum_Gallorum	Battle of Forum Gallorum	The Battle of Forum Gallorum was fought near a village in northern Italy (perhaps near modern day Castelfranco Emilia), on April 14, 43 BC, between the forces of Mark Antony and the legions of the Roman Republic under the overall command of consul Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus, aided by Aulus Hirtius and the untested Octavian (the future Caesar Augustus). After months of negotiations between the Senate and Antony did little to settle the questions of power and government after Caesar's assassination, this conflict became unavoidable.
