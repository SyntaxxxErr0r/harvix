73.7	Maypole	Maypole	A maypole is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, particularly on May Day, or Pentecost although in some countries it is instead erected at Midsummer. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Maypole_Sweden.jpg/300px-Maypole_Sweden.jpg
