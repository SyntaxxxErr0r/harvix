3.01	Swinging_Friar	List of Major League Baseball mascots	Ace is the official mascot of the Toronto Blue Jays. He, along with his female counterpart, "Diamond" replaced former mascot BJ Birdie before the 2002 season as a mascot duo. Like his predecessor, Ace resembles a large Blue Jay. The mascot's name is baseball slang for a team's top starting pitcher (the "ace" of the staff, such as former Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Blue_Jays_Mascot.jpg/220px-Blue_Jays_Mascot.jpg
