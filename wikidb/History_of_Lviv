3.20	History_of_Lviv	History of Lviv	As a part of Poland (and later Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) the city was known as Lwów and became the capital of the Ruthenian Voivodeship, which included five regions: Lwów, Chełm (Ukrainian: ), Sanok, Halicz (Ukrainian: ) and Przemyśl (Ukrainian: ). The city was granted the right of transit and started to gain significant profit from the goods transported between the Black Sea and the Baltic. In the following centuries, the city's population grew rapidly and soon Lwów became a multi-ethnic and multi-religious city as well as an important centre of culture, science and trade.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Lw%C3%B3w_-_Widok_z_wie%C5%BCy_ratuszowej_01.jpg/300px-Lw%C3%B3w_-_Widok_z_wie%C5%BCy_ratuszowej_01.jpg
