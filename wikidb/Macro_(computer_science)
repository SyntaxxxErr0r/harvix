62.1	Macro_(computer_science)	Macro (computer science)	A macro (from the Greek μακρό for "big" or "far") in computer science is a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to an output sequence (also often a sequence of characters) according to a defined procedure. The mapping process that instantiates (transforms) a macro into a specific output sequence is known as macro expansion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Jedit_macro_recorder.png/220px-Jedit_macro_recorder.png
