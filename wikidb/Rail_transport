77.5	Rail_transport	Rail transport	Rail transport is a means of conveyance of passengers and goods by way of wheeled vehicles running on rail tracks. In contrast to road transport, where vehicles merely run on a prepared surface, rail vehicles are also directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Track usually consists of steel rails installed on sleepers/ties and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. However, other variations are also possible, such as slab track where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/BNSF_GE_Dash-9_C44-9W_Kennewick_-_Wishram_WA.jpg/300px-BNSF_GE_Dash-9_C44-9W_Kennewick_-_Wishram_WA.jpg
