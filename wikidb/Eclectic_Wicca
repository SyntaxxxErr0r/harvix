Developed in England in the first half of the 20th century, Wicca was popularised in the 1950s and early 1960s by a retired British civil servant named Gerald Gardner, who at the time called it the "witch cult" and "witchcraft", and its adherents "the Wica". From the 1960s onward, the name of the religion was normalised to "Wicca".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/The_Spiral_Pentacle_by_SingingGandalf.jpg/220px-The_Spiral_Pentacle_by_SingingGandalf.jpg
