During this time, Indian, Asyriac, Iranian and especially Greek knowledge was translated into Arabic. These translations became a wellspring for scientific advances, by scientists from the Islamic civilization, during the Middle Ages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Libr0310.jpg/220px-Libr0310.jpg
