51.6	Natural_number	Natural number	In mathematics, the natural numbers are the ordinary whole numbers used for counting ("there are 6 coins on the table") and ordering ("this is the 3rd largest city in the country"). These purposes are related to the linguistic notions of cardinal and ordinal numbers, respectively (see English numerals). A later notion is that of a nominal number, which is used only for naming.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Three_apples.svg/220px-Three_apples.svg.png
