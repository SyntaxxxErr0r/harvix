18.46	Whig_(British_political_faction)	Whig (British political party)	The Whigs were a party in the Parliament of England, Parliament of Great Britain, and Parliament of the United Kingdom, who contested power with the rival Tories from the 1680s to the 1850s. The Whigs' origin lay in constitutional monarchism and opposition to absolute rule. The Whigs played a central role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and were the standing enemies of the Stuart kings and pretenders, who were Roman Catholic. The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715, and remained totally dominant until King George III, coming to the throne in 1760, allowed Tories back in. The "Whig Supremacy" (1715-60) was enabled by the Hanoverian succession of George I in 1714 and the failed Jacobite rising of 1715 by Tory rebels. The Whigs thoroughly purged Tories from all major positions in government, the army, the Church of England, the legal profession and local officials. The great Whig leader was Robert Walpole, who controlled the government 1721-1742; his protege was Henry Pelham (1743-54).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/A-Block-for-the-Wigs-Gillray.jpeg/250px-A-Block-for-the-Wigs-Gillray.jpeg
