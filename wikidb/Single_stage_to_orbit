7.21	Single_stage_to_orbit	Single-stage-to-orbit	A single-stage-to-orbit (or SSTO) vehicle reaches orbit from the surface of a body without jettisoning hardware, expending only propellants and fluids. The term usually, but not exclusively, refers to reusable vehicles. No Earth-launched SSTO launch vehicles have ever been constructed. Current orbital launches are either performed by multi-stage fully or partially expendable rockets, or by the Space Shuttle which is multi-stage and partially reusable. Several research spacecraft have been designed and partially or completely constructed, including Skylon, the DC-X, the X-33, and the Roton SSTO. However, despite showing some promise, none of them has come close to achieving orbit yet due to problems with finding the most efficient propulsion system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Venturestar1.jpg/250px-Venturestar1.jpg
