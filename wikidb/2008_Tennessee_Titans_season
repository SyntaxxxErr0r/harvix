Despite being expected by most sportswriters to finish third or even fourth in the AFC South, they compiled a 13â€“3 regular season record and won home-field advantage for the duration of the playoffs. However, the Titans lost four of their last seven and were eliminated by the Baltimore Ravens in the divisional round.
