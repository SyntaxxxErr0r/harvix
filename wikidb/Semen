66.8	Semen	Semen	Semen is an organic fluid, also known as seminal fluid, that may contain spermatozoa. It is secreted by the gonads (sexual glands) and other sexual organs of male or hermaphroditic animals and can fertilize female ova. In humans, seminal fluid contains several components besides spermatozoa: proteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid which promote the survival of spermatozoa and provide a medium through which they can move or "swim".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Human_semen_in_petri_dish2.jpg/220px-Human_semen_in_petri_dish2.jpg
