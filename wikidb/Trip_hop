76.6	Trip_hop	Trip hop	Trip hop (or trip-hop) is a music genre consisting of downtempo electronic music which originated in the early 1990s in the UK, especially Bristol. Deriving from "post"-acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. According to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, the term was first used in 1989. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online also claims that the term was coined by Mixmag, a British magazine specialising in dance music. It has been described as "Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s", and "a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable." Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop from the United States, and it also contains elements of house, dance and dub reggae. Trip hop can be highly experimental in nature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Massive_attack_at_stereoleto.jpg/200px-Massive_attack_at_stereoleto.jpg
