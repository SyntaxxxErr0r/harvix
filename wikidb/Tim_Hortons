64.0	Tim_Hortons	Tim Hortons	Tim Hortons Inc. is a Canadian fast casual restaurant known for its coffee and doughnuts. It is also Canada's largest fast food service with over 3000 stores nationwide. It was founded in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario, by Canadian hockey player Tim Horton and Jim Charade (1934-2009), after an initial venture in hamburger restaurants. In 1967 Horton partnered with investor Ron Joyce, who assumed control over operations after Tim Horton died in a car crash in 1974, and expanded the chain into a multi-million dollar franchise. Jim Charade left the organization in 1966 and briefly returned in 1970 and 1993 through 1996.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Tim_Hortons_logo.svg/250px-Tim_Hortons_logo.svg.png
