110.2	Pregnancy	Pregnancy	Pregnancy is the fertilization and development of one or more offspring, known as an embryo or fetus, in a woman's uterus. In a pregnancy, there can be multiple gestations, as in the case of twins or triplets. Childbirth usually occurs about 38 weeks after conception; in women who have a menstrual cycle length of four weeks, this is approximately 40 weeks from the start of the last normal menstrual period (LNMP). Human pregnancy is the most studied of all mammalian pregnancies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/PregnantWoman.jpg/230px-PregnantWoman.jpg
