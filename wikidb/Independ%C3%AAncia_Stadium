2.00	Independ%C3%AAncia_Stadium	Estádio Independência	The Raimundo Sampaio stadium, usually known as Independência, is football stadium located in the Horto neighborhood in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. It was built in 1950 for the FIFA World Cup, held in Brazil. Initially its capacity was for 30,000 people. After the reconstruction between 2010/2012, the capacity is for 25,000 people. It belonged to the defunct Sete de Setembro Futebol Clube, which is why the stadium is called Independence (the name of the team, September 7, is Brazil's Independence Day). Currently it is property of América Futebol Clube, but has been leased to the Minas Gerais state government for 20 years, as counter part for the injection of public resources to demolish the old stadiu, and built the new one.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Independ%C3%AAncia_Stadium.jpg/250px-Independ%C3%AAncia_Stadium.jpg
