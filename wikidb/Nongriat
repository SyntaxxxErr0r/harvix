3.30	Nongriat	Nongriat	Nongriat is a village in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya State, in north-eastern India. It is perhaps best known for its two living root bridges; one an impressive double-decker suspension bridge called Jingkieng Nongriat. These are crafted by hand, as the Khasi people have done in the Khasi Hills for centuries, intertwining and weaving together the aerial roots of banyan trees on opposite sides of a stream-filled gorge. Jingkieng Nongriat, better known simply as Double Decker, has been featured on international television programs such as the Human Planet series filmed in 2008 by BBC Wales, and a documentary by Mr. Osamu Monden in June 2004 for Asahi TV in Japan. Near Nongriat, and best viewed from the neighboring village of Laitkynsew during the autumn monsoon season as a magnificent cascade, is the waterfall of Ka Likai. A succession of stone steps connect the community with neighboring village of Tyrna, just below the Cherrapunji-Laitkynsew bridle-path.
