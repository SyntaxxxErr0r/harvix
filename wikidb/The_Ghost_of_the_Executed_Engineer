The beginning of the book focuses on the life of Peter Palchinsky, born in 1875 in a city on the Volga, Kazan. He was a mining engineer who wished to take a more humanitarian approach to engineering than the communist government desired. The Ghost of the Executed Engineer was published by the Harvard University Press in 1993. While the book does cover the life of Peter Palchinky, a major part of the book personifies the struggles and misfortunes of the Soviet industrialization.
