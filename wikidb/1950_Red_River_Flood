Winnipeg, Manitoba was inundated on May 5, also known as Black Friday to some residents, and had to be partially evacuated. In that year, the Red River reached its highest level since 1861 and flooded most of the Red River Valley.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/81/Stvitalfirehall.jpg/200px-Stvitalfirehall.jpg
