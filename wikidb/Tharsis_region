1.00	Tharsis_region	Tharsis	The Tharsis region on Mars is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in Marsâ€™ western hemisphere. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at western extremity of the known world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/Tharsis-valles-s1.jpg/360px-Tharsis-valles-s1.jpg
