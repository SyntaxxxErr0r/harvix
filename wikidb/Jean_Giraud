88.1	Jean_Giraud	Jean Giraud	Jean Henri Gaston Giraud (8 May 1938 – 10 March 2012) was a French comics artist, working in the French tradition of bandes dessinées. Giraud earned worldwide fame, predominantly under the pseudonym Mœbius, and to a lesser extent Gir (used for the Blueberry series), the latter appearing mostly in the form of a boxed signature at the bottom of the artist's paintings. Esteemed by Federico Fellini, Stan Lee and Hayao Miyazaki among others, he received international acclaim. He has been described as the most influential bandes dessinées artist after Hergé.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Moebius_Lodz_2008.jpg/230px-Moebius_Lodz_2008.jpg
