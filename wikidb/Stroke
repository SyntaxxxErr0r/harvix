135.1	Stroke	Stroke	A stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident , is the rapid loss of brain function(s) due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. This can be due to ischemia (lack of blood flow) caused by blockage (thrombosis, arterial embolism), or a hemorrhage (leakage of blood). As a result, the affected area of the brain cannot function, which might result in an inability to move one or more limbs on one side of the body, inability to understand or formulate speech, or an inability to see one side of the visual field.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/INFARCT.jpg/230px-INFARCT.jpg
