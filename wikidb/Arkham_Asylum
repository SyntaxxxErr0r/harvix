59.6	Arkham_Asylum	Arkham Asylum	The Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane, commonly referred to simply as Arkham Asylum, is a fictional psychiatric hospital in the DC Comics Universe, usually appearing in stories featuring Batman. Many psychopathic criminals from across the DC Universe, mostly from Batman's own rogues gallery (such as the Joker, Poison Ivy, the Riddler, Two-Face, the Scarecrow, Bane, Killer Croc, and Harley Quinn) have been imprisoned within the Asylum and also escaped from it. The Arkham Asylum is named after the Sanatorium in the city of Arkham, Massachusetts, found in many of H.P. Lovecraft's short horror and science fiction stories, such as "The Colour Out of Space".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e8/Batman_Arkham_Asylum_Television_Credits.jpg/250px-Batman_Arkham_Asylum_Television_Credits.jpg
