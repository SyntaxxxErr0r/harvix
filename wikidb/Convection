107.8	Convection	Convection	Convection is the concerted, collective movement of ensembles of molecules within fluids (i.e. liquids, gases) and rheids. Convection of mass cannot take place in solids, since neither bulk current flows nor significant diffusion can take place in solids. Diffusion of heat can take place in solids, but is referred to separately in that case as heat conduction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Convection-snapshot.gif/400px-Convection-snapshot.gif
