52.1	Divine_right_of_kings	Divine right of kings	The divine right of kings, or divine-right theory of kingship, is a political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy. It asserts that a monarch is subject to no earthly authority, deriving his right to rule directly from the will of God. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or any other estate of the realm, including (in the view of some, especially in Protestant countries) the Church. According to this doctrine, only God can judge an unjust king. The doctrine implies that any attempt to depose the king or to restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Heraldic_Royal_Crown_%28Common%29.svg/100px-Heraldic_Royal_Crown_%28Common%29.svg.png
