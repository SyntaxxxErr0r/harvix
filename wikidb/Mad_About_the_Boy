3.70	Mad_About_the_Boy	Mad About the Boy	"Mad About the Boy" is a popular song with words and music by actor and playwright Sir Noël Coward. It was introduced in the 1932 revue Words and Music by Joyce Barbour, Steffi Duna, Norah Howard and Doris Hare. The song deals with the theme of unrequited love for a film star. It was written to be sung by female characters, although Coward also wrote a version, which was never performed, that contained references to the then risqué topic of homosexual love. The song gained new popularity in 1992 when Dinah Washington's rendition was used in the Levi's television advertisement "Swimmer", directed by Tarsem Singh.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Mad_about_the_boy_mercury19.jpg/220px-Mad_about_the_boy_mercury19.jpg
