1.00	Jehovas_Witnesses	Jehovah's Witnesses	Jehovah's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity. The religion reports worldwide membership of over 7.65 million adherents involved in evangelism, convention attendance of over 12 million, and annual Memorial attendance of over 19.3 million. They are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, a group of elders in Brooklyn, New York, that establishes and controls all doctrines. Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs are based on their interpretations of the Bible, with a preference for their own translation, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and that the establishment of God's kingdom on earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humankind.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Watchtower_Bible_%26_Tract_Society_%28world_headquarters%29.jpg/200px-Watchtower_Bible_%26_Tract_Society_%28world_headquarters%29.jpg
