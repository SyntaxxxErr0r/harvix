74.6	Edward_Teller	Edward Teller	Edward Teller provided an important stepping stone in the applications of this theory. The Jahn–Teller effect and the BET theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry. Teller also made contributions to Thomas–Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/EdwardTeller1958_fewer_smudges.jpg/220px-EdwardTeller1958_fewer_smudges.jpg
