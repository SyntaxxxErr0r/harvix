In the north of its range, it occurs from sea level to 1,000 m, while in the south of its range it is a high altitude mountain tree, growing at 1,200–2,600 m altitude. It is readily identified by its combination of fairly short, blue-green leaves and orange-red bark.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Pinus_sylvestris_Glenmuick.jpg/220px-Pinus_sylvestris_Glenmuick.jpg
