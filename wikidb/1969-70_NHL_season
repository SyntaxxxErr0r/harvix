2.10	1969-70_NHL_season	1969–70 NHL season	The 1969–70 NHL season was the 53rd season of the National Hockey League. For the third straight season, the St. Louis Blues reached the Stanley Cup finals, and for the third straight year, they were swept four games to none. This time, however, it was at the hands of the Boston Bruins, as the defending champions Montreal Canadiens narrowly missed the playoffs, something that would not happen again for the next quarter century. With the Leafs and Habs out, this meant that all participating teams in the 1970 playoffs were from the United States, the only time this has occurred as of 2011. It was also the final season that teams wore their colored jerseys at home until the 2003–04 season.
