55.1	Second_Battle_of_Fallujah	Second Battle of Fallujah	The Second Battle of Fallujah was a joint U.S., Iraqi, and British offensive in November and December 2004, considered the highest point of conflict in Fallujah during the Iraq War. It was led by the U.S. Marine Corps against the Iraqi insurgency stronghold in the city of Fallujah and was authorized by the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Interim Government. The U.S. military called it "some of the heaviest urban combat U.S. Marines have been involved in since the Battle of Huáº¿ City in Vietnam in 1968."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/USMC_469.jpg/300px-USMC_469.jpg
