10.61	Caramel_apple	Caramel apple	Caramel apples or taffy apples (not to be confused with candy apples) are created by dipping or rolling apples-on-a-stick in hot caramel, sometimes then rolling them in nuts or other small savories or confections, and allowing them to cool. Generally, they are called caramel apples when only caramel is applied and taffy apples for when there are further ingredients such as peanuts applied.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Caramel_Peanut_Candy_Apples_2592px.jpg/250px-Caramel_Peanut_Candy_Apples_2592px.jpg
