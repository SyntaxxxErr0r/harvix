1.00	Lowrie_Gang	Henry Berry Lowrie	Henry Berry Lowrie or "Lowry" (c. 1845 – February 20, 1872?) led an insurgent gang in North Carolina during and after the American Civil War. He is sometimes viewed as a Robin Hood type figure, especially by the Lumbee and Tuscarora people, who consider him an ancestor and a pioneer in the fight for civil rights and tribal self-determination. Lowrie was described by George Alfred Townsend, a late 19th-century New York Herald correspondent, as “ ne of those remarkable executive spirits that arises now and then in a raw community without advantages other than those given by nature."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Henry_Berry_Lowrie.jpg
