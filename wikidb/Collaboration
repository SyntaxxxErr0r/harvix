134.3	Collaboration	Collaboration	Collaboration is working together to achieve a goal. It is a recursive process where two or more people or organizations work together to realize shared goals, (this is more than the intersection of common goals seen in co-operative ventures, but a deep, collective, determination to reach an identical objective ) — for example, an intriguing endeavor that is creative in nature—by sharing knowledge, learning and building consensus. Most collaboration requires leadership, although the form of leadership can be social within a decentralized and egalitarian group. In particular, teams that work collaboratively can obtain greater resources, recognition and reward when facing competition for finite resources. Collaboration is also present in opposing goals exhibiting the notion of adversarial collaboration, though this is not a common case for using the word.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/The_farmer%27s_market_near_the_Potala_in_Lhasa.jpg/220px-The_farmer%27s_market_near_the_Potala_in_Lhasa.jpg
