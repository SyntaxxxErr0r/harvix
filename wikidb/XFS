76.2	XFS	XFS	XFS is a high-performance journaling file system created by Silicon Graphics, Inc. It is the default file system in IRIX releases 5.3 and onwards and later ported to the Linux kernel. XFS is particularly proficient at parallel IO due to its allocation group based design. This enables extreme scalability of IO threads, filesystem bandwidth, file and filesystem size when spanning multiple storage devices. A typical XFS user site, NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division takes advantage of these capabilities, deploying two 300+ terabyte XFS filesystems on two SGI Altix archival storage servers, each direct attached to multiple fiber channel disk arrays.
