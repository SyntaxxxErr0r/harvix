7.20	Makchang	Makchang gui	Makchang gui is the name of a Korean dish that consists of grilled pork (or beef) large intestines similar to chitterlings, but often grilled over coals. The small intestines are often called gopchang. They are often served with a light doenjang sauce and chopped scallions. High calcium content and high catabolism for alcohol makes it a favorite anju (side dish for drinking).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Korean.food-Makchang-02.jpg/220px-Korean.food-Makchang-02.jpg
