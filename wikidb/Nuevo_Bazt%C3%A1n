1.00	Nuevo_Bazt%C3%A1n	Nuevo Baztán	The Goyeneche Palace (Spanish: Palacio de Goyeneche or Palacio de Nuevo Baztán) is one of a number of palaces in Spain and Peru associated with the Goyeneche family . The palace was built to a Baroque design by José de Churriguera which incorporates a church. The palace-church and two plazas were protected as a conservation area in 1941, and the area of the conjunto histórico has since been extended to the rest of the historic centre. However, in 2007 it was reported that the palace was in a poor state of conservation. There have been proposals to restore it for use as an art gallery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Nuevo_Bazt%C3%A1n.jpg/200px-Nuevo_Bazt%C3%A1n.jpg
