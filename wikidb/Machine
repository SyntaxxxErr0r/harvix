107.1	Machine	Machine	A machine is a tool consisting of one or more parts that is constructed to achieve a particular goal. Machines are powered devices, usually mechanically, chemically, thermally or electrically powered, and are frequently motorized. Historically, a device required moving parts to classify as a machine; however, the advent of electronics technology has led to the development of devices without moving parts that are considered machines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Bonsack_machine.png/300px-Bonsack_machine.png
