4.11	DLX	DLX	The DLX is a RISC processor architecture designed by John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson, the principal designers of the MIPS and the Berkeley RISC designs (respectively), the two benchmark examples of RISC design. The DLX is essentially a cleaned up and simplified MIPS, with a simple 32-bit load/store architecture. Intended primarily for teaching purposes, the DLX design is widely used in university-level computer architecture courses.
