62.5	Adam	Adam	Adam (Hebrew: אָדָם‎, Arabic: آدم‎) is a figure in the Book of Genesis and the Qur'an. According to the creation myth of Abrahamic religions, he is the first human. In the Genesis creation narratives, he was created by Yahweh-Elohim ("Yahweh-God", the god of Israel), though the term "adam" can refer to both the first individual person, as well as to the general creation of humankind. Christian churches differ on how they view Adam's subsequent behavior (often called the Fall of man), and to the consequences that those actions had on the rest of humanity. Christian and Jewish teachings sometimes hold Adam and Eve (the first woman) to a different level of responsibility for the Fall, though Islamic teaching holds both equally responsible. In addition, Islam holds that Adam was eventually forgiven, while Christianity holds that no such redemption occurred. Islam and some Christian denominations consider Adam to be the first Prophet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/God2-Sistine_Chapel.png/350px-God2-Sistine_Chapel.png
