1.00	House_trailers	Mobile home	Mobile homes (in the United States; also called trailers or house trailers) or static caravans (in other countries; also called caravans) are prefabricated homes built in factories, rather than on site, and then taken to the place where they will be occupied. Being built on a permanently attached chassis with highway-grade wheels and tires, they are usually transported by being pulled behind a tractor-trailer over public roads to a home site. Mobile homes share the same historic origins as travel trailers, but today the two are very different in size and furnishings, with travel trailers being used primarily as temporary or vacation homes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Exterior_Sectional.jpg/400px-Exterior_Sectional.jpg
