1.00	Central_of_Georgia	Central of Georgia Railway	The Central of Georgia Railway started as the Central Rail Road and Canal Company in 1833. As a way to better attract investment capital, the railroad changed its name to Central Rail Road and Banking Company of Georgia. This railroad was constructed to join the Macon and Western Railroad at Macon, Georgia and run to Savannah, Georgia. This created a rail link from Chattanooga on the Tennessee River to seaports on the Atlantic Ocean. It took from 1837 to 1843 to finish this railroad all the way to Macon and until 1851 to get a bridge built across the Ocmulgee River.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Central_of_Georgia_Railway_Man_O_War_1951.JPG/220px-Central_of_Georgia_Railway_Man_O_War_1951.JPG
