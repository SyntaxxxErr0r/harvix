125.5	Telomere	Telomere	A telomere is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at the end of a chromosome, which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes. Its name is derived from the Greek nouns telos 'end' and merοs (μέρος, root: μερ-) 'part.' Telomere regions deter the degradation of genes near the ends of chromosomes by allowing chromosome ends to shorten, which necessarily occurs during chromosome replication. Over time, due to each cell division, the telomere ends do become shorter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Telomere_caps.gif/300px-Telomere_caps.gif
