63.1	Artery	Artery	Arteries (from the Greek ἀρτηρία - artēria, "windpipe, artery") are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. This blood is normally oxygenated, exceptions made for the pulmonary and umbilical arteries. The EABV is that ICF fluid which fills the arterial system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Arterial_System_en.svg/250px-Arterial_System_en.svg.png
