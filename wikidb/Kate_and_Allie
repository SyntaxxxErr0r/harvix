3.10	Kate_and_Allie	Kate &amp; Allie	Kate &amp; Allie is an American television situation comedy which ran from March 19, 1984 to May 22, 1989. Kate &amp; Allie first aired on CBS as a midseason replacement series and only six episodes were initially commissioned, but the favorable response from critics and viewers alike (its first episode ranked #4 out of all the television shows airing that week) easily convinced CBS to commit to a full season in the fall of 1984. The series was created by Sherry Coben.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Kate_%26_Allie.png/230px-Kate_%26_Allie.png
