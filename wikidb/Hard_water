63.7	Hard_water	Hard water	Hard water is water that has high mineral content (in contrast with “soft water”). Hard water is generally not harmful to one's health, but can pose serious problems in industrial settings, where water hardness is monitored to avoid costly breakdowns in boilers, cooling towers, and other equipment that handles water. In domestic settings, hard water is often indicated by a lack of suds formation when soap is agitated in water. Wherever water hardness is a concern, water softening is commonly used to reduce hard water's adverse effects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Hard_water_and_drop.jpg/300px-Hard_water_and_drop.jpg
