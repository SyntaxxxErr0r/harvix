2.20	Young_Fu_of_the_Upper_Yangtze	Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze	Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze is a book by Elizabeth Foreman Lewis that won the Newbery Medal for excellence in American children's literature in 1933. The story revolves around Fu Yuin-fah, the son of a widow from the countryside of western China, who wishes to become a coppersmith in the big city on the Yangtze River, Chungking (now spelled Chongqing). With the help of many people, including an old scholar and a white missionary, his goal is eventually attained. Perhaps because of its colonial overtones, this book has fallen out of favor on recommendation lists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/Young_Fu_cover.jpg/200px-Young_Fu_cover.jpg
