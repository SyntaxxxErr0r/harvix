60.7	Laser_printer	Laser printer	A laser printer is a common computer peripheral that rapidly produces high quality text and graphics on plain paper. As with digital photocopiers and multifunction printers (MFPs), laser printers employ a xerographic printing process, but differ from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of a laser beam across the printer's photoreceptor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Hp_laserjet_4200dtns.jpg/250px-Hp_laserjet_4200dtns.jpg
