64.1	Spelt	Spelt	Spelt is a hexaploid species of wheat. Spelt was an important staple in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval times; it now survives as a relict crop in Central Europe and northern Spain and has found a new market as a health food. Spelt is sometimes considered a subspecies of the closely related species common wheat (T. aestivum), in which case its botanical name is considered to be Triticum aestivum subsp. spelta.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Spelt.jpg/220px-Spelt.jpg
