52.4	Cross-browser	Cross-browser	Cross-browser refers to the ability for a website, web application, HTML construct or client-side script to function correctly across all, or the majority of web browsers. The term cross-browser is often confused with multi-browser. Multi-browser is a new paradigm in web development that allows a website or web application to provide more functionality over several web browsers, while ensuring that the website or web application is accessible to the largest possible audience without any loss in performance. Cross-browser capability allows a website or web application to be properly rendered by all browsers. The term cross-browser has existed since web development began.
