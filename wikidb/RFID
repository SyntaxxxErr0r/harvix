323.1	RFID	Radio-frequency identification	Radio-frequency identification is the use of a wireless non-contact system that uses radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data from a tag attached to an object, for the purposes of automatic identification and tracking. Some tags require no battery and are powered by the electromagnetic fields used to read them. Others use a local power source and emit radio waves (electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies). The tag contains electronically stored information which can be read from up to several metres (yards) away. Unlike a bar code, the tag does not need to be within line of sight of the reader and may be embedded in the tracked object.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Microchip_rfid_rice.jpg/220px-Microchip_rfid_rice.jpg
