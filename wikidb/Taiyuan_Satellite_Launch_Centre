1.00	Taiyuan_Satellite_Launch_Centre	Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center	The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center (TSLC) also known as Base 25 (二十五基地), is a People's Republic of China space and defence launch facility (spaceport). It is situated in Kelan County, Xinzhou Prefecture, Shanxi Province and is the second of three launch sites having been founded in March 1966 and coming into full operation in 1968. Taiyuan sits at an altitude of 1500 meters and its dry weather makes it an ideal launch site. Confusingly, U.S. intelligence designates TSLC the 'Wuzhai Missile and Space Test Centre," despite the fact that the town of Wuzhai is located a considerable distance from the Taiyuan space launch facility.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Location_of_Xinzhou_Prefecture_within_Shanxi_%28China%29.png/220px-Location_of_Xinzhou_Prefecture_within_Shanxi_%28China%29.png
