67.5	Backscatter_X-ray	Backscatter X-ray	Backscatter X-ray is an advanced X-ray imaging technology. Traditional X-ray machines detect hard and soft materials by the variation in transmission through the target. In contrast, backscatter X-ray detects the radiation that reflects from the target. It has potential applications where less-destructive examination is required, and can be used if only one side of the target is available for examination.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Backscatter_large.jpg/220px-Backscatter_large.jpg
