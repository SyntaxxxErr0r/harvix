8.10	Zoji_La	Zoji La	Zoji La (Hindi: ) is a high mountain pass in India, located on the Indian National Highway 1 between Srinagar and Leh in the western section of the Himalayan mountain range. Though often referred to as Zojila Pass in the foreign press, the correct English translation is Zoji Pass or simply Zojila, since the suffix 'La' itself means pass in several Himalayan languages. In modern-day North Indian languages, 'La' (ला) and 'Darra' (दर्रा) are both used interchangeably to mean pass.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/A_view_from_Zoji_La.jpg/280px-A_view_from_Zoji_La.jpg
