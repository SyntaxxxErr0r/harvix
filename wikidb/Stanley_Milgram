103.7	Stanley_Milgram	Stanley Milgram	Stanley Milgram (August 15, 1933 â€“ December 20, 1984) was an American social psychologist most notable for his controversial study known as the Milgram Experiment. The study was conducted in the 1960s during Milgram's professorship at Yale. Milgram was influenced by the events of the Nazi Holocaust to carry out an experiment that would demonstrate the relationship between obedience and authority. Prior to the obedience experiment, Milgram conducted the small-world experiment (the source of the six degrees of separation concept) as part of his dissertation while at Harvard.
