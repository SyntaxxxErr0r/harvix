1.00	Ottawa_Street_(Hamilton,_Ontario)	Ottawa Street (Hamilton, Ontario)	Ottawa street, is a Lower City arterial road in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It starts off at Lawrence Road at the base of the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) and is a two-way street throughout cutting through the Delta and Crown Point neighbourhoods and the City's North End industrial neighbourhood. It ends at Industrial Drive, the site of the Dofasco steel company. This used to be one of the east ends' mountain access roads - it continued south over the train tracks at Lawrence Road and quickly turned right towards the brick manufacturing plant once known as Hamilton Brick. It took several turns before joining what is now the Kenilworth Access near the old water reservoir entrance. Its' routing up the mountain is fairly consistent with the current Kenilworth Access with one exception - another hair-pin turn at the top; not the traffic circle that we know today. It was because of these hair-pin turns that the Hamilton Street Railway discontinued bus service on this road in 1944, and why the City planned the "new" Kenilworth Access to the east which opened in 1957.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/OttawaStreetHamiltonA.JPG/400px-OttawaStreetHamiltonA.JPG
