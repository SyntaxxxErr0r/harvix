3.10	F_is_for_Fake	F for Fake	F for Fake (French: , "Truths and lies") is the last major film completed by Orson Welles, who directed, co-wrote, and starred in the film. Initially released in 1974, it focuses on Elmyr de Hory's recounting of his career as a professional art forger; de Hory's story serves as the backdrop for a fast-paced, meandering investigation of the natures of authorship and authenticity, as well as the basis of the value of art. Loosely a documentary, the film operates in several different genres and has been described as a kind of film essay.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/F_for_Fake_poster.jpg/220px-F_for_Fake_poster.jpg
