86.4	Badminton	Badminton	Badminton is a racquet sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their racquet so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Badminton_Peter_Gade.jpg/200px-Badminton_Peter_Gade.jpg
