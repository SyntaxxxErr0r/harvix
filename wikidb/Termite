72.4	Termite	Termite	Termites are a group of eusocial insects that, until recently, were classified at the taxonomic rank of order Isoptera (see taxonomy below), but are now accepted as the epifamily Termitoidae, of the cockroach order Blattodea. While termites are commonly known, especially in Australia, as "white ants," they are only distantly related to the ants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Coptotermes_formosanus_shiraki_USGov_k8204-7.jpg/220px-Coptotermes_formosanus_shiraki_USGov_k8204-7.jpg
