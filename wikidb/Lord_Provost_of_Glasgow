3.21	Lord_Provost_of_Glasgow	Lord Provost of Glasgow	The Right Honourable Lord Provost of Glasgow is the convener of the Glasgow City Council. They are elected by the city councillors and serve not only as the chair of that body, but as a figurehead for the entire city. They are equivalent in many ways to the institution of Mayor that exists in many other countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg/175px-Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png
