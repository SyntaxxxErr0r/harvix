20.43	Bailiwick	Bailiwick	A bailiwick is usually the area of jurisdiction of a bailiff, and may also apply to a territory in which the sheriff's functions were exercised by a privately appointed bailiff under a royal or imperial writ. The word is now more generally used in a metaphorical sense, to indicate a sphere of authority, experience, activity, study or interest. A bailiwick (German: ) was also the territorial division of the Teutonic Order. Here, various “Komtur(en)” formed a Ballei province.
