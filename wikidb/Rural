65.4	Rural	Rural area	Rural areas or the country or countryside are areas of land that are not urbanized, though when large areas are described, country towns and smaller cities will be included. They have a low population density, and typically much of the land is devoted to agriculture and there may be less air and water pollution than in an urban area. The degree to which areas of wilderness are included in the term varies; very large wilderness areas are not likely to be described by the term in most contexts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Barossa_Valley_South_Australia.jpg/300px-Barossa_Valley_South_Australia.jpg
