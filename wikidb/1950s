89.0	1950s	1950s	The 1950s or The Fifties was the decade that began on January 1, 1950 and ended on December 31, 1959. This was the sixth decade of the 20th century. By its end, the world had largely recovered from World War II and the Cold War developed from its modest beginning in the late 1940s to a hot competition between the United States and the Soviet Union by the beginning of the 1960s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/1950s_decade_montage.PNG/420px-1950s_decade_montage.PNG
