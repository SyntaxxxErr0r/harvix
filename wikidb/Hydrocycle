2.00	Hydrocycle	Hydrocycle	A hydrocycle is bicycle-like watercraft. Power is collected from the rider via a crank with pedals, as on a bicycle, and delivered to the water or the air via a propeller. Seating may be upright or recumbent, and multiple riders may be accommodated in tandem or side-by-side. Buoyancy is provided by two or more pontoons or a single surfboard, and some have hydrofoils that can lift the these floatation devices out of the water. Brand names include Seacycle, Hydrobike, Water bike, and itBike. Kits exist to convert an existing bicycle into a hydrocycle temporarily.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Seacycle.jpg/220px-Seacycle.jpg
