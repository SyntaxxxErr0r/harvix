7.30	Takehisa_Yumeji	Yumeji Takehisa	Yumeji Takehisa Takehisa Yumeji, September 16, 1884 â€“ September 1, 1934), was a Japanese poet and painter. Takehisa died in 1934 at the age of 49. He never studied drawing in any painting school nor under any teacher formally. He hated the concept of the 'artist', feeling they were rather pretentious which unsurprisingly upset many of the artists of his time, leading to poor reviews from the so-called elite.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Yumeji_Takehisa.JPG/220px-Yumeji_Takehisa.JPG
