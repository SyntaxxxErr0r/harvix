Playing as a member of the Southern Conference (SoCon), the team was led by head coach Robert Neyland, in his fourth year, and played their home games at Shields-Watkins Field in Knoxville, Tennessee. The 1928 Vols won nine, lost zero and tied one game (9–0–1 overall, 6–0–1 in the SoCon). In a virtual repeat of the previous year, a tie with Kentucky spoiled Tennessee's perfect season. Playing eight home games, the Volunteers outscored their opponents 330 to 13 and posted eight shutouts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/UT_Volunteers_logo.svg/100px-UT_Volunteers_logo.svg.png
