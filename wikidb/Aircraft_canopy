13.11	Aircraft_canopy	Aircraft canopy	An aircraft canopy is the transparent enclosure over the cockpit of some types of aircraft. The function of the canopy is to provide a weatherproof and reasonably quiet environment for the aircraft's occupants. The canopy will be as aerodynamically shaped as possible to minimize drag.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/F-22_cockpit_close-up.jpg/300px-F-22_cockpit_close-up.jpg
