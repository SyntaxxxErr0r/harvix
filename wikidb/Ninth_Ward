The portion of the Ninth Ward along the river down-river from the Industrial Canal stretching to the St. Bernard line is called the "Lower 9th Ward" or "Lower Ninth". It includes the Holy Cross neighborhood, the twin Doullut Steamboat Houses and the Jackson Barracks. Until Hurricane Katrina, the Lower Ninth Ward had the highest percentage of black home ownership in the city.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/BywaterArchBurgundy2.jpg/200px-BywaterArchBurgundy2.jpg
