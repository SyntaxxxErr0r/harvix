195.4	William_Randolph_Hearst	William Randolph Hearst	William Randolph Hearst (April 29, 1863 – August 14, 1951) was an American business magnate and a leading newspaper publisher. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887, after taking control of The San Francisco Examiner from his father. Moving to New York City, he acquired The New York Journal and engaged in a bitter circulation war with Joseph Pulitzer's New York World which led to the creation of yellow journalism — sensationalized stories of dubious veracity. Acquiring more newspapers, Hearst created a chain that numbered nearly 30 papers in major American cities at its peak. He later expanded to magazines, creating the largest newspaper and magazine business in the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/William_Randolph_Hearst_cph_3a49373.jpg/170px-William_Randolph_Hearst_cph_3a49373.jpg
