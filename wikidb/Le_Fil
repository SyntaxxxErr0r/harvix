4.00	Le_Fil	Le Fil	Le Fil is the second album by French singer Camille. The title translates as "The Thread". The album features a 'tone', a low-level drone that is in the background of every song, which Camille has described as 'her note'. The note is a B. The singer also mentioned that many people returned the record, thinking this sound was a fault with the recording. The title also arises due to the similar word 'fille' or girl which arises in a lot of the songs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/LeFilCamille.jpg/220px-LeFilCamille.jpg
