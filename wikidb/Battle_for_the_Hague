2.00	Battle_for_the_Hague	Battle for The Hague	The Battle for the Hague was the first paratroop assault in history. It took place on 10 May 1940 as part of the Battle of the Netherlands between the Royal Netherlands Army and Luftwaffe Fallschirmj√§ger (paratroops). German paratroopers dropped in and around The Hague and were given orders to capture Dutch airfields and the city. After taking the city, the plan was to force the Dutch queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to surrender and to thus defeat the Dutch within a single day. The operation failed to capture the Dutch Queen, and the German forces found themselves surrounded by heavily armed forces protecting the airfields. However, with the help of the Luftwaffe, they repulsed all attempts by Dutch forces to destroy the airborne units in the pocket and held out until relieved by German Army forces.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/German_PLane_Destroyed.jpg/300px-German_PLane_Destroyed.jpg
