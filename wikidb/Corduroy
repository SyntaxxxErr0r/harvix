34.76	Corduroy	Corduroy	Corduroy is a textile composed of twisted fibers that, when woven, lie parallel (similar to twill) to one another to form the cloth's distinct pattern, a "cord." Modern corduroy is most commonly composed of tufted cords, sometimes exhibiting a channel (bare to the base fabric) between the tufts. Corduroy is, in essence, a ridged form of velvet. The word corduroy originates in fact from medieval times, where kings would prefer to wear corduroy, so it was understandably named: le corde du roi (from French, the cord of the King). After years of bearing this name, it eventually became Corduroy due to mispronunciation or simplifying the word.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Mansestr.jpg/220px-Mansestr.jpg
