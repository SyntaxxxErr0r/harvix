51.3	Ballets_Russes	Ballets Russes	The Ballets Russes was an itinerant ballet company from Russia which performed between 1909 and 1929 in many countries. Directed by Sergei Diaghilev, it is regarded as the greatest ballet company of the 20th century. Many of its dancers originated from the Imperial Ballet of Saint Petersburg. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, younger dancers came from those trained in Paris, within the community of exiles. The company featured and premiered now-famous (and sometimes notorious) works by the great choreographers Marius Petipa and Michel Fokine, as well as new works by Bronislava Nijinska, LÃ©onide Massine, Vaslav Nijinsky, and the young George Balanchine at the start of his career.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Macke_Russisches_Ballett_1.jpg/200px-Macke_Russisches_Ballett_1.jpg
