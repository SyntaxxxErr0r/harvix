51.5	Tone_mapping	Tone mapping	Tone mapping is a technique used in image processing and computer graphics to map one set of colors to another in order to approximate the appearance of high dynamic range images in a medium that has a more limited dynamic range. Print-outs, CRT or LCD monitors, and projectors all have a limited dynamic range that is inadequate to reproduce the full range of light intensities present in natural scenes. Essentially, tone mapping addresses the problem of strong contrast reduction from the scene values to the displayable range while preserving the image details and color appearance important to appreciate the original scene content.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Dundus_Square.jpg/250px-Dundus_Square.jpg
