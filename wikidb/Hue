51.7	Hue	Hue	Hue is one of the main properties of a color, defined technically (in the CIECAM02 model), as "the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red, green, blue, and yellow," (the unique hues). The other main correlatives of color appearance are colorfulness, chroma, saturation, lightness, and brightness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/HueScale.svg/360px-HueScale.svg.png
