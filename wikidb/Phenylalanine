52.8	Phenylalanine	Phenylalanine	Phenylalanine (abbreviated as Phe or F) is an Î±-amino acid with the formula C6H5CH2CH(NH2)COOH. This essential amino acid is classified as nonpolar because of the hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. L-Phenylalanine (LPA) is an electrically neutral amino acid, one of the twenty common amino acids used to biochemically form proteins, coded for by DNA. The codons for L-phenylalanine are UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine signaling molecules dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the skin pigment melanin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Phenylalanin_-_Phenylalanine.svg/180px-Phenylalanin_-_Phenylalanine.svg.png
