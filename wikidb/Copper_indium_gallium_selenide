56.4	Copper_indium_gallium_selenide	Copper indium gallium selenide	Copper indium gallium (di)selenide is a I-III-VI2 semiconductor material composed of copper, indium, gallium, and selenium. The material is a solid solution of copper indium selenide (often abbreviated "CIS") and copper gallium selenide. It has a chemical formula of CuInxGa(1-x)Se2 where the value of x can vary from 1 (pure copper indium selenide) to 0 (pure copper gallium selenide). CIGS is a tetrahedrally bonded semiconductor, with the chalcopyrite crystal structure, and a bandgap varying continuously with x from about 1.0 eV (for copper indium selenide) to about 1.7 eV (for copper gallium selenide). It is used as light absorber material for thin-film solar cells.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Chalcopyrite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png/200px-Chalcopyrite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png
