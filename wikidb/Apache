57.6	Apache	Apache	Apache (French: ) is the collective term for several culturally related groups of Native Americans in the United States originally from the Southwest United States. These indigenous peoples of North America speak a Southern Athabaskan (Apachean) language, which is related linguistically to the languages of Athabaskan speakers of Alaska and western Canada. The modern term Apache excludes the related Navajo people. Since the Navajo and the other Apache groups are clearly related through culture and language, they are all considered Apachean. Apachean peoples formerly ranged over eastern Arizona, northern Mexico, New Mexico, west and southwest Texas and southern Colorado. The Apacher√≠a, consisted of high mountains, sheltered and watered valleys, deep canyons, deserts and the southern Great Plains.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Apache_portraits.jpg/270px-Apache_portraits.jpg
