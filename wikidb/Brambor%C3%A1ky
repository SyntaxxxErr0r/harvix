1.00	Brambor%C3%A1ky	Potato pancake	Potato pancakes are shallow-fried pancakes of grated or ground potato, flour and egg, often flavored with grated onion or garlic and seasoning. Potato pancakes may be topped with a variety of condiments, ranging from the savory (such as sour cream or cottage cheese) to the sweet (such as apple sauce or sugar), or they may be served ungarnished. Potato pancakes are sometimes made from mashed potatoes to produce pancake-shaped croquettes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Latkes.jpg/255px-Latkes.jpg
