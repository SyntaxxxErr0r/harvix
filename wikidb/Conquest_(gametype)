2.21	Conquest_(gametype)	Conquest (gametype)	Conquest is a gametype used mainly by Electronic Arts and Digital Illusions CE's Battlefield franchise. To win a game of Conquest, the teams in the game (usually two) must capture pre-determined spawnpoints (referred to as control points or outposts ingame) labeled by flags. Depending on the amount of team members in the capture radius of a flag, the capture meter will fill faster, thereby shortening the time of capture. While capturing, it is possible for the enemy to pause or slow down the capture. A 1:1 ratio of enemies and friendlies in the area will cause the capture to pause, otherwise the capture will slowly go to the team with more members in the area. The speed or direction of capture will not change until members leave the area or are killed. Once a control point is captured, a player can then choose to spawn in that location.
