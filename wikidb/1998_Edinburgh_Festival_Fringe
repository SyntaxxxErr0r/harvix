Established in 1947 as an alternative to the Edinburgh International Festival, it takes place annually in Scotland's capital, in the month of August. The Fringe is a showcase for the performing arts, particularly theatre and comedy (which has seen substantial growth in recent years), although dance and music are also represented. In 2009, 35% of shows were comedy and 28% theatrical productions. Theatrical productions range from the classics of ancient Greece, William Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett to modern works. In 2009, 37% of shows were having their world premiere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Edinburgh_Fringe_037.jpg/220px-Edinburgh_Fringe_037.jpg
