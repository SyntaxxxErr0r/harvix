60.7	RMS_Queen_Mary	RMS Queen Mary	RMS Queen Mary is a retired ocean liner that sailed primarily in the North Atlantic Ocean from 1936 to 1967 for the Cunard Line (known as Cunard-White Star when the vessel entered service). Built by John Brown &amp; Company in Clydebank, Scotland, Queen Mary along with her running mate, the RMS Queen Elizabeth, were built as part of Cunard's planned two-ship weekly express service between Southampton, Cherbourg, and New York City. The two ships were a British response to the superliners built by German and French companies in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Queen Mary was the flagship of the Cunard Line from May 1936 until October 1946 when she was replaced by Queen Elizabeth. The vessel also held the Blue Riband from 1936 to 1937 and then from 1938 to 1952 when she was beaten by the new SS United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/RMS_Queen_Mary_Long_Beach_January_2011_view.jpg/300px-RMS_Queen_Mary_Long_Beach_January_2011_view.jpg
