6.11	Jacklyn_H._Lucas	Jacklyn H. Lucas	Private First Class Jacklyn Harold Lucas (14 February 1928 – 5 June 2008) was a United States Marine who received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during the Iwo Jima campaign — for unhesitatingly hurling himself over his comrades upon one grenade and for pulling another one under himself. One of the grenades exploded, and Lucas absorbed the entire blasting force of it with his own body. Private First Class Lucas, the youngest Marine ever to receive the United States' highest military decoration, and the youngest of any branch of the military other than the Civil War, was presented the award by President Harry S. Truman at the White House on Friday, 5 October 1945.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Lucas_JH_USMC_Medal_of_Honor_Flag_August_2006.jpg/220px-Lucas_JH_USMC_Medal_of_Honor_Flag_August_2006.jpg
