96.5	Year_2038_problem	Year 2038 problem	The year 2038 problem (also known as the Unix Millennium Bug , Y2K38 or Y2.038K by analogy to the Y2K problem) may cause some computer software to fail at some point near the year 2038. The problem affects all software and systems that both store system time as a signed 32-bit integer, and interpret this number as the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970. The furthest time that can be represented this way is 03:14:07 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038. Times beyond this moment will "wrap around" and be stored internally as a negative number, which these systems will interpret as a date in 1901 rather than 2038. This is caused by integer overflow. The counter "runs out" of usable digits, "increments" the sign bit instead, and reports a maximally negative number (continuing to count up, toward zero). This will likely cause problems for users of these systems due to erroneous calculations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Year_2038_problem.gif
