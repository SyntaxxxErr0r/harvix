In the fall of 2006, amid controversy surrounding his work on the collapse of the World Trade Center (Jones produced alleged evidence showing the buildings were destroyed by controlled demolition during the September 11 attacks), he was relieved of his teaching duties and placed on paid leave from Brigham Young University. He retired on October 20, 2006 with the status of Professor Emeritus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Steven_Jones_UCBerkeley.jpg/240px-Steven_Jones_UCBerkeley.jpg
