89.1	Hydrolysis	Hydrolysis	Hydrolysis (from Greek roots hydro "water" + lysis "separation") is a chemical reaction during which molecules of water (H2O) are split into hydrogen cations (H+, conventionally referred to as protons) and hydroxide anions (OHâˆ’) in the process of a chemical mechanism. It is the type of reaction that is used to break down certain polymers, especially those made by condensation polymerization. Such polymer degradation is usually catalysed by either acid, e.g., concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), or alkali, e.g., sodium hydroxide (NaOH).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Amide_hydrolysis.svg/512px-Amide_hydrolysis.svg.png
