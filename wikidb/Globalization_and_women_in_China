Globalization refers to the interaction and integration of people, products, cultures and governments between various nations around the globe; this is fostered by trade, investment, and information technology. Globalization affected women's rights and the gender hierarchy in China, in aspects of domestic life such as marriage and primogeniture, as well as in the workplace. These changes altered the quality of life and the availability of opportunities to women at different junctures throughout the modern globalization process.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/People%27s_Republic_of_China_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/150px-People%27s_Republic_of_China_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png
