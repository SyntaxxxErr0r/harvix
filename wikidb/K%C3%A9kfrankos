6.21	K%C3%A9kfrankos	Blaufränkisch	Blaufränkisch is a dark-skinned variety of grape used for red wine. Blaufränkisch, which is a late-ripening variety gives red wines which are typically rich in tannin and may exhibit a pronounced spicy character. The grape is grown across Central Europe, including Austria, Czech Republic (in particular southern Moravia where it is known as Frankovka), Germany (where it is known as Lemberger, or Blauer Limberger), Slovakia (where it is known as "Frankovka modrá"), Croatia ("frankovka") and Slovenia (known as "modra frankinja"). In Hungary the grape is called Kékfrankos (also lit. blue Frankish) and is grown in a number of wine regions including Sopron, Villány, Szekszárd, and Eger (where it is a major ingredient in the famous red wine blend known as Egri Bikavér (lit. Bull's Blood) having largely replaced the Kadarka grape). It has been called "the Pinot Noir of the East" because of its spread and reputation in Eastern Europe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Blaufrankisch_close_up.JPG/215px-Blaufrankisch_close_up.JPG
