75.5	Extremophile	Extremophile	An extremophile (from Latin meaning "extreme" and Greek () meaning "love") is an organism that thrives in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most life on Earth. In contrast, organisms that live in more moderate environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles. The category name is unfortunate as it calls for subjective judgements of two issues - firstly, the degree of deviation from 'normal' justifying the use of 'extreme', and secondly, whether the organism prefers the environment or merely tolerates it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Grand_prismatic_spring.jpg/300px-Grand_prismatic_spring.jpg
