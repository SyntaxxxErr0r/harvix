53.8	Global_navigation_satellite_system	Satellite navigation	A satellite navigation or SAT NAV system is a system of satellites that provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location to within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a line-of-sight by radio from satellites. Receivers calculate the precise time as well as position, which can be used as a reference for scientific experiments. A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a global navigation satellite system or GNSS.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Accuracy_of_Navigation_Systems.svg/300px-Accuracy_of_Navigation_Systems.svg.png
