106.5	Kevlar	Kevlar	Kevlar is the registered trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber, related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora. Developed at DuPont in 1965, this high strength material was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Kevlar-3D-balls.png/250px-Kevlar-3D-balls.png
