20.82	TrackMania	TrackMania	TrackMania is a series of racing games for the Windows PC, Nintendo DS and Wii platforms, originally developed by the French team Nadeo for the PC. Instead of following the usual trend of choosing a set car and track to play the game, in TrackMania the players can create their own tracks using a "building block" process similar to that of the 1984 game Excitebike, the 1985 game Racing Destruction Set and the 1990 Br√∏derbund release, Stunts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Trackmania_screenshot.jpg/180px-Trackmania_screenshot.jpg
