51.6	Self-similarity	Self-similarity	In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e. the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales. Self-similarity is a typical property of fractals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Kochsim.gif
