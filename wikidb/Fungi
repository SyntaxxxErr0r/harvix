103.0	Fungi	Fungus	A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is a member of a large group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds , that share a common ancestor (a monophyletic group). This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar myxomycetes (slime molds) and oomycetes (water molds). The discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi is known as mycology, which is often regarded as a branch of botany, even though genetic studies have shown that fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Fungi_collage.jpg/280px-Fungi_collage.jpg
