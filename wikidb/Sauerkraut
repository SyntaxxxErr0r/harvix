107.8	Sauerkraut	Sauerkraut	Sauerkraut is made by a process of pickling called lacto-fermentation that is analogous to how traditional (not heat-treated) pickled cucumbers and kimchi are made. Fully cured sauerkraut keeps for several months in an airtight container stored at or below 15 °C (60 °F). Neither refrigeration nor pasteurization is required, although these treatments prolong storage life. German sauerkraut is often flavoured with Juniper berries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Kiszona_kapusta.JPG/220px-Kiszona_kapusta.JPG
