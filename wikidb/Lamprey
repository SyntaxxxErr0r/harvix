77.0	Lamprey	Lamprey	Lampreys (sometimes also called lamprey eels) are a family of jawless fish, whose adults are characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. Translated from a mixture of Latin and Greek, lamprey means stone lickers (lambere: to lick, and petra: stone). While lampreys are well-known for those species which bore into the flesh of other fish to suck their blood, most species of lamprey are not parasitic and never feed on other fish. In zoology, lampreys are sometimes not considered to be true fish because of their distinctive morphology and physiology. The lampreys are the basal group of Vertebrata (hagfishes are actually not vertebrates, but craniates).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Diversas_lampreas.1_-_Aquarium_Finisterrae.JPG/300px-Diversas_lampreas.1_-_Aquarium_Finisterrae.JPG
