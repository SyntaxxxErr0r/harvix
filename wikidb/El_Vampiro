4.10	El_Vampiro	El Vampiro	El vampiro (English: ) is a 1957 Mexican horror film, directed by Fernando MÃ©ndez. The film is about Marta, a young woman, who travels to her childhood village, only to find that one of her aunts is dead and another is under the influence of Mr. Duval, who later turns out to be a vampire whose name is the Count Karol de Lavud. It is possibly the first movie to actually show a vampire with elongated canines. F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu had elongated incisors; Tod Browning's Dracula (Bela Lugosi) did not show his teeth at all.
