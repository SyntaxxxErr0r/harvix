He is one of the seven archangels in Eastern Orthodox tradition, and in traditional folk Catholicism. When depicted in iconography by himself or with individual characteristics, he is shown in an attitude of humble prayer, with downcast eyes and arms crossed over his breast. Prayer is considered his special attribute, and Orthodox Christians will seek his help if their prayer is suffering from distractions, inattentiveness, or coldness. In Catholic Tradition, he is depicted as a thurifer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Archangels.JPG/200px-Archangels.JPG
