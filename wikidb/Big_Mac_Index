104.1	Big_Mac_Index	Big Mac Index	The Big Mac Index is published by The Economist as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and provides a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It "seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/BigMacCroatia.jpg/220px-BigMacCroatia.jpg
