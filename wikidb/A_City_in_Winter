Though considered a children's novel, the book is mixture of war story and bureaucratic satire, telling the story of a 10-year-old queen's quest to regain her throne in a country that strongly parallels Russia at the beginning of the Russian Revolution of 1917.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/A_City_in_Winter.jpg/225px-A_City_in_Winter.jpg
