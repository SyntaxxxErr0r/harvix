In later years, Kane acknowledged Finger as "a contributing force" in the character's creation, and comics historian Ron Goulart has referred to Batman as the "creation of artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger". A DC Comics press release in 2007 stated that, "Kane, along with writer Bill Finger, had just created Batman for DC predecessor National Comics."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Bill_Finger_by_Jerry_Robinson.jpg/168px-Bill_Finger_by_Jerry_Robinson.jpg
