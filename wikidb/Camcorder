52.5	Camcorder	Camcorder	A camcorder (formally a video camera recorder) is an electronic device that combines a video camera and a video recorder into one unit; typically for out-of-studio consumer video recording. Equipment manufacturers do not seem to have strict guidelines for the term usage; for instance marketing materials may present the device by its colloquial term camcorder, while full name on the package and manual is often video camera recorder.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Canon_HF10_front.jpg/220px-Canon_HF10_front.jpg
