1.00	8-Methoxypsoralen	Methoxsalen	Methoxsalen (also called xanthotoxin, marketed under the trade names Oxsoralen, Deltasoralen, Meladinine) is a drug used to treat psoriasis, eczema, vitiligo, and some cutaneous Lymphomas in conjunction with exposing the skin to sunlight. Methoxsalen is extracted from Ammi majus, a plant of the family Apiaceae. Methoxsalen modifies the way skin cells receive the UVA radiation, allegedly clearing up the disease. The dosage comes in 10 mg tablets, which are taken in the amount of 30 mg 75 minutes before a PUVA light treatment. The substance is also present in other Apiaceae as well as Rutaceae, for example bergamot oil which is used in many perfumes and aromatherapy oils.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Methoxsalen.svg/220px-Methoxsalen.svg.png
