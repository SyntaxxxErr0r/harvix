167.3	Computer_file	Computer file	A computer file is a block of arbitrary information, or resource for storing information, which is available to a computer program and is usually based on some kind of durable storage. A file is durable in the sense that it remains available for programs to use after the current program has finished. Computer files can be considered as the modern counterpart of paper documents which traditionally are kept in offices' and libraries' files, and this is the source of the term.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/PunchCardDecks.agr.jpg/220px-PunchCardDecks.agr.jpg
