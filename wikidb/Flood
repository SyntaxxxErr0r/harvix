99.7	Flood	Flood	A flood is an overflow of an expanse of water that submerges land. The European Union (EU) Floods Directive defines a flood as a covering by water of land not normally covered by water. In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Flooding may result from the volume of water within a body of water, such as a river or lake, which overflows or breaks levees, with the result that some of the water escapes its usual boundaries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Erschrecklichewasserfluth.jpg/220px-Erschrecklichewasserfluth.jpg
