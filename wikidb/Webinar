112.7	Webinar	Web conferencing	Web conferencing refers to a service that allows conferencing events to be shared with remote locations. In general the service is made possible by Internet technologies, particularly on TCP/IP connections. The service allows real-time point-to-point communications as well as multicast communications from one sender to many receivers. It offers information of text-based messages, voice and video chat to be shared simultaneously, across geographically dispersed locations. Applications for web conferencing include meetings, training events, lectures, or short presentations from any computer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Lee_Odden_on_Twebinar.jpg/220px-Lee_Odden_on_Twebinar.jpg
