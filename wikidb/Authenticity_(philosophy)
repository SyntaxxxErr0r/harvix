53.8	Authenticity_(philosophy)	Authenticity (philosophy)	Authenticity is a technical term in existentialist philosophy, and is also used in the philosophy of art and psychology. In philosophy, the conscious self is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself. Authenticity is the degree to which one is true to one's own personality, spirit, or character, despite these pressures. Different types of existentialist philosophers see this process in different ways.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Johnny_Hodges_edit.jpg/150px-Johnny_Hodges_edit.jpg
