1.10	Insurgency_in_Laos	Insurgency in Laos	The insurgency in Laos refers to the ongoing, albeit sporadic, military conflict between the Lao People's Army and primarily members of the former "Secret Army" or the Hmong people, who have faced governmental reprisals due to Hmong support for the American-led, anti-communist campaigns in Laos during the Laotian Civil War. While severely depleted, the reminiscence of an early 1980s-era Royalist insurgency has been kept alive by an occasionally active guerilla force of around one thousand or so successors to that force. A right-wing insurgency with foreign support has appeared to have concluded by no later than 1990, and thus the Hmong insurgency remains by far the most active of the historical post-1975 trio of insurgencies.
