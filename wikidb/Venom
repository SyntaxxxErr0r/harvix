54.3	Venom	Venom	Venom is the general term referring to any variety of toxins used by certain types of animals that inject it into their victims by the means of a bite, sting or other sharp body feature. Unlike poison, which is ingested or inhaled into the victim's tract, administration of venom is usually directed into the lymphatic system itself for faster action.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Waspstinger1658-2.jpg/200px-Waspstinger1658-2.jpg
