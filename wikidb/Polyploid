27.04	Polyploid	Polyploid	Polyploid is a term used to describe cells and organisms containing more than two paired sets of chromosomes. Most eukaryotic species are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes â€” one set inherited from each parent. However polyploidy is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants. In addition, polyploidy also occurs in some tissues of animals who are otherwise diploid, such as human muscle tissues. This is known as endopolyploidy. (Monoploid organisms also occur; a monoploid has only one set of chromosomes. These include the vast majority of prokaryotes.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Haploid%2C_diploid_%2Ctriploid_and_tetraploid.svg/220px-Haploid%2C_diploid_%2Ctriploid_and_tetraploid.svg.png
