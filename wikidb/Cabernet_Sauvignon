84.8	Cabernet_Sauvignon	Cabernet Sauvignon	Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Napa Valley, Australia's Coonawarra region and Chile's Maipo Valley. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Red_Mountain_Cabernet_Sauvignon_grapes_from_Hedge_Vineyards.jpg/215px-Red_Mountain_Cabernet_Sauvignon_grapes_from_Hedge_Vineyards.jpg
