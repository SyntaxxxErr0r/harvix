1.00	Line_G_class	V/Line G class	The V/Line G class are a mainline diesel electric locomotives built by Clyde Engineering from 1984, the last of 33 locomotives entering service in December 1989. They were the last locomotives order by a government rail operator in Victoria, Australia and were the newest and most powerful locomotives in the Victorian broad gauge freight fleet until the XR class entered service, and can be considered a more technically advanced version of the C class. The class can be grouped into 4 subgroups, locos in the initial subgroup derived from the BL class locomotives, with later subgroups having minor detail changes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Pacific-national-g-classes.jpg/300px-Pacific-national-g-classes.jpg
