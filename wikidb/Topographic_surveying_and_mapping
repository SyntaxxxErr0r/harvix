2.00	Topographic_surveying_and_mapping	Topographic map	A topographic map is a type of map characterized by large-scale detail and quantitative representation of relief, usually using contour lines in modern mapping, but historically using a variety of methods. Traditional definitions require a topographic map to show both natural and man-made features. A topographic map is typically published as a map series, made up of two or more map sheets that combine to form the whole map. A contour line is a combination of two line segments that connect but do not intersect; these represent elevation on a topographic map.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Topographic_map_example.png/300px-Topographic_map_example.png
