2.20	Mexican_period_of_Arizona	Mexican period of Arizona	In 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain after a decade of war. The revolution had destroyed the colonial silver mining industry and had bankrupted the national treasury. Along the northern frontier, funds that had supported missions, presidios and trading routes were reduced. As missions began to wither without military protection, Mexico began auctioning off more land (land grants). The revolution also impacted the relationship between the Europeans, Pueblos and non-pueblo natives such as the Apache and Navajo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Flag_of_Arizona.svg/111px-Flag_of_Arizona.svg.png
