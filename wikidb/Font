73.0	Font	Font	In typography, a font is traditionally defined as a quantity of sorts composing a complete character set of a single size and style of a particular typeface. For example, the complete set of all the characters for "9-point Bulmer" is called a font, and the "10-point Bulmer" would be another separate font, but part of the same font family, whereas "9-point Bulmer boldface" would be another font in a different font family of the same typeface. One individual font character might be referred to as a "piece of font" or a "piece of type".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Helvetica_Neue_typeface_weights.svg/220px-Helvetica_Neue_typeface_weights.svg.png
