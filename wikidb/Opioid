55.0	Opioid	Opioid	An opioid is a psychoactive chemical that works by binding to opioid receptors, which are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The receptors in these organ systems mediate both the beneficial effects and the side effects of opioids.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Adrenorphin.png/125px-Adrenorphin.png
