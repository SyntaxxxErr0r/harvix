189.8	Currency	Currency	In economics, currency refers to a generally accepted medium of exchange. These are usually the coins and banknotes of a particular government, which comprise the physical aspects of a nation's money supply. The other part of a nation's money supply consists of bank deposits (sometimes called deposit money), ownership of which can be transferred by means of cheques, debit cards, or other forms of money transfer. Deposit money and currency are money in the sense that both are acceptable as a means of payment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Euromoenterogsedler.jpg/220px-Euromoenterogsedler.jpg
