66.4	Kayfabe	Kayfabe	The origin of the term is uncertain. Professional wrestling can trace some of its stylistic origins back to carnivals and catch wrestling, in a world which was far less "connected" than the present. With money tight, a carny would call home collect, telling the operator their name was "Kay Fabian" . This was a code for letting the people at home know that they had made it safely to the next town. The family would then deny the call. A carny could therefore communicate without paying for the cost of a phone call or telegram.
