1.00	Annie_Millwood	Jack the Ripper	"Jack the Ripper" is the best-known name given to an unidentified serial killer who was active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. The name originated in a letter, written by someone claiming to be the murderer, that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax, and may have been written by a journalist in a deliberate attempt to heighten interest in the story. Other nicknames used for the killer at the time were "The Whitechapel Murderer" and "Leather Apron".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/JacktheRipper1888.jpg/220px-JacktheRipper1888.jpg
