21.01	Guilloch%C3%A9	Guilloché	Guilloché is a decorative engraving technique in which a very precise intricate repetitive pattern or design is mechanically engraved into an underlying material with fine detail. Specifically, it involves a technique of engine turning, called guilloché in French after the French engineer “Guillot”, who invented a machine “that could scratch fine patterns and designs on metallic surfaces”. The machine called a rose engine,improved upon the more time-consuming practice of making similar designs by hand, allowing for greater delicacy, precision, and closeness of the line, as well as greater speed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Guilloche_without_Enamel.jpg/180px-Guilloche_without_Enamel.jpg
