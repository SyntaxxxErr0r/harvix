74.4	Comics	Comics	A comic, (from the Greek , kōmikos "of or pertaining to comedy" from κῶμος - kōmos "revel, komos", via the Latin cōmicus), denotes a hybrid medium having verbal side of its vocabulary tightly tied to its visual side in order to convey narrative or information only, the latter in case of non-fiction comics, seeking synergy by using both visual and verbal side in interaction. Although some comics are picture-only, pantomime strips, such as The Little King, the verbal side usually expand upon the pictures, but sometimes act in counterpoint.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/YellowKid.jpeg/200px-YellowKid.jpeg
