248.7	Man-in-the-middle_attack	Man-in-the-middle attack	The man-in-the-middle attack (often abbreviated MITM, also known as a bucket brigade attack, or sometimes Janus attack ) in cryptography and computer security is a form of active eavesdropping in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them, making them believe that they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all messages going between the two victims and inject new ones, which is straightforward in many circumstances (for example, an attacker within reception range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi wireless access point, can insert himself as a man-in-the-middle).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Man_in_the_middle_attack.svg/200px-Man_in_the_middle_attack.svg.png
