7.41	Sunni-Shia_relations	Shi'a–Sunni relations	Sunni and Shia Islam are the two major denominations of Islam. The demographic breakdown between the two denominations is difficult to assess and varies by source, but a good approximation is that 80–90% of the world's Muslims are Sunni and 5–20% are Shia, with most Shias belonging to the Twelver tradition and the rest divided between several other groups.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Allah-eser-green.png/180px-Allah-eser-green.png
