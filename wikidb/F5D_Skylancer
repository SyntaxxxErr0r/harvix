1.20	F5D_Skylancer	Douglas F5D Skylancer	The United States Douglas F5D Skylancer was a development of the F4D Skyray jet fighter for the United States Navy. Starting out as the F4D-2N, an all-weather version of the Skyray, the design was soon modified to take full advantage of the extra thrust of the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 eventually fitted to the Skyray instead of the Westinghouse J40 originally planned.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/F5D_Skylancer.jpg/300px-F5D_Skylancer.jpg
