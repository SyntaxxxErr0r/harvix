Although Pepys had no maritime experience, he rose by patronage, hard work and his talent for administration, to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and subsequently King James II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Samuel_Pepys.jpg/200px-Samuel_Pepys.jpg
