83.8	Bucharest	Bucharest	Bucharest was first mentioned in documents as early as 1459. Since then it has gone through a variety of changes, becoming the state capital of Romania in 1862 and steadily consolidating its position as the centre of the Romanian mass media, culture and arts. Its eclectic architecture is a mix of historical , interbellum (Bauhaus and Art Deco), Communist-era and modern. In the period between the two World Wars, the city's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of "Little Paris" (Micul Paris). Although many buildings and districts in the historic centre were damaged or destroyed by war, earthquakes, and Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's program of systematization, many survived. In recent years, the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Bucharest_montage_2.jpg/250px-Bucharest_montage_2.jpg
