73.7	Aerobic_exercise	Aerobic exercise	Aerobic exercise is physical exercise of relatively low intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process. Aerobic literally means "living in air", and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. Generally, light-to-moderate intensity activities that are sufficiently supported by aerobic metabolism can be performed for extended periods of time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Exercise_zones.png/300px-Exercise_zones.png
