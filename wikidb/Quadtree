55.1	Quadtree	Quadtree	A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Quadtrees are most often used to partition a two dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. The regions may be square or rectangular, or may have arbitrary shapes. This data structure was named a quadtree by Raphael Finkel and J.L. Bentley in 1974. A similar partitioning is also known as a Q-tree. All forms of Quadtrees share some common features:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Point_quadtree.svg/300px-Point_quadtree.svg.png
