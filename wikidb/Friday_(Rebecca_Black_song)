It was released as a single on March 14, 2011, by Ark Music Factory as Black's debut single. The music video for the song caught a sudden surge of hits after Michael J. Nelson, a comedian with a Twitter following, called it "the worst video ever made". When the video was removed from YouTube on June 16, 2011, it had already had amassed more than 167 million views, and had over 3.1 million "dislikes" (87% of total ratings) from YouTube users. The video was uploaded to YouTube again on September 16, 2011. Since the growth in popularity of the song and video, there have been numerous parody videos and remixes. Forbes stated that the notoriety of the song is another sign of the power of social media—specifically Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr, in this instance—in the ability to create "overnight sensations."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/Rebecca_Black_-_Friday.png/220px-Rebecca_Black_-_Friday.png
