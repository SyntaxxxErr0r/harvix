4.40	Darren_Ford_(baseball)	Darren Ford (baseball)	Darren Scott Ford (born October 1, 1985 in Vineland, New Jersey), nicknamed The Bullet, is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball. His nickname ("The Bullet") is derived from his world class foot speed, although it has not translated into a high percentage of stolen bases as he has been caught stealing or picked off quite a bit during his callups to the Parent club.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Darren_Ford_baseball.jpg/200px-Darren_Ford_baseball.jpg
