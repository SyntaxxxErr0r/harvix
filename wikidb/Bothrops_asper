20.63	Bothrops_asper	Bothrops asper	Bothrops species can be distinguished by their broad, flattened heads which are set apart from the rest of their bodies. To prevent water loss where they occur in drier regions, this species has more scales. Across its geographic range, this species varies greatly phenotypically. As a result, great confusion between it and other related species, most notably Bothrops atrox, which is similar in color but usually has yellow or rust-like tones and rectangular or trapezoidal blotches. The head of this snake is light to dark brown or even black. Although usually absent, it may have occipital botches or streaks that range from indistinct to distinct. The underside is most often pale yellow. Specimens of this species may weigh up to 6 kilograms (13 lb) and are often 1.2 to 1.8 meters (3.9 to 5.9 ft) in length. Very big females can reach lengths up to 2.5 metres (8.2 ft), although this is uncommon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Bothrops_asper_%28Panama%29_head.jpg/220px-Bothrops_asper_%28Panama%29_head.jpg
