A prisoner of war is generally a soldier, sailor, or airman who is imprisoned by an enemy power during or immediately after an armed conflict. Some non-combatant enemy personnel, such as merchant mariners and civil aircrews, were also considered prisoners of war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Chinese_and_North_Korean_POWs_at_camp_in_Pusan_HD-SN-99-03155.JPEG/200px-Chinese_and_North_Korean_POWs_at_camp_in_Pusan_HD-SN-99-03155.JPEG
