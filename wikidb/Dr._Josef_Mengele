4.10	Dr._Josef_Mengele	Josef Mengele	Josef Rudolf Mengele (German pronunciation: , March 16, 1911 â€“ February 7, 1979), also known as the Angel of Death (German: ) was a German SS officer and a physician in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. He earned doctorates in anthropology from Munich University and in medicine from Frankfurt University. He initially gained notoriety for being one of the SS physicians who supervised the selection of arriving transports of prisoners, determining who was to be killed and who was to become a forced laborer, but is far more infamous for performing human experiments on camp inmates, including children, for which Mengele was called the "Angel of Death". Mengele wrote, "I personally have not killed, injured or caused bodily harm to anyone."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Josef_Mengele.jpg
