7.12	Deir_Yassin_Massacre	Deir Yassin massacre	The Deir Yassin massacre took place on April 9, 1948, when around 120 fighters from the Irgun Zevai Leumi and Lohamei Herut Israel Zionist paramilitary groups attacked Deir Yassin near Jerusalem, a Palestinian-Arab village of roughly 600 people. The assault occurred as Jewish militia sought to relieve the blockade of Jerusalem during the civil war that preceded the end of British rule in Palestine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Kfar_Shaul_cropped%281%29.jpg/270px-Kfar_Shaul_cropped%281%29.jpg
