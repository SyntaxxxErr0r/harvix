12.20	Bosnian_crisis	Bosnian crisis	The Bosnian Crisis of 1908â€“1909, also known as the Annexation crisis, or the First Balkan Crisis, erupted into public view when on 6 October 1908, Austria-Hungary announced the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Russia, the Ottoman Empire, Britain, Italy, Serbia, Montenegro, Germany and France took an interest in these events. In April 1909 the Treaty of Berlin was amended to accept the new status quo bringing the crisis to an end. The crisis permanently damaged relations between Austria-Hungary on the one hand and Russia and the Kingdom of Serbia on the other. The annexation and reactions to the annexation were contributing causes of World War I.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Bosnian_Crisis_1908.jpg/220px-Bosnian_Crisis_1908.jpg
