1.02	Ravenna_Kibbutz	Ravenna Kibbutz	The Ravenna Kibbutz is a nondenominational Jewish intentional community located in the Ravenna neighborhood of Seattle. Its three rented houses and one apartment are home to 15 resident-organizers, who plan public programs such as Shabbat dinners and Jewish movie nights. In-house events are always free, though occasionally a donation jar is made available for those who wish to contribute. The Kibbutz's ideology isn't communistic; it's not a true commune but simply an example of cohousing. The Pacific Northwest contains many cohousing communities and a wide variety of Jewish organizations, but thus far the region has no other Jewish cohousing community.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8e/KibbutzDinnerGuestsClassic.jpg/220px-KibbutzDinnerGuestsClassic.jpg
