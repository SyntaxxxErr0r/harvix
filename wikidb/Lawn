59.9	Lawn	Lawn	A lawn is an area of aesthetic and recreational land planted with grasses or other durable plants, which usually are maintained at a low and consistent height. Low ornamental meadows in natural landscaping styles are a contemporary option of a lawn. In recreational contexts, the specialised names turf, pitch, field or green may be used, depending on the sport and the continent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Seededfertilizedlawn.JPG/220px-Seededfertilizedlawn.JPG
