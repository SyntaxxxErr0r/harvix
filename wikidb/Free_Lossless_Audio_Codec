94.9	Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec	FLAC	FLAC is a codec (compressor-decompressor) which allows digital audio to be losslessly compressed such that file size is reduced without any information being lost. Digital audio compressed by FLAC's algorithm can typically be reduced to 50â€“60% of its original size, and decompressed into an identical copy of the original audio data.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Flac_logo_vector.svg/262px-Flac_logo_vector.svg.png
