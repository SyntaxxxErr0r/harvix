56.4	John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy	Wikipedia biography controversy	The Wikipedia biography controversy, sometimes called the Seigenthaler incident, was a series of events that began in May 2005 with the anonymous posting of a hoax article in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia about John Seigenthaler, a well-known American journalist. The article falsely stated that Seigenthaler had been a suspect in the assassinations of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The 78-year-old Seigenthaler, who had been a friend and aide to Robert Kennedy, characterized the Wikipedia entry about him as "Internet character assassination".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._speaking.jpg/220px-John_Seigenthaler_Sr._speaking.jpg
