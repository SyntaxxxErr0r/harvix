73.5	Ganges	Ganges	The Ganges is the most sacred river to Hindus and is also a lifeline to millions of Indians who live along its course and depend on it for their daily needs. It is worshiped as the goddess Ganga in Hinduism. It has also been important historically: many former provincial or imperial capitals (such as Patliputra, Kannauj, Kara, Kashi, Allahabad, Murshidabad, Munger, Baharampur and Kolkata) have been located on its banks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Varanasiganga.jpg/250px-Varanasiganga.jpg
