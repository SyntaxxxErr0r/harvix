53.5	Battle_of_New_Orleans	Battle of New Orleans	The Battle of New Orleans took place on January 8, 1815 and was the final major battle of the War of 1812. American forces, commanded by Major General Andrew Jackson, defeated an invading British Army intent on seizing New Orleans and the vast territory the United States had acquired with the Louisiana Purchase. The Treaty of Ghent had been signed on December 24, 1814 and was ratified by the United States Senate on February 16, 1815. Hostilities continued until late February when official dispatches announcing the peace reached the combatants in Louisiana, finally putting an end to the war. The battle is widely regarded as the greatest American land victory of the war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/The_Battle_of_New_Orleans._January_1815._Copy_of_engraving_by_H._B._Hall_after_W._Momberger.%2C_ca._1900_-_1982_-_NARA_-_531091.tif/lossy-page1-300px-The_Battle_of_New_Orleans._January_1815._Copy_of_engraving_by_H._B._Hall_after_W._Momberger.%2C_ca._1900_-_1982_-_NARA_-_531091.tif.jpg
