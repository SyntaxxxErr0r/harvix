78.1	Nazi_Party	Nazi Party	The National Socialist German Workers' Party , abbreviated NSDAP), commonly known in English in short form as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany between 1920 and 1945. Its predecessor, the German Workers' Party (DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. The term Nazi is German and stems from Nationalsozialist, due to the pronunciation of Latin -tion- as -tsion- in German (rather than -shon- as it is in English), with German Z being pronounced as 'ts' as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/NSDAP-Logo.svg/150px-NSDAP-Logo.svg.png
