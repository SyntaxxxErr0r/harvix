In 1885, Louis Riel had been a leader of a resistance movement by the MÃ©tis and First Nations people of western Canada against the Canadian government in what is now the modern province of Saskatchewan. Known as the North-West Rebellion, this resistance was suppressed by the Canadian military, which led to Riel's surrender and trial for treason. The trial, which took place in July 1885 and lasted only five days, resulted in a guilty verdict. He was also given a choice to plead guilty or insanity. Riel was subsequently executed by hanging, an outcome which has had a lasting impact on relations between the Francophone and Anglophone Canadians.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/RielAtTrial.jpg/300px-RielAtTrial.jpg
