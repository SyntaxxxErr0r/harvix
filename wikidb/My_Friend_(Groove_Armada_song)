2.00	My_Friend_(Groove_Armada_song)	My Friend (Groove Armada song)	"My Friend" is a song by English electronica duo Groove Armada, released as the second single released from their third studio album, Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub) (2001). The song features vocals by Celetia Martin and contains a sample from "Gotta Learn How to Dance" by Fatback Band and samples a drum break from Skull Snaps' "It's a New Day". The lyrics are an interpolation from Brandy's 1995 hit "Best Friend". The song was featured in a Dutch television commercial for Royal Club soft drinks in 2002, which resulted in a re-release of the single in the Netherlands and a higher charting in the Dutch singles charts than the year before.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/1_groove_arm_my_friend.jpg/220px-1_groove_arm_my_friend.jpg
