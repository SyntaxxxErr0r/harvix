52.0	Containerization	Containerization	Containerization or containerisation (see spelling differences) is a system of freight transport based on a range of steel intermodal containers (also "shipping containers", "ISO containers" etc.). Containers are built to standardised dimensions, and can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The system, developed after World War II, led to greatly reduced transport costs, and supported a vast increase in international trade.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Line3174_-_Shipping_Containers_at_the_terminal_at_Port_Elizabeth%2C_New_Jersey_-_NOAA.jpg/220px-Line3174_-_Shipping_Containers_at_the_terminal_at_Port_Elizabeth%2C_New_Jersey_-_NOAA.jpg
