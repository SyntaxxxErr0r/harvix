2.10	Overlap-add_method	Overlap–add method	Fig. 1 sketches the idea of the overlap–add method. The signal is first partitioned into non-overlapping sequences, then the discrete Fourier transforms of the sequences are evaluated by multiplying the FFT of with the FFT of . After recovering of by inverse FFT, the resulting output signal is reconstructed by overlapping and adding the as shown in the figure. The overlap arises from the fact that a linear convolution is always longer than the original sequences. In the early days of development of the fast Fourier transform, was often chosen to be a power of 2 for efficiency, but further development has revealed efficient transforms for larger prime factorizations of L, reducing computational sensitivity to this parameter. A pseudocode of the algorithm is the following:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Depiction_of_overlap-add_algorithm.png
