77.1	The_long_tail	Long Tail	The Long Tail or long tail refers to the statistical property that a larger share of population rests within the tail of a probability distribution than observed under a "normal" or Gaussian distribution. A long tail distortion will arise with the inclusion of some unusually high (or low) values which increase (decrease) the mean, skewing the distribution to the right (or left).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Long_tail.svg/220px-Long_tail.svg.png
