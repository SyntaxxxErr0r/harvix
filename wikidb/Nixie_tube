The glass tube contains a wire-mesh anode and multiple cathodes, shaped like numerals or other symbols. Applying power to one cathode surrounds it with an orange glow discharge. The tube is filled with a gas at low pressure, usually mostly neon and often a little mercury or argon, in a Penning mixture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Nixie2.gif/170px-Nixie2.gif
