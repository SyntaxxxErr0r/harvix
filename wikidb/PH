133.3	PH	pH	In chemistry, pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 °C (77 °F). Solutions with a pH less than 7 are said to be acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic or alkaline. pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineering and many other applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/PH_Scale.svg/220px-PH_Scale.svg.png
