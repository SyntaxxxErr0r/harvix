2.00	Mercedes-Benz_W100	Mercedes-Benz 600	The Mercedes-Benz 600 is a large luxury automobile offered in several variants worldwide. Introduced in September 1963, it had very few competitors, these being Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Cadillac Fleetwood 75, the stretched Lehmann-Peterson Lincoln, and the Chrysler Imperial Crown Ghia. Generally, the long-wheel-base (LWB) 600 was intended as chauffeur-driven; many featured a central divider incorporating a powered window between front and rear compartments. Short-wheel-base (SWB) 600 models were designed to be owner-driven.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Mercedes-Benz_600_vl_silver_TCE.jpg/250px-Mercedes-Benz_600_vl_silver_TCE.jpg
