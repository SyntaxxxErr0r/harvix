1.00	Burnham_Pavilions	Burnham Pavilions	The Burnham Pavilions were public sculptures by Zaha Hadid and Ben van Berkel in Millennium Park, which were located in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. Both pavilions were located in the Chase Promenade South. Their purpose was to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Daniel Burnhamâ€™s Plan of Chicago, and symbolize the city's continued pursuit of the Plan's architectural vision with contemporary architecture and planning. The sculptures were privately-funded and reside in Millennium Park. The pavilions were designed to be temporary structures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/20090807_Hadid_Pavilion_at_night.jpg/220px-20090807_Hadid_Pavilion_at_night.jpg
