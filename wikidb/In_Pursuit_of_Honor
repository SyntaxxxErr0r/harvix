2.21	In_Pursuit_of_Honor	In Pursuit of Honor	In Pursuit of Honor is a 1995 made-for-cable movie directed by Ken Olin. Don Johnson stars as a member of a United States Cavalry detachment refusing to slaughter its horses after being ordered to do so by General Douglas MacArthur. The movie follows the plight of the officers as they attempt to save the animals that the Army no longer needs as it modernizes toward a mechanized military. The movie claims to be based on a true story, but legend is all that exists to prove this event occurred.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/In_pursuit_of_honor.jpg
