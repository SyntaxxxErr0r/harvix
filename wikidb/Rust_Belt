69.9	Rust_Belt	Rust Belt	The Rust Belt is a term that gained currency in the 1980s as the informal description of an area straddling the Midwestern and Northeastern United States, it specialized in large-scale manufacturing of consumer and industrial products. This includes the transportation and processing of the raw materials required for such manufacturing. After several "boom" periods from the late-19th to the mid-20th century, cities in this area struggled to adapt to a variety of adverse economic conditions later in the 20th century, such as the movement of manufacturing facilities to the southeastern states with their lower labor costs, the rise of automation in industrial processes, a decreased need for labor in making steel products, and the deregulation of foreign trade policies. Places that struggled the most with these conditions soon encountered several difficulties in common, including population loss, depletion of local tax revenues, and chronic high unemployment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Total_mfctrg_jobs_change_54-02.png/400px-Total_mfctrg_jobs_change_54-02.png
