99.0	Standard_RAID_levels	Standard RAID levels	The standard RAID levels are a basic set of RAID configurations and employ striping, mirroring, or parity. The standard RAID levels can be modified for other benefits . Other, non-standard RAID levels and non-RAID drive architectures provide alternatives to RAID architectures. RAID levels and their associated data formats are standardised by SNIA in the Common RAID Disk Drive Format (DDF) standard.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/RAID_0.svg/150px-RAID_0.svg.png
