71.0	Remote_sensing	Remote sensing	Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon, without making physical contact with the object. In modern usage, the term generally refers to the use of aerial sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth (both on the surface, and in the atmosphere and oceans) by means of propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation emitted from aircraft or satellites).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Death-valley-sar.jpg/170px-Death-valley-sar.jpg
