1.30	Far_right_in_Croatia	Far right in Croatia	Far right in Croatia refers to any manifestation of far-right politics in the Republic of Croatia. Individuals and groups in Croatia that employ far-right politics are most often associated with the historical Ustaše movement, hence they have connections to Neo-Nazism and neo-fascism. That World War II political movement was an extremist organization at the time supported by the German Nazis and the Italian Fascists. The association with the Ustaše has been called "Neo-Ustashism" by Slavko Goldstein.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Croatia_graffiti.JPG/250px-Croatia_graffiti.JPG
