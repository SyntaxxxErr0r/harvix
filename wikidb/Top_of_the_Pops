It was traditionally shown every Thursday evening on BBC One, before being moved to Fridays in 1996, and then moved to Sundays on BBC Two in 2005. Each weekly programme consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, every year there was a special edition of the programme on Christmas Day featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7d/Top_of_the_Pops_2003.jpg/250px-Top_of_the_Pops_2003.jpg
