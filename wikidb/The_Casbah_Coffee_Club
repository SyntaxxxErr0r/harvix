7.10	The_Casbah_Coffee_Club	The Casbah Coffee Club	The Casbah Coffee Club was a rock and roll music venue in West Derby, Liverpool, started by Mona Best in 1959 in the cellar of the family home. The Casbah, as it became widely known, was planned as a members-only club for Best's sons Pete, his younger brother, Rory, and their friends. Mona came up with the idea of the club after watching a TV report about The 2i's Coffee Bar in London's Soho where several singers had been discovered. She decided to open the club, which was located in her cellar, on 29 August 1959, for her sons, their friends and young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/40/McCartney_and_Lennon_at_The_Casbah_Club.jpg/200px-McCartney_and_Lennon_at_The_Casbah_Club.jpg
