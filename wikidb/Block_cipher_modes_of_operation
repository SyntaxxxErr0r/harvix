132.5	Block_cipher_modes_of_operation	Block cipher modes of operation	In cryptography, modes of operation is the procedure of enabling the repeated and secure use of a block cipher under a single key. A block cipher by itself allows encryption only of a single data block of the cipher's block length. When targeting a variable-length message, the data must first be partitioned into separate cipher blocks. Typically, the last block must also be extended to match the cipher's block length using a suitable padding scheme. A mode of operation describes the process of encrypting each of these blocks, and generally uses randomization based on an additional input value, often called an initialization vector, to allow doing so safely.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Ecb_encryption.png
