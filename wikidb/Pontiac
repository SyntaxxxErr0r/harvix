70.7	Pontiac	Pontiac	Pontiac was an automobile brand that was established in 1926 as a companion make for General Motors' Oakland. Quickly overtaking its parent in popularity, it supplanted the Oakland brand entirely by 1933 and, for most of its life, became a companion make for Chevrolet. Pontiac was sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico by General Motors (GM). Pontiac was marketed as the performance division of General Motors for many years, specializing in mainstream performance vehicles. Pontiac was relatively more popular in Canada, where for much of its history, it was marketed as a low-priced vehicle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/Pontiac_Logo.png/175px-Pontiac_Logo.png
