93.1	Bernoulli's_principle	Bernoulli's principle	In fluid dynamics, Bernoulli's principle states that for an inviscid flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. Bernoulli's principle is named after the Dutch-Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli who published his principle in his book Hydrodynamica in 1738.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/VenturiFlow.png
