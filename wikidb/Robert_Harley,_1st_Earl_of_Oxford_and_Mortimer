12.01	Robert_Harley,_1st_Earl_of_Oxford_and_Mortimer	Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer	Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer KG (5 December 1661 â€“ 21 May 1724) was a British politician and statesman of the late Stuart and early Georgian periods. He began his career as a Whig, before defecting to a new Tory Ministry. Between 1711 and 1714 he served as First Lord of the Treasury, effectively Queen Anne's chief minister. He has been called a Prime Minister, though it is generally accepted that the position was first held by Sir Robert Walpole in 1721.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/RobertHarleyInColour.jpg/250px-RobertHarleyInColour.jpg
