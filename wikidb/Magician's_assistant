6.20	Magician's_assistant	Magician's assistant	A magician's assistant is a performer in a magic act who is not billed as the magician or principal name in the act. The role of an assistant can include holding the props that are used by a magician, shifting props onto and off the stage, and serving as a living prop in illusions that involve manipulation of the human body. Other aspects of the role can include dancing or acting as visual ornamentation, sometimes for simple aesthetic purposes and sometimes to misdirect audience attention. The figure of the glamorous female assistant has become a stereotype or icon in art, popular media and fiction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/FarlaAssistents.JPG/250px-FarlaAssistents.JPG
