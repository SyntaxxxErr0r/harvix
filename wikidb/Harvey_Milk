148.0	Harvey_Milk	Harvey Milk	Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 â€“ November 27, 1978) was an American politician who became the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California when he won a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Politics and gay activism were not his early interests; he was not open about his homosexuality and did not participate in civic matters until around the age of 40, after his experiences in the counterculture of the 1960s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Harvey_Milk_in_1978_at_Mayor_Moscone%27s_Desk_crop.jpg/220px-Harvey_Milk_in_1978_at_Mayor_Moscone%27s_Desk_crop.jpg
