55.8	Chanterelle	Chanterelle	Cantharellus cibarius, commonly known as the chanterelle, golden chanterelle or girolle, is a fungus. It is probably the best known species of the genus Cantharellus, if not the entire family of Cantharellaceae. It is orange or yellow, meaty and funnel-shaped. On the lower surface, underneath the smooth cap, it has gill-like ridges that run almost all the way down its stipe, which tapers down seamlessly from the cap. It has a fruity smell, reminiscent of apricots and a mildly peppery taste (hence its German name, Pfifferling) and is considered an excellent edible mushroom.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Chanterelle_Cantharellus_cibarius.jpg/235px-Chanterelle_Cantharellus_cibarius.jpg
