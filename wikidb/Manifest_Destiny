114.7	Manifest_Destiny	Manifest destiny	Manifest Destiny was the 19th century American belief that the United States (often in the ethnically specific form of the "Anglo-Saxon race") was destined to expand across the continent. It was used by Democrats in the 1840s to justify the war with Mexico; the concept was denounced by Whigs, and fell into disuse after the mid-19th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/American_progress.JPG/300px-American_progress.JPG
