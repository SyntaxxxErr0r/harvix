3.00	MOBSCENE	Mobscene	"Mobscene", stylized as "mOBSCENE", is the inaugural single taken from the 2003 Marilyn Manson album The Golden Age of Grotesque. Lines in the song chanted by female vocalists, "Be obscene, be, be obscene..." are inspired by a quote by Oscar Wilde that has been commonly used as a chant among cheerleaders. Many critics have also compared lines in this song to the TV gameshow in the 2000 film, Requiem for a Dream, starring Jared Leto . The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, but lost out to Metallica's, "St. Anger."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/Marilyn_manson_mobscene.png
