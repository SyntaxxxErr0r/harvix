1.00	Signature_class	Vista class cruise ship	The Vista class is a class of Panamax-type cruise ships, built by Fincantieri Marghera shipyard, in Italy. Vista class cruise ships are operated by Holland America Line, P&amp;O Cruises, Cunard Line and Costa Cruises. The ships are equipped with a diesel-electric power plant and an Azipod propulsion system. The ships are designed so that eighty-five percent of the staterooms have ocean views and sixty-seven percent have verandas; the extensive use of glass in the superstructure of Vista class ships is also reflected in the class name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Noordam.jpg/300px-Noordam.jpg
