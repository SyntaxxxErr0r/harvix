67.5	Van_de_Graaff_generator	Van de Graaff generator	A Van de Graaff generator is an electrostatic generator which uses a moving belt to accumulate very high voltages on a hollow metal globe on the top of the stand. It was invented in 1929 by American physicist Robert J. Van de Graaff. The potential differences achieved in modern Van de Graaff generators can reach 5 megavolts. The Van de Graaff generator can be thought of as a constant-current source connected in parallel with a capacitor and a very large electrical resistance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Van_de_graaff_generator_sm.jpg/220px-Van_de_graaff_generator_sm.jpg
