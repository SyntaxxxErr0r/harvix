3.00	Green_Anaconda	Eunectes murinus	The Green Anaconda is one of the world's longest snakes, reaching more than 6.6 m (22 ft) long. Reports of anacondas 35â€“40 feet or even longer also exist, but such claims need to be regarded with caution as no specimens of such lengths have ever been deposited in a museum and hard evidence is lacking. There is a $50,000 cash reward for anyone that can catch an anaconda 30 ft (9.1 m) or longer, but the prize has not been claimed yet. Although the reticulated python is longer, the anaconda is the heaviest snake. The longest (and heaviest) scientifically recorded specimen was a female measuring 521 cm (17 ft 1 in) long and weighing 97.5 kilograms (215 lb).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Eunectes_murinus2.jpg/220px-Eunectes_murinus2.jpg
