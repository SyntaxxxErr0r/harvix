1.00	Photonic_metamaterial	Photonic metamaterial	Photonic metamaterials, also known as Optical metamaterials, are a type of electromagnetic metamaterial, which are designed to interact with optical frequencies which are terahertz , infrared (IR), and eventually, visible wavelengths. As a type of metamaterial, the periodic structures are made up of single units called cells. These single units are much smaller than the wavelength of the radiated source. With photonic metamaterials the radiated source is at optical wavelengths. Furthermore, the subwavelength period distinguishes the photonic metamaterial from photonic band gap or photonic crystal structures. This is because the special optical properties do not arise from photonic bandgaps, but rather from a subwavelength interaction with the light spectrum, which mimics atoms or ions. However, the periodic cells (meta-atoms) are fabricated on a scale that is magnitudes larger than the atom, yet smaller than the radiated wavelength.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg/220px-VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png
