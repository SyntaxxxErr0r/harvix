108.4	Gonzo_journalism	Gonzo journalism	Gonzo journalism is a style of journalism that is written without claims of objectivity, often including the reporter as part of the story via a first-person narrative. The word "gonzo" is believed to be first used in 1970 to describe an article by Hunter S. Thompson, who later popularized the style. The term has since been applied to other subjective artistic endeavors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Gonzo.svg/200px-Gonzo.svg.png
