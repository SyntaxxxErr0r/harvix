2.20	Atomic_emission_spectroscopy	Atomic emission spectroscopy	A sample of a material (analyte) is brought into the flame as a gas or sprayed solution. The heat from the flame evaporates the solvent and breaks chemical bonds to create free atoms. The thermal energy also excites the atoms into excited electronic states that subsequently emit light when they return to the ground electronic state. Each element emits light at a characteristic wavelength, which is dispersed by a grating or prism and detected in the spectrometer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Flame_photometry_calcium.jpg/250px-Flame_photometry_calcium.jpg
