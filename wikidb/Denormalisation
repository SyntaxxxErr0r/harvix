1.00	Denormalisation	Denormalization	In computing, denormalization is the process of attempting to optimise the read performance of a database by adding redundant data or by grouping data. In some cases, denormalisation helps cover up the inefficiencies inherent in relational database software. A relational normalised database imposes a heavy access load over physical storage of data even if it is well tuned for high performance.
