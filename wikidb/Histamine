51.7	Histamine	Histamine	Histamine is an organic nitrogen compound involved in local immune responses as well as regulating physiological function in the gut and acting as a neurotransmitter. Histamine triggers the inflammatory response. As part of an immune response to foreign pathogens, histamine is produced by basophils and by mast cells found in nearby connective tissues. Histamine increases the permeability of the capillaries to white blood cells and some proteins, to allow them to engage pathogens in the infected tissues.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Histamin_-_Histamine.svg/200px-Histamin_-_Histamine.svg.png
