83.5	Asana	Asana	Asana is a body position, typically associated with the practice of Yoga, originally identified as a mastery of sitting still, with the spine as a conduit of biodynamic union. In the context of Yoga practice, asana refers to two things: the place where a practitioner (or yogin, in general usage), yogi (male), or yogini (female) sits and the manner (posture) in which he/she sits. In the Yoga sutras, Patanjali suggests that asana is "to be seated in a position that is firm, but relaxed" for extended, or timeless periods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Tanum%C3%A2nas%C3%AE_en_Meditacion_Loto_Padmasana.JPG/220px-Tanum%C3%A2nas%C3%AE_en_Meditacion_Loto_Padmasana.JPG
