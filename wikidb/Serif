114.1	Serif	Serif	In typography, serifs are semi-structural details on the ends of some of the strokes that make up letters and symbols. A typeface with serifs is called a serif typeface (or serifed typeface). A typeface without serifs is called sans serif or sans-serif, from the French sans, meaning “without”. Some typography sources refer to sans-serif typefaces as "Grotesque" (in German "grotesk") or "Gothic", and serif typefaces as "Roman".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Serif_and_sans-serif_01.svg/212px-Serif_and_sans-serif_01.svg.png
