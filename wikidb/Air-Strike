1.00	Air-Strike	Airstrike	An air strike is an attack on a specific objective by military aircraft during an offensive mission. Air strikes are commonly delivered from aircraft such as fighters, bombers, ground attack aircraft, attack helicopters, and others. The official definition includes all sorts of targets, including enemy air targets, but in popular use the term is usually narrowed to tactical (small-scale) attack on a ground or naval objective. Weapons used in an airstrike can range from machine gun bullets, missiles, to various types of bombs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sremska_mitrovica_all_force.jpg/200px-Sremska_mitrovica_all_force.jpg
