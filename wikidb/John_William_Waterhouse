53.6	John_William_Waterhouse	John William Waterhouse	John William Waterhouse (baptised 6 April 1849; died 10 February 1917) was an English painter known for working in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked several decades after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which had seen its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century, leading him to have gained the moniker of "the modern Pre-Raphaelite". Borrowing stylistic influences not only from the earlier Pre-Raphaelites but also from his contemporaries, the Impressionists, his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/John_William_Waterhouse_001.jpg/180px-John_William_Waterhouse_001.jpg
