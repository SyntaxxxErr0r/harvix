2.00	Jarrah_(tree)	Eucalyptus marginata	Eucalyptus marginata is one of the most common species of Eucalyptus tree in the southwest of Western Australia. The tree and the wood are usually referred to by the Aboriginal name Jarrah. Because of the similar appearance of worked jarrah timber to the Honduras mahogany tree, jarrah was once called Swan River mahogany after the river system that runs through Perth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Jarrah_tree_burls_01_gnangarra.JPG/220px-Jarrah_tree_burls_01_gnangarra.JPG
