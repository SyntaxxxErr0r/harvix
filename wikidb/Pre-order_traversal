1.01	Pre-order_traversal	Tree traversal	In computer science, tree traversal refers to the process of visiting (examining and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once, in a systematic way. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited. The following algorithms are described for a binary tree, but they may be generalized to other trees as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Sorted_binary_tree.svg/350px-Sorted_binary_tree.svg.png
