64.1	International_law	International law	International law is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and nations. It differs from national legal systems in that it only concerns nations rather than private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to confirm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/Chile_signs_UN_Charter_1945.jpg/220px-Chile_signs_UN_Charter_1945.jpg
