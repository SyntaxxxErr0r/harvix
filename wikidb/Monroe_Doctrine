82.7	Monroe_Doctrine	Monroe Doctrine	The Monroe Doctrine is a policy of the United States introduced on December 2, 1823. It stated that further efforts by European nations to colonize land or interfere with states in North or South America would be viewed as acts of aggression requiring U.S. intervention. The Doctrine noted that the United States would neither interfere with existing European colonies nor meddle in the internal concerns of European countries. The Doctrine was issued at a time when nearly all Latin American colonies of Spain and Portugal had achieved independence from the Spanish Empire (except Peru and Bolivia, which became independent in 1823 and 1825 respectively, and Cuba and Puerto Rico). The United States, working in agreement with Britain, wanted to guarantee no European power would move in.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Jamesmonroe-npgallery.jpg/210px-Jamesmonroe-npgallery.jpg
