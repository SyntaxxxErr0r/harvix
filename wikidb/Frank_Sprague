4.00	Frank_Sprague	Frank J. Sprague	Frank Julian Sprague (July 25, 1857 in Milford, Connecticut - October 25, 1934) was an American naval officer and inventor who contributed to the development of the electric motor, electric railways, and electric elevators. His contributions were especially important in promoting urban development by increasing the size cities could reasonably attain (through better transportation) and by allowing greater concentration of business in commercial sections (through use of electric elevators in skyscrapers). He became known as the "Father of Electric Traction".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Frank_j._sprague.jpg
