15.24	Bandhavgarh_National_Park	Bandhavgarh National Park	The history of the region can be traced back to the 1st century. There are 39 caves in the Bandhavgarh fort and in the surrounding hillocks up to a radius of about 5 km. The oldest cave dates from the 1st century. Several caves carry inscriptions in Brahmi script. Some caves have embossed figures such as tigers, pigs, elephants and horsemen. Badi gufa, the largest cave, has a broad entrance, nine small rooms and several pillars. It has been dated back to the 10th century. The cave appears to be primitive, lacking the elaborate statues and carvings seen in the caves of the Buddhist period. Its purpose remains a mystery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Bandhavgarhfort.JPG/150px-Bandhavgarhfort.JPG
