1.00	Mini_Transat	Mini Transat 6.50	Mini Transat 6.50 also known as Transat 650 is a solo transatlantic yacht race that starts in France and ends in Brasil covering over 4000 miles with a stop in the Madeira or the Canary Islands. The yachts are very small considering the scope of the race, and are sanctioned by the Miniclasse 6.50 organization. Miniclasse 6.50 closely monitors the craft but applies only minimal design restrictions such as length (6.5m), beam (3.0m), draft (approximately 2.0m), and material specifications , making the mini transat 6.50 an open design.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Mini_transat_2007_sepia.JPG/300px-Mini_transat_2007_sepia.JPG
