2.10	HaAh_HaGadol_2	HaAh HaGadol 2	HaAh HaGadol 2 was the second series of the Israeli version of the reality show Big Brother. The show was first broadcast on 15 November 2009, and ended on 4 March 2010. Sixteen housemates entered the house on launch night and another five joining after 43 days. The housemates competed for a one million shekel prize. The house was located in Neve Ilan, a suburb of Jerusalem. The twist this season was that the house was split in half, the same concept used in Big Brother 9 UK, and the introduction of the Head of Household.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Big_brother_countries.PNG/150px-Big_brother_countries.PNG
