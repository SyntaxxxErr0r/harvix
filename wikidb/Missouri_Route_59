3.00	Missouri_Route_59	Missouri Route 59	Route 59 is a highway in southwest Missouri running from Interstate 44 at Fidelity to the Arkansas state line where it continues as Highway 59. It replaced a large section of U.S. Route 71 and Alternate US 71 in sections. The first section was between Lanagan and the Arkansas state line when US 71 was moved down the former Route 88. In the 1990s, US 71 was moved and upgraded to interstate standards from Neosho to Lanagan and Route 59 was extended north to Neosho. When US 71 was moved east of Joplin in the late 1990s, Alternate US 71 was deleted, and Route 59 was extended north to replace that highway. The highway was numbered after Arkansas Highway 59.
