65.5	Clarinet	Clarinet	The clarinet is a type of woodwind instrument. The name derives from adding the suffix -et (meaning little) to the Italian word clarino (meaning a type of trumpet designed for high-register playing), as the first clarinets had a strident tone similar to that of a trumpet. The instrument has an approximately cylindrical bore, and uses a single reed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Clarinet_range.svg/180px-Clarinet_range.svg.png
