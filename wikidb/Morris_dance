114.6	Morris_dance	Morris dance	Morris dance is a form of English folk dance usually accompanied by music. It is based on rhythmic stepping and the execution of choreographed figures by a group of dancers. Implements such as sticks, swords, handkerchiefs and bells may also be wielded by the dancers. In a small number of dances for one or two men, steps are performed near and across a pair of clay tobacco pipes laid across each other on the floor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/CotswoldMorrisHandkerchiefs20040501_CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg/220px-CotswoldMorrisHandkerchiefs20040501_CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg
