Historically the name refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on May 1, 1776. In more modern contexts the name refers to a purported conspiratorial organization which is alleged to mastermind events and control world affairs through governments and corporations to establish a New World Order. In this context the Illuminati are usually represented as a modern version or continuation of the Bavarian Illuminati.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Adam_Weishaupt01.jpg/220px-Adam_Weishaupt01.jpg
