94.7	Michael_Schumacher	Michael Schumacher	After beginning with karting, Schumacher won German drivers' championships in Formula König and Formula Three before joining Mercedes in the World Sportscar Championship. After one Mercedes-funded race for the Jordan Formula One team Schumacher signed as a driver for the Benetton Formula One team in 1991. After winning consecutive championships with Benetton in 1994/5, Schumacher moved to Ferrari in 1996 and won another five consecutive drivers' titles with them from 2000–2004. Schumacher retired from Formula One driving in 2006 staying with Ferrari as an advisor. Schumacher agreed to return for Ferrari part-way through 2009, as cover for the badly injured Felipe Massa, but was prevented by a neck injury. He later signed a three year contract to drive for the new Mercedes GP team starting in 2010.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Schumi_di_GP_Kanada_2011_cropped.jpg/220px-Schumi_di_GP_Kanada_2011_cropped.jpg
