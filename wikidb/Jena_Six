67.0	Jena_Six	Jena Six	The Jena Six were six black teenagers convicted in the beating of Justin Barker, a white student at Jena High School in Jena, Louisiana, on December 4, 2006. Barker was injured in the assault by the members of the Jena Six, and received treatment for his injuries at an emergency room. While the case was pending, it was often cited as an example of racial injustice in the United States, due to a belief that the defendants had initially been charged with too-serious offenses and had been treated unfairly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Baisden-and-Sharpton.jpg/300px-Baisden-and-Sharpton.jpg
