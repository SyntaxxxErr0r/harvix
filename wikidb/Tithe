73.1	Tithe	Tithe	A tithe (from Old English: teogo√æa "tenth") is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory tax to government. Today, tithes (or tithing) are normally voluntary and paid in cash, cheques, or stocks, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products (that grown of the land, or fruit of the tree). Several European countries operate a formal process linked to the tax system allowing some churches to assess tithes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Tithe_Pig_Group_of_Derby_Porcelain_c_1770.jpg/220px-Tithe_Pig_Group_of_Derby_Porcelain_c_1770.jpg
