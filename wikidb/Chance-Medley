1.00	Chance-Medley	Chance medley	Chance medley (from the Anglo-French chance-medlee, a mixed chance), is a term from English law used to describe a homicide arising from a sudden quarrel or fight. The term distinguishes a killing that lacks malice aforethought necessary for murder, on the one hand, and pure accident.
