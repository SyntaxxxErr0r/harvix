59.9	Triassic	Triassic	The Triassic is a geologic period and system that extends from about 250 to 200 Ma (million years ago). It is the first period of the Mesozoic Era, and lies between the Permian and Jurassic periods. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich Von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (tri meaning "three") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europe—red beds, capped by chalk, followed by black shales—called the 'Trias.'	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/LateTriassicGlobal.jpg/240px-LateTriassicGlobal.jpg
