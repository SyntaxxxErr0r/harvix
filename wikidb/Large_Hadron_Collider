392.9	Large_Hadron_Collider	Large Hadron Collider	The Large Hadron Collider is the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) from 1998 to 2008, with the aim of allowing physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics and high-energy physics, and particularly for the existence of the hypothesized Higgs boson and of the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetry. The LHC is expected to address some of the most fundamental questions of physics, advancing the understanding of the deepest laws of nature. It contains six detectors each designed for specific kinds of exploration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/LHC.svg/250px-LHC.svg.png
