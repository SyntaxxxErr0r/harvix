69.3	Minor_Threat	Minor Threat	Minor Threat was an American hardcore punk band, formed in Washington, D.C. in 1980 and disbanded in 1983. The band was relatively short-lived, but had a strong influence on the hardcore punk scene, both stylistically and in establishing a "do it yourself" (DIY) ethic for music distribution and concert promotion. Minor Threat's song "Straight Edge" became the eventual basis of the straight edge movement, while the band often professed their own "straight edge" ideals. Allmusic described Minor Threat's music as "iconic," and noted that their groundbreaking music "has held up better than most of their contemporaries."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Minor-threat-malcolm-riviera.jpg/220px-Minor-threat-malcolm-riviera.jpg
