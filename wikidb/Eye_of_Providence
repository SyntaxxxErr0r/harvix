63.7	Eye_of_Providence	Eye of Providence	The Eye of Providence (or the all-seeing eye of God) is a symbol showing an eye often surrounded by rays of light or a glory and usually enclosed by a triangle. It is sometimes interpreted as representing the eye of God watching over humankind (or divine providence). In the modern era, the most notable depiction of the eye is the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States, which appears on the United States one-dollar bill.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/ChristianEyeOfProvidence.png/200px-ChristianEyeOfProvidence.png
