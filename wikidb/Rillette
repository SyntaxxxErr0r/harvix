6.00	Rillette	Rillettes	Rillettes is a preparation of meat similar to pâté. Originally made with pork, the meat is cubed or chopped, salted heavily and cooked slowly in fat until it is tender enough to be easily shredded, and then cooled with enough of the fat to form a paste. They are normally used as spread on bread or toast and served at room temperature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Rillettes.jpg/220px-Rillettes.jpg
