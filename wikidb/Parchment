73.1	Parchment	Parchment	Parchment is a thin material made from calfskin, sheepskin or goatskin, often split. Its most common use was as a material for writing on, for documents, notes, or the pages of a book, codex or manuscript. It is distinct from leather in that parchment is limed but not tanned; therefore, it is very reactive to changes in relative humidity and is not waterproof. The finer qualities of parchment are called vellum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Parchment_from_goatskin.jpg/230px-Parchment_from_goatskin.jpg
