84.9	Cryonics	Cryonics	Cryonics (from Greek kryos- meaning icy cold) is the low-temperature preservation of humans and animals who can no longer be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future. Cryopreservation of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology. The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent information-theoretic definition of death. It is proposed that cryopreserved people might someday be recovered by using highly advanced future technology. To date there have been no successful revivals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Cryo_surgery.jpg/270px-Cryo_surgery.jpg
