60.4	Binding_of_Isaac	Binding of Isaac	The Binding of Isaac Akedah (עקדה) or (עקידת יצחק) Akeidat Yitzchak in Hebrew and Dhabih (ذبيح) in Arabic, is a story from the Hebrew Bible in which God asks Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac, on Mount Moriah. The account states that Abraham "bound Isaac his son" before placing him on the altar, thus the popular name for the incident.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/The_Sacrifice_of_Isaac_by_Caravaggio.jpg/250px-The_Sacrifice_of_Isaac_by_Caravaggio.jpg
