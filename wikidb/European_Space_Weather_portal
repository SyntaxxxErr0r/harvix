ESWeP is an integrated website providing a centralized access point to the space weather community to share their knowledge and results. The website is hosted and maintained at the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy. Its development will be continued in the framework of the COST ES0803 action (Developing space weather products and services in Europe). On the ESWeP, a large section is devoted to education and outreach. Children as young as five years old are invited to get involved in some of these activities. For example, artworks illustrating space weatheri made by primary school children from several countries are presented on the website.
