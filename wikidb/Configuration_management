56.6	Configuration_management	Configuration management	Configuration management (CM) is a process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a productâ€™s performance, functional and physical attributes with its requirements, design and operational information throughout its life. The CM process is widely used by military engineering organizations to manage complex systems, such as weapon systems, vehicles, and information systems. Outside of the military, the CM process is now used with many domain models in the civil engineering and other industrial engineering segments such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/ConfiurationActivityModel.png/400px-ConfiurationActivityModel.png
