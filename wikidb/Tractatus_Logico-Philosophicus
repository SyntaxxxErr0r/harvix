77.7	Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus	Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus	The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Latin for "Logical-Philosophical Treatise") is the only book-length philosophical work published by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in his lifetime. It was an ambitious project: to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science. It is recognized as a significant philosophical work of the twentieth century. G. E. Moore originally suggested the work's Latin title as homage to Tractatus Theologico-Politicus by Baruch Spinoza.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Tractatus_title_page_1922_Harcourt.png/200px-Tractatus_title_page_1922_Harcourt.png
