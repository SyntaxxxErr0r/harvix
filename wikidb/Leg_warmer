21.02	Leg_warmer	Leg warmer	Leg warmers are coverings for the lower legs, similar to socks but thicker and generally footless. They were originally used as dancewear by ballet and other classic dancers in order to keep the leg muscles warm and to prevent cramping or other muscle injuries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Legwarmers1.jpg/220px-Legwarmers1.jpg
