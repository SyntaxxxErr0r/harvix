3.10	Flanking_manoeuvre	Flanking maneuver	In military tactics, a flanking maneuver, also called a flank attack, is an attack on the sides of an opposing force. If a flanking maneuver succeeds, the opposing force would be surrounded from two or more directions, which significantly reduces the maneuverability of the outflanked force and its ability to defend itself. A psychological advantage may also be present, as flank forces usually do not expect to be attacked.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Battle_of_Marathon_Greek_Double_Envelopment.png/350px-Battle_of_Marathon_Greek_Double_Envelopment.png
