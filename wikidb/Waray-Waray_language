16.31	Waray-Waray_language	Waray-Waray language	Wáray-Wáray (commonly spelled as Waray; also referred to as Winaray or Lineyte-Samarnon) or Samarnon is a language spoken in the provinces of Samar, Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, and in some parts of the Leyte and Biliran in the Philippines. The name comes from the word often heard by non-speakers, "waray" (meaning "none", "nothing" or "not"), in the same way that Cebuanos are known in Leyte as "mga Kana" (after the oft-heard word "kana", meaning "that", among people speaking the Cebuano language).
