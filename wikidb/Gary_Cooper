He was renowned for his quiet, understated acting style and his stoic, but at times intense screen persona, which was particularly well suited to the many Westerns he made. He also excelled in sophisticated, screwball romantic comedies. His career spanned from 1925 until shortly before his death in 1961, and comprised more than one hundred films.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Gary_cooper_promo_image.jpg/220px-Gary_cooper_promo_image.jpg
