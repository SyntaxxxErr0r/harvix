54.3	Nanomaterials	Nanomaterials	Nanomaterials is a field that takes a materials science-based approach to nanotechnology. It studies materials with morphological features on the nanoscale, and especially those that have special properties stemming from their nanoscale dimensions. Nanoscale is usually defined as smaller than a one tenth of a micrometer in at least one dimension, though this term is sometimes also used for materials smaller than one micrometer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Buckminsterfullerene_animated.gif/220px-Buckminsterfullerene_animated.gif
