6.00	Spanish_maraved%C3%AD	Spanish maravedí	The gold dinar was first struck in Spain under Abd-ar-Rahman III, Emir of Córdoba (912-961). During the 11th century, the dinar became known as the morabit or morabotin throughout Europe. In the 12th century, it was copied by the Christian rulers Ferdinand II of León (1157–1188) and Alphonso VIII of Castile (1158–1214). Alfonso's gold marabotin or maravedí retained inscriptions in Arabic but had the letters ALF at the bottom. Ferdinand's gold maravedí weighed about 3.8 g.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Anverso4MaravRRCC.JPG/150px-Anverso4MaravRRCC.JPG
