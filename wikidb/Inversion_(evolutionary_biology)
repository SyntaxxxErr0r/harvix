3.20	Inversion_(evolutionary_biology)	Inversion (evolutionary biology)	In addition to the simple observation that the dorsoventral axes of protostomes and chordates appear to be inverted with respect to each other, molecular biology provides some support for the inversion hypothesis. The most notable piece of evidence comes from analysis of the genes involved in establishing the DV axis in these two groups. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, as well as in other protostomes, the Î²-type transforming growth factor family member decapentaplegic (dpp) is expressed dorsally and is thought to suppress neural fate. On the ventral side of the embryo, a dpp inhibitor, short gastrulation (sog), is expressed, thus allowing nervous tissue to form ventrally. In chordates, the dpp homolog BMP-4 is expressed in the prospective ventral (non-neural) part of the embryo while several sog-like BMP inhibitors (Chordin, Noggin, Follistatin) are expressed dorsally.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/DV-axis-inversion.png/270px-DV-axis-inversion.png
