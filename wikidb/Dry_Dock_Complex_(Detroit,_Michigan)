1.01	Dry_Dock_Complex_(Detroit,_Michigan)	Dry Dock Complex (Detroit, Michigan)	The Dry Dock Engine Works-Detroit Dry Dock Company Complex consists of a complex of six interconnected buildings located at 1801â€“1803 Atwater Street in Detroit, Michigan, as well as the remains of a nearby dry dock at 1900 Atwater Street. The 1801-1803 Atwater complex is also known as the Globe Trading Company Building. The complex is significant as the remnants of Detroit's once considerable maritime manufacturing industry. The earliest structure, an 1892 machine shop, is also significant as an early example of an industrial building entirely supported by its steel frame, but using traditional brick and standard windows to infill the curtain walls. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. It is under redevelopment as a mixed use residential and retail complex along the city's east riverfront promenade.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Detroit_Dry_Dock_Complex_2009.jpg/250px-Detroit_Dry_Dock_Complex_2009.jpg
