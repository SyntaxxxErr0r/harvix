1.00	It's_Alive_(TV_series)	It's Alive! (TV series)	It's Alive! was a Canadian children's variety show that aired on YTV from 1993 until 1997. Coined "the least educational show on television", the show mainly consisted of comedy sketches, celebrity interviews, musical performances, game shows, and obstacle challenges. In its original six-episode first season, episodes were 1Â½ hours long, which also contained an episode of programs including Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Are You Afraid of the Dark?, and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. Starting in the second season, the show was cut back to one hour with the television programs dropped from the show. In the fourth and final season, the show was cut to a half hour. A unique aspect of the show was the use of product placements including 3DO, Crispers, and Canada Games. The game show Uh Oh! (which was originally based on a game show parody sketch) became a spin-off show after It's Alive! ended.
