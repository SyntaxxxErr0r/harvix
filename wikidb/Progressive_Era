94.9	Progressive_Era	Progressive Era	The Progressive Era in the United States was a period of social activism and political reform that flourished from the 1840s to the 1920s. One main goal of the Progressive movement was purification of government, as Progressives tried to eliminate corruption by exposing and undercutting political machines and bosses. Many (but not all) Progressives supported prohibition in order to destroy the political power of local bosses based in saloons. At the same time, women's suffrage was promoted to bring a "purer" female vote into the arena. A second theme was achieving efficiency in every sector by identifying old ways that needed modernizing, and emphasizing scientific, medical and engineering solutions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Lindsey_ben.jpg/250px-Lindsey_ben.jpg
