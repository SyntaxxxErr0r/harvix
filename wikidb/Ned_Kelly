59.2	Ned_Kelly	Ned Kelly	Edward "Ned" Kelly (June 1854/June 1855 – 11 November 1880) was an Irish Australian bushranger. He is considered by some to be merely a cold-blooded cop killer — others, however, consider him to be a folk hero and symbol of Irish Australian resistance against the Anglo-Australian ruling class.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Ned_Kelly_in_1880.png/220px-Ned_Kelly_in_1880.png
