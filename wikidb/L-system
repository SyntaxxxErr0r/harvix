94.7	L-system	L-system	As a biologist, Lindenmayer worked with yeast and filamentous fungi and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria Anabaena catenula. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Fractal_weeds.jpg/300px-Fractal_weeds.jpg
