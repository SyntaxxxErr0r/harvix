35.04	Flood_myth	Flood myth	A flood myth or deluge myth is a symbolic narrative of a great flood sent by a deity or deities to destroy civilization as an act of divine retribution. It is a theme widespread among many cultures, though perhaps the most well known examples in modern times are the biblical and Quranic account of Noah's Ark, the foundational myths of the Quich√© and Mayas, through Deucalion in Greek mythology, the story of Utnapishtim in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Hindu puranic story of Manu. Parallels are often drawn between the flood waters of these myths and the primeval waters found in some creation myths since the flood waters are seen to cleanse humanity in preparation for rebirth. Most flood myths also contain a culture hero who strives to ensure this rebirth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_The_Holy_Bible_-_Plate_I%2C_The_Deluge.jpg/240px-Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_The_Holy_Bible_-_Plate_I%2C_The_Deluge.jpg
