80.0	John_Titor	John Titor	John Titor is the name used on several bulletin boards during 2000 and 2001 by a poster claiming to be a time traveler from the year 2036. In these posts he made numerous predictions (a number of them vague, some quite specific) about events in the near future, starting with events in 2004. However, as of 2012, these events appear not to have taken place; he described a drastically changed future in which the United States had broken into five smaller regions, the environment and infrastructure had been devastated by a nuclear attack, and most other world powers had been destroyed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/Titor_insignia.jpg/220px-Titor_insignia.jpg
