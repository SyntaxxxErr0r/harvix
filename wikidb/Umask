30.27	Umask	umask	Early UNIX systems were often used by relatively small groups of close colleagues who found it convenient to have most files read/write by everyone. PWB/UNIX evolved in a computer center environment to serve hundreds of users from different organizations. Its developers had combed through the commands to make key file creation modes more restrictive, especially for cases exposing security holes, but this was not a general solution. The addition of umask (in around 1978) allowed sites, groups, and individuals to choose their own defaults. Small close groups might choose 000, computer centers 022, security-conscious groups 077 or 066 for access to sub-directories under private directories.
