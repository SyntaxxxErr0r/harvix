65.1	Q_(James_Bond)	Q (James Bond)	Q is a fictional character in the James Bond novels and films. Q (standing for Quartermaster), like M, is a job title rather than a name. He is the head of Q Branch (or later Q Division), the fictional research and development division of the British Secret Service. The character actually appears only fleetingly in Ian Fleming's novels, but comes into his own in the successful Bond film series; he is also mentioned in the continuation novels of John Gardner and Raymond Benson.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ad/James_Bond_films_Qs.jpg/250px-James_Bond_films_Qs.jpg
