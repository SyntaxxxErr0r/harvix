Thereafter, the institute moved to Montpellier. This institute was mainly known for its inclusion on the list of dangerous cults established by the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France in the 1995 report, which led to a public controversy involving the American Department of State and several international associations which disapproved the decision.
