54.6	Value_at_risk	Value at risk	In financial mathematics and financial risk management, Value at Risk (VaR) is a widely used risk measure of the risk of loss on a specific portfolio of financial assets. For a given portfolio, probability and time horizon, VaR is defined as a threshold value such that the probability that the mark-to-market loss on the portfolio over the given time horizon exceeds this value (assuming normal markets and no trading in the portfolio) is the given probability level.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/VaR_diagram.JPG/300px-VaR_diagram.JPG
