67.6	Transnistria	Transnistria	Transnistria (also called "Trans-Dniestr" or "Transdniestria") is a breakaway territory located mostly on a strip of land between the Dniester River and the eastern Moldovan border to Ukraine. Since its declaration of independence in 1990, and especially after the War of Transnistria in 1992, it is governed as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR, also known as "Pridnestrovie"), a state with limited recognition which claims the territory to the east of the river Dniester, the city of Bender and its surrounding localities located on the west bank. The Republic of Moldova does not recognize the secession and considers territories controlled by the PMR to be part of Moldova's autonomous region of St√Ænga Nistrului ("Left Bank of the Dniester").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Transnistria_State_Flag.svg/125px-Transnistria_State_Flag.svg.png
