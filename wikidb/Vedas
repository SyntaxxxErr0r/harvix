98.8	Vedas	Vedas	The Vedas (Sanskrit , "knowledge") are a large body of texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism. The Vedas are ("not of human agency"). They are supposed to have been directly revealed, and thus are called ("what is heard"), distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called ("what is remembered").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Rigveda_MS2097.jpg/300px-Rigveda_MS2097.jpg
