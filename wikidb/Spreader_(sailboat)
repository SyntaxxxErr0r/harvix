7.10	Spreader_(sailboat)	Spreader (sailboat)	A spreader is a spar on a sailboat used to deflect the shrouds to allow them to better support the mast. Often, there are multiples, called spreaders. The spreader or spreaders serve much the same purpose as the crosstrees and tops in a traditional sailing vessel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Mast_mit_Salinge.jpg/250px-Mast_mit_Salinge.jpg
