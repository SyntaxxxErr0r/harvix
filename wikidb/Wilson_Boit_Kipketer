1.10	Wilson_Boit_Kipketer	Wilson Boit Kipketer	Wilson Boit Kipketer (born: October 6, 1973 in Kenya, one of twelve children) is a middle and long distance athlete most widely known for running the 3000 m steeplechase. On August 13, 1997, at the Weltklasse ZÃ¼rich, he set the world record in the steeplechase at 7:59.08, the third of three world records set in a 70 minute period of time. Boit Kipketer's record only stood for 11 days before it was crushed by Bernard Barmasai who took almost 3 and a half seconds off the mark. A week earlier, Boit Kipketer led a Kenyan sweep of the same race in the 1997 World Championships, edging out Barmasai and then world record holder, three-time defending champion Moses Kiptanui. He came back two years later to claim a silver medal in the 1999 World Championships and the following year in the 2000 Olympics.
