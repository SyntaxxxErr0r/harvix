177.4	Insomnia	Insomnia	Insomnia (or sleeplessness) is most often defined by an individual's report of sleeping difficulties. While the term is sometimes used in sleep literature to describe a disorder demonstrated by polysomnographic evidence of disturbed sleep, insomnia is often defined as a positive response to either of two questions: "Do you experience difficulty sleeping?" or "Do you have difficulty falling or staying asleep?"	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Complications_of_insomnia.svg/275px-Complications_of_insomnia.svg.png
