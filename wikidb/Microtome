15.23	Microtome	Microtome	A microtome (from the Greek mikros, meaning "small", and temnein, meaning "to cut") is a sectioning instrument that allows for the cutting of extremely thin slices of material, known as sections. Microtomes are an important device in microscopy preparation, allowing for the preparation of samples for observation under transmitted light or electron radiation. Microtomes use steel, glass, or diamond blades depending upon the specimen being sliced and the desired thickness of the sections being cut. Steel blades are used to prepare sections of animal or plant tissues for light microscopy histology. Glass knives are used to slice sections for light microscopy and to slice very thin sections for electron microscopy. Industrial grade diamond knives are used to slice hard materials such as bone, teeth and plant matter for both light microscopy and for electron microscopy. Gem quality diamond knives are used for slicing thin sections for electron microscopy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Ultramicrotome_2265_EM_GD_MB.jpg/200px-Ultramicrotome_2265_EM_GD_MB.jpg
