59.9	American_Football_League	American Football League	The American Football League (AFL) was a major American Professional Football league that operated from 1960 until 1969, when the established National Football League (NFL) merged with it. The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence. Though downplayed by the NFL as inferior, the AFL signed half of the NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960, including All-American Billy Cannon, perennial All-Star Johnny Robinson, and Hall of Famer Ron Mix. Overall, AFL teams signed 75% of the league's draft choices that first year. It continued to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s, well before the Common Draft which began in 1967.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/AmericanFootballLeague.png/150px-AmericanFootballLeague.png
