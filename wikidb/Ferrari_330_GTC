1.00	Ferrari_330_GTC	Ferrari 330	The Ferrari 330 cars are the successor of the 250, first introduced by Ferrari in 1963. The first 330 America was simply a 250 GT/E with a larger engine, and the 330 GTC/GTS shared their chassis with the 275. Only the 330 GT 2+2 was a truly unique product. Production ended in 1968 with the introduction of the Ferrari 365 series.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Ferrari_330_gtc.jpg/250px-Ferrari_330_gtc.jpg
