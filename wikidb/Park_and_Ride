6.11	Park_and_Ride	Park and ride	Park and ride (or incentive parking) facilities are car parks with connections to public transport that allow commuters and other people wishing to travel into city centres to leave their vehicles and transfer to a bus, rail system , or carpool for the rest of their trip. The vehicle is stored in the car park during the day and retrieved when the owner returns. Park and rides are generally located in the suburbs of metropolitan areas or on the outer edges of large cities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/ParkAndRideSignOxford20050910.JPG
