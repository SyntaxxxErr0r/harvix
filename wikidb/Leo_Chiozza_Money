3.00	Leo_Chiozza_Money	Leo Chiozza Money	Sir Leo George Chiozza Money (13 June 1870 â€“ 25 September 1944), born Leone Giorgio Chiozza, was an Italian-born economic theorist who moved to Britain in the 1890s, where he made his name as a politician, journalist and author. In the early years of the 20th century his views attracted the interest of two future Prime Ministers, David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. After a spell as Lloyd George's parliamentary private secretary, he was a Government minister in the latter stages of the First World War. In later life the police's handling of a case in which he and a young woman were acquitted of indecent behaviour aroused much political and public interest, while a few years later he was convicted of an offence involving another woman.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Leo_Chiozza_Money.jpg/220px-Leo_Chiozza_Money.jpg
