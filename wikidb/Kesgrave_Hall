2.10	Kesgrave_Hall	Kesgrave Hall	According to British Isles Genealogy, the hall was purchased around 1814 by William Cunliffe Shawe, and by 1844 was inhabited by his son, Robert Newton Shawe, a magistrate and joint Chairman of the Woodbridge quarter sessions, who at one point represented Suffolk in Parliament; the Shawes were descended from "an eminent merchant of Liverpool" according to the British Gazetteer. According to a report published in 1846 by the Committee of Council on Education Robert Shawe funded the local school, which educated 238 pupils between ages 7 and 14 (11 in the case of boys), where discipline was said to be good but not as strict as was usual in "good national schools", and that the pupils' knowledge of "Holy Scripture" was particularly notable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Kesgrave_Hall_-_1907_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1031512.jpg/220px-Kesgrave_Hall_-_1907_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1031512.jpg
