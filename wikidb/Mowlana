1.00	Mowlana	Rumi	Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Balkhī , also known as Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī ( Persian pronunciation: ) and popularly known as Mevlānā in Turkey and Mawlānā (Persian: ‎ Persian pronunciation: ) in Iran and Afghanistan but known to the English-speaking world simply as Rumi (30 September 1207 – 17 December 1273) was a 13th-century Persian Muslim poet, jurist, theologian, and Sufi mystic. Rūmī is a descriptive name meaning "Roman" since he lived most of his life in an area called "Rûm" (then under the control of Seljuq dynasty) because it was once ruled by the Eastern Roman Empire. He was one of the figures who flourished in the Sultanate of Rum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Andr04.jpg/220px-Andr04.jpg
