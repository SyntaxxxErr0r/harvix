3.00	English_sweat	Sweating sickness	Sweating sickness, also known as "English sweating sickness" or "English sweate" (Latin: ), was a mysterious and highly virulent disease that struck England, and later continental Europe, in a series of epidemics beginning in 1485. The last outbreak occurred in 1551, after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was dramatic and sudden, with death often occurring within hours. Its cause remains unknown.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Holbein_Henry_Brandon_2nd_Duke_of_Suffolk.jpg/180px-Holbein_Henry_Brandon_2nd_Duke_of_Suffolk.jpg
