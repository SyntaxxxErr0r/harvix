152.9	Gratis_versus_Libre	Gratis versus libre	Gratis versus libre is the distinction between two meanings of the English adjective "free"; namely, "for zero price" and "with little or no restriction" (libre). The ambiguity of "free" can cause issues where the distinction is important, as it often is in dealing with laws concerning the use of information, such as copyright and patents.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Free_Beer.jpg/220px-Free_Beer.jpg
