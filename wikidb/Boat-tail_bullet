It is important to understand the effect of gravity when zeroing the sighting components of a gun. To plan for bullet drop and compensate properly, one must understand parabolic shaped trajectories.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/M855_drop_during_25-meter_zeroing_trajectory_M16A2_M4.jpg/300px-M855_drop_during_25-meter_zeroing_trajectory_M16A2_M4.jpg
