70.1	Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe	Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe	Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe began shortly after destruction of productive capacity in Zimbabwe's civil war and confiscation of white-owned farmland. Food output capacity fell 45%, manufacturing output 29% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 28% in 2007, and unemployment rose to 80%. During the height of inflation from 2008â€“09, it was difficult to accurately account and monitor for Zimbabwe's hyperinflation because the government of Zimbabwe stopped filing official inflation statistics. This cessation in filing made it difficult to accurately observe how severe inflation was in the country. By December 2008, inflation was estimated at 6.5 quindecillion novemdecillion percent (that's 6.5 x 10108 % which is 65 followed by 107 zeros). In 2009 Zimbabwe abandoned its currency; at present in 2012 a new currency has yet to be introduced, so currencies from other countries are used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Zimbabwe_Hyperinflation_2008_notes.jpg/220px-Zimbabwe_Hyperinflation_2008_notes.jpg
