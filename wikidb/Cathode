62.1	Cathode	Cathode	A cathode is an electrode through which electric current flows out of a polarized electrical device. The direction of electric current is, by convention, opposite to the direction of electron flow. Therefore the electrons flow into the polarized electrical device and out of, for example, the connected electrical circuit. Mnemonic: CCD (Cathode Current Departs).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Copper_cathode_2.png/220px-Copper_cathode_2.png
