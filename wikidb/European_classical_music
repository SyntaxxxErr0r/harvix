80.1	European_classical_music	Classical music	Classical music is the art music produced in, or rooted in, the traditions of Western liturgical and secular music, encompassing a broad period from roughly the 11th century to present times. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period. It should not be confused with the Classical Era.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Classical_music_composers_montage.JPG/350px-Classical_music_composers_montage.JPG
