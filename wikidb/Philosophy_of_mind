63.1	Philosophy_of_mind	Philosophy of mind	Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain. The mind-body problem, i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Phrenology1.jpg/200px-Phrenology1.jpg
