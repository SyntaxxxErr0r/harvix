63.0	Delaware_River	Delaware River	The Delaware River is a major river on the Atlantic coast of the United States first mapped by a Dutch expedition led by Henry Hudson in 1609. The river was christened the South River in the New Netherland colony that followed, in contrast to the North River, as the Hudson River was then known. The name Delaware, for Sir Thomas West 3rd Baron De La Warr, was used by the English and became standard following the English conquest of New Netherland in 1664.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Delaware_River_DWG_USA.jpg/300px-Delaware_River_DWG_USA.jpg
