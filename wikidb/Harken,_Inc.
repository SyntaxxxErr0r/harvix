3.00	Harken,_Inc.	Harken, Inc.	Harken Yacht Equipment is an international performance sailing hardware manufacturer headquartered in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA. The company was founded in a 60-foot trailer in 1967 by brothers Peter Harken and Olaf Harken. Originally, the brothers manufactured sailboats under the name Vanguard and kept the hardware business separate so they could sell to competing boatbuilders. Gary Comer, founder of Lands' End clothing company, advised and helped them distribute their first blocks by placing them in the Lands' End catalogue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Harken-logo.svg/200px-Harken-logo.svg.png
