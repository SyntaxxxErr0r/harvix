1.00	Portal%3AComputer_Science	Portal:Computer science	Computer science is the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems. Computing science encompasses many branches; some emphasize the computation of specific results (such as computer graphics), while others (such as computational complexity theory) relate to properties of computational problems. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, programming language theory studies approaches to describing a computation, while computer programming applies specific programming languages to craft a solution to some concrete computational problems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg/125px-Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg.png
