93.6	Rapid_application_development	Rapid application development	Rapid application development is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The "planning" of software developed using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/RADModel.JPG/320px-RADModel.JPG
