1.00	Cheyenne_River_Sioux_Reservation	Cheyenne River Indian Reservation	The Cheyenne River Indian Reservation was created by the United States in 1889 by breaking up the Great Sioux Reservation, following its victory over the Lakota in a series of wars in the 1870s. The reservation covers almost all of Dewey and Ziebach counties in South Dakota. In addition, many small parcels of off-reservation trust land are located in Stanley, Haakon, and Meade counties.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Cheyenne_River_IR.jpg/225px-Cheyenne_River_IR.jpg
