27.26	Reflectivity	Reflectivity	In optics and photometry, reflectivity is the fraction of incident radiation reflected by a surface. In general it must be treated as a directional property that is a function of the reflected direction, the incident direction, and the incident wavelength. However it is also commonly averaged over the reflected hemisphere to give the hemispherical spectral reflectivity:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Image-Metal-reflectance.png/400px-Image-Metal-reflectance.png
