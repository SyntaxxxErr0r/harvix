This village is located in environmentallye rich mountains of the Western Ghats. The word manathra evolves from the name of a tribal groups called Mannan. Mannans were the early inhabitants of in the region. This was a place with rich megalithic sites in the early twentieth century. Continuous human intervention in the terrain destroyed most of the historically rich sites. It is therefore becoming difficult to shed light on the early history of this region. But it is important to do further research on the human interaction in the pre-historic western Ghats.
