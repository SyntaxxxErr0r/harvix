94.1	BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop	BBC Radiophonic Workshop	Perhaps the most significant recording in Radiophonic Workshop history came in 1963 when they were approached by composer Ron Grainer to record a theme tune for the upcoming BBC television series Doctor Who. Presented with the task of "realising" Grainer's score, complete with its descriptions of "sweeps", "swoops", "wind clouds" and "wind bubbles", Delia Derbyshire created a piece of musique concr√®te which has become one of television's most recognisable themes. Over the next quarter-century the Workshop contributed greatly to the programme providing its vast range of unusual sound-effects, from the TARDIS dematerialisation to the Sonic screwdriver, as well as much of the programme's distinctive electronic incidental music, including every score from 1980 to 1985. Such is the relationship between the two that to many the phrase "Radiophonic Workshop" will always be associated with the programme, often to the detriment of the reputation of the Workshop's other output.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Dick_Mills%2C_BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop_at_the_Roundhouse%2C_2009-05-17.jpg/300px-Dick_Mills%2C_BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop_at_the_Roundhouse%2C_2009-05-17.jpg
