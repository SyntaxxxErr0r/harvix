1.00	Wave_Picking	Wave picking	Wave picking is a term for a process used in a Warehouse Management System to describe a process to support managing the work of a warehouse or distribution center. Wave Picking is an application of a Short Interval Scheduling, to assign the workload into intervals (waves) to allow management to coordinate the several parallel and sequential activities to complete the work. The Wave data includes the workload by order or function (case picking, repack picking, pallet movement, pick position replenishment, packing, etc.) providing management the information to calculate staff requirements and assign staff by function, with the expectation that the work in each function, within each wave, can be started and be completed at about the same time. There are two basic planning elements and benefits of wave picking.
