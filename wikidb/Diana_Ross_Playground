4.01	Diana_Ross_Playground	Diana Ross Playground	The Diana Ross Playground is located in New York City's Central Park, inside the park at West 81st Street and Central Park West. Its namesake, the recording artist Diana Ross, who lives across the street in The Beresford, gave a fabled 1983 free concert in Central Park and pledged to fund the project with proceeds from the television rights; however, when this did not prove profitable, she used personal resources. Groundbreaking took place in September 1986, with both Ross and then-Mayor Ed Koch present. Ross reportedly called the event "one of the most fulfilling aspects of life and career."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/DianaRossPlayground_NYC.jpg/220px-DianaRossPlayground_NYC.jpg
