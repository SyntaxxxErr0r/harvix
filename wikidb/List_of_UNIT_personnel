6.12	List_of_UNIT_personnel	List of UNIT personnel	Brigadier Winifred Bambera, played by Angela Bruce, appeared in the Seventh Doctor serial Battlefield (1989) as UNIT's commanding officer. She worked alongside the Seventh Doctor, Ace (whom the Doctor had initially passed off as UNIT's former Scientific Advisor, Liz Shaw, with Liz's old security pass), and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (pulled out of retirement for the duration of the crisis), in defeating the extra-dimensional forces of Morgaine and Mordred in Carbury. She was in command during the mid-1990s and was tasked with transporting a nuclear missile across Britain. Bambera is shown able to fight with weapons and in hand-to-hand combat. She took a no-nonsense, by-the-book approach to command that warranted the respect of those under her. Major Husak and Sergeant Zbrigniev reported directly to her. She uses the word "shame" as an expletive.
