114.2	Pandora's_box	Pandora's box	Pandora's Box is an artifact in Greek mythology, taken from the myth of Pandora's creation in Hesiod's Works and Days. The "box" was actually a large jar (πίθος pithos) given to Pandora (Πανδώρα) ("all-gifted", "all-giving"), which contained all the evils of the world. When Pandora opened the jar, all its contents except for one item were released into the world. The one remaining item was Hope. Today, to open Pandora's box means to create evil that cannot be undone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Pandora_opening_her_box_by_James_Gillray.jpg/220px-Pandora_opening_her_box_by_James_Gillray.jpg
