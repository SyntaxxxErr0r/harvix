1.00	Zombie_(film)	Zombi 2	Zombi 2 (also known as Zombie, Island of the Living Dead, Zombie Island, Zombie Flesh Eaters and Woodoo) is a 1979 zombie horror film directed by Lucio Fulci. It is the best-known of Fulci's films and made him a horror icon. Though the title suggests this is a sequel to Zombi (the Italian title of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead), the films are unrelated. When the film was released in 1979 it was scorned for its extremely bloody content, notably by the UK's Conservative government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Zombie_Flesh_eaters.jpg/220px-Zombie_Flesh_eaters.jpg
