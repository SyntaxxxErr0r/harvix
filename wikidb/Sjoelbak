6.00	Sjoelbak	Table shuffleboard	Table shuffleboard (also known as American shuffleboard, indoor shuffleboard or shufflepuck) is a game in which players push metal-and-plastic weighted pucks (also called weights) down a long and smooth wooden table into a scoring area at the opposite end of the table. Shooting is performed with the hand directly, as opposed to deck shuffleboard's use of cue sticks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/TableShuffleboard_withBankboard.JPG/220px-TableShuffleboard_withBankboard.JPG
