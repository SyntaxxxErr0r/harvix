51.1	Tachyon	Tachyon	A tachyon ( ) (or tachyonic particle) is a hypothetical particle that always moves faster than light. Most physicists do not think that such particles exist or are consistent with the known laws of physics. Tachyons could be used to send signals faster than light, and (according to special relativity) this leads to violations of causality.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Tachyon04s.gif/250px-Tachyon04s.gif
