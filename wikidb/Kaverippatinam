1.00	Kaverippatinam	Puhar	Puhar is a town in the Nagapattinam district in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It was once a flourishing ancient port city known as Kaveri puhum pattinam, which for a while served as the capital of the early Chola kings in Tamilakkam. It is located near the end point of the Kaveri river, aside the sea coast. Much of the town was washed away by what is now speculated to be a tsunami around 500 AD. Ancient pottery dating back to the 4th or 5th century AD have been discovered off shore around this town.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Picurt.jpg
