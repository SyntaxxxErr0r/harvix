77.1	Aphid	Aphid	Aphids, also known as plant lice and in Britain and the Commonwealth as greenflies, blackflies or whiteflies, (not to be confused with "jumping plant lice" or true whiteflies) are small sap sucking insects, and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of farmers and gardeners the world over, but from a zoological standpoint they are a very successful group of organisms. Their success is in part due to the asexual reproduction capability of some species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Acyrthosiphon_pisum_%28pea_aphid%29-PLoS.jpg/220px-Acyrthosiphon_pisum_%28pea_aphid%29-PLoS.jpg
