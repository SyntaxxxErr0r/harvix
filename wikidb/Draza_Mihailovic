2.00	Draza_Mihailovic	Draža Mihailović	Dragoljub "Draža" Mihailović (Cyrillic script: Драгољуб "Дража" Михаиловић; also known as "Uncle Draža"; 27 April 1893 – 17 July 1946) was a Yugoslav Serbian general during World War II. A staunch royalist, he retreated to the mountains near Belgrade when the Germans overran Yugoslavia in April 1941 and there he organized bands of guerrillas known as the Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army. The organisation is commonly known as the Chetniks, although the name of the organisation was later changed to the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland (JVUO, ЈВУО).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/144_Draza_Mihajlovic.jpg/240px-144_Draza_Mihajlovic.jpg
