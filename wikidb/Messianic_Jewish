2.00	Messianic_Jewish	Messianic Judaism	Messianic Judaism is a syncretic religious movement that arose in the 1960s and 70s. It blends evangelical Christian theology with elements of Jewish terminology and ritual. Messianic Judaism states that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah and "God the Son" (one person of the Trinity), and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior. Any Jewish laws or customs that are followed are cultural and do not contribute to attaining salvation. Belief in the messiahship and divinity of Jesus, which Messianic Judaism shares, is viewed by many Christian denominations and Jewish religious movements as being a defining distinction between Christianity and Judaism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/P_christianity.svg/100px-P_christianity.svg.png
