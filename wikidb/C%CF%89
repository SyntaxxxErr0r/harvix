12.20	C%CF%89	Cω	Cω is a free extension to the C# programming language, developed by the WebData team in Microsoft SQL Server in collaboration with Microsoft Research in the UK and Redmond. It was formerly known as the codenames "X#" (X Sharp) and "Xen". It was renamed Cω after Polyphonic C#, another research language based on Join calculus, was integrated into it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/ComegaLogo.png/250px-ComegaLogo.png
