70.7	Lychee	Lychee	The lychee is the sole member of the genus Litchi in the soapberry family, Sapindaceae. It is a tropical and subtropical fruit tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia, and now cultivated in many parts of the world. The fresh fruit has a "delicate, whitish pulp" with a "perfume" flavor. Since this perfumy flavor is lost in canning, the fruit is usually eaten fresh.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Litchi_chinensis_fruits.JPG/220px-Litchi_chinensis_fruits.JPG
