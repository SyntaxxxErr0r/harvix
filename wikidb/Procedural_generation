69.9	Procedural_generation	Procedural generation	The term procedural refers to the process that computes a particular function. Fractals, an example of procedural generation , dramatically express this concept, around which a whole body of mathematics—fractal geometry—has evolved. Commonplace procedural content includes textures and meshes. Sound is often procedurally generated as well and has applications in both speech synthesis as well as music. It has been used to create compositions in various genres of electronic music by artists such as Brian Eno who popularized the term "generative music".
