2.00	Wood_Creek	Wood Creek	Wood Creek is a creek in central New York and flows from Rome, New York to Fish Creek in Sylvan Beach (and then Oneida Lake). It is the west-flowing waterway of the Oneida Carry, an important portage in the early history of New York. It flows into Oneida Lake, and from there a boat could pass via the Oswego River all the way to Lake Ontario, and onto the rest of the Great Lakes system.
