60.4	Jester	Jester	A jester, joker, jokester, fool, wit-cracker, prankster, or buffoon was a person employed to tell jokes and provide general entertainment, typically for a European monarch. Jesters are stereotypically thought to have worn brightly coloured clothes and eccentric hats in a motley pattern. Their hats were especially distinctive; typically made of cloth, they were floppy with three points, each of which had a jingle bell at the end. The three points of the hat represent donkey's ears and nose and tail worn by jesters in earlier times. Other things distinctive about the jester were his laughter and his mock sceptre, known as a "bauble" or marotte.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/William_Merritt_Chase_Keying_up.jpg/220px-William_Merritt_Chase_Keying_up.jpg
