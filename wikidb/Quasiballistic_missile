4.00	Quasiballistic_missile	Ballistic missile	A ballistic missile is a missile that follows a sub-orbital ballistic flightpath with the objective of delivering one or more warheads to a predetermined target. The missile is only guided during the relatively brief initial powered phase of flight and its course is subsequently governed by the laws of orbital mechanics and ballistics. To date, ballistic missiles have been propelled during powered flight by chemical rocket engines of various types.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/V-2_rocket_diagram_%28with_English_labels%29.svg/350px-V-2_rocket_diagram_%28with_English_labels%29.svg.png
