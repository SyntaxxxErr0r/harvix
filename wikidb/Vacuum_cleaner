60.7	Vacuum_cleaner	Vacuum cleaner	A vacuum cleaner is a device that uses an air pump to create a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors, and optionally from other surfaces as well. The dirt is collected by either a dustbag or a cyclone for later disposal. Vacuum cleaners, which are used in homes as well as in industry, exist in a variety of sizes and modelsâ€” small battery-operated hand-held devices, domestic central vacuum cleaners, huge stationary industrial appliances that can handle several hundred litres of dust before being emptied, and self-propelled vacuum trucks for recovery of large spills or removal of contaminated soil.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Vacuum_cleaner.jpg/220px-Vacuum_cleaner.jpg
