The plot centers around Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Spike, and Petrie, who are excited to meet two yellow-bellied Beipiaosaurus, Loofah and Doofah, who have lost their way while traveling to distant Berry Valley. Loofah and Doofah seem to be too unintelligent to find their way back, so Littlefoot and the others decide to help their new friends whilst sharing important life lessons called Wisdoms along the way. By the time they reach Berry Valley, Littlefoot realizes that even though the yellow bellies do not follow his Wisdoms very well, their silly techniques work just fine. This is also the last film in the Land Before Time series, following the recent closure of Universal Animation Studios's offices.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/The_Wisdom_of_Friends.jpg/220px-The_Wisdom_of_Friends.jpg
