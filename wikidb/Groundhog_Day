172.3	Groundhog_Day	Groundhog Day	Groundhog Day is a day celebrated on February 2. According to folklore, if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day, then spring will come early. If it is sunny, the groundhog will supposedly see its shadow and retreat back into its burrow, and the winter weather will continue for six more weeks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Groundhogday2005.jpg/225px-Groundhogday2005.jpg
