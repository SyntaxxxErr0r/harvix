73.4	Recorder	Recorder	The recorder is a woodwind musical instrument of the family known as fipple flutes or internal duct flutesâ€”whistle-like instruments which include the tin whistle. The recorder is end-blown and the mouth of the instrument is constricted by a wooden plug, known as a block or fipple. It is distinguished from other members of the family by having holes for seven fingers (the lower one or two often doubled to facilitate the production of semitones) and one for the thumb of the uppermost hand. The bore of the recorder is tapered slightly, being widest at the mouthpiece end and narrowest towards the foot on Baroque recorders, or flared almost like a trumpet at the bottom on Renaissance instruments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/VariousRecorderFlutes.jpg/300px-VariousRecorderFlutes.jpg
