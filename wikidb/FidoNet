97.8	FidoNet	FidoNet	FidoNet is a worldwide computer network that is used for communication between bulletin board systems (BBSs). It uses a store and forward system to exchange private (email) and public (forum) messages between the BBSs in the network, as well as other files and protocols in some cases. To save on long distance calling charges when those were expensive, FidoNet used a number of techniques to ensure data was compressed using the then-latest methods of data compression.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/FidoNet_logo-2010.png/220px-FidoNet_logo-2010.png
