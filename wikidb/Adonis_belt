1.01	Adonis_belt	Apollo's belt	The iliac furrow, also known as an athlete's girdle, Apollo's Belt or an Adonis belt, is a term for a part of the human anatomy. It refers to either one of two shallow grooves of the surface anatomy of the human abdomen running from the iliac crest (hip bone) to the pubis. In some circles, it is colloquially referred to as the devil's shoulders and also as cum gutters. It is not a currently defined term in Terminologia Anatomica, though it has been used as a formal anatomical term in the past.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Roman_Statue_of_Apollo.jpg/220px-Roman_Statue_of_Apollo.jpg
