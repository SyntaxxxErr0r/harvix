57.4	Wuhan	Wuhan	In the late 19th century railroads were extended on a north-south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this time period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into various foreign controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Wuhan_montage.png/250px-Wuhan_montage.png
