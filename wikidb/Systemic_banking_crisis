1.00	Systemic_banking_crisis	Bank run	A bank run (also known as a run on the bank) occurs when a large number of customers withdraw their deposits because they believe the bank is, or might become, insolvent. As a bank run progresses, it generates its own momentum, in a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy (or positive feedback): as more people withdraw their deposits, the likelihood of default increases, and this encourages further withdrawals. This can destabilize the bank to the point where it faces bankruptcy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-12023%2C_Berlin%2C_Bankenkrach%2C_Andrang_bei_der_Sparkasse.jpg/350px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-12023%2C_Berlin%2C_Bankenkrach%2C_Andrang_bei_der_Sparkasse.jpg
