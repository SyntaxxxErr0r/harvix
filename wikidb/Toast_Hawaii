4.12	Toast_Hawaii	Toast Hawaii	Toast Hawaii is an open sandwich consisting of a slice of toast with ham, pineapple in the middle of a maraschino cherry and cheese, grilled from above, so that the cheese starts to melt. It was invented, or at least made popular, by the German TV cook Clemens Wilmenrod and is considered typical for West Germany in the 1950s. In the GDR such a sandwich was considered capitalist excess.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Toast_Hawaii_RZ.jpg/220px-Toast_Hawaii_RZ.jpg
