3.20	Amiga_CDTV	Commodore CDTV	The CDTV (for "Commodore Dynamic Total Vision") was a multimedia platform developed by Commodore International and launched in 1991. On a technological level it was essentially a Commodore Amiga 500 home computer in a Hi-Fi style case with a single-speed CD-ROM drive. Commodore marketed the machine as an all-in-one home multimedia appliance rather than a computer. As such, it targeted the same market as the Philips CD-i. Unfortunately for both Commodore and Philips, the expected market for multimedia appliances did not materialise, and neither machine met with any real commercial success. Though the CDTV was based entirely on Amiga hardware it was marketed strictly as a CDTV, with the Amiga name omitted from product branding.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/CDTV.jpg/250px-CDTV.jpg
