59.4	Aviator	Aviator	An aviator is a person who flies an aircraft. The first recorded use of the term was in 1887, as a variation of 'aviation', from the Latin avis (meaning bird), coined in 1863 by G. de la Landelle in Aviation Ou Navigation AÃ©rienne (Aviation or Air Navigation). The term aviatrix (aviatrice in French), now archaic, was formerly used for a female aviator.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Lt_Mike_Hunter_1.jpg/300px-Lt_Mike_Hunter_1.jpg
