100.3	Lord_of_the_Flies	Lord of the Flies	Lord of the Flies is a novel by Nobel Prize-winning author William Golding about a group of British boys stuck on a deserted island who try to govern themselves, with disastrous results.

In 2005 the novel was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. It was awarded a place on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching #41 on the editor's list, and #25 on the reader's list.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9b/LordOfTheFliesBookCover.jpg/200px-LordOfTheFliesBookCover.jpg
