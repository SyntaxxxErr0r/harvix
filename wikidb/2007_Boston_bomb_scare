58.6	2007_Boston_bomb_scare	2007 Boston bomb scare	The 2007 Boston bomb scare occurred on January 31, 2007 when the Boston Police Department mistakenly identified battery-powered LED placards resembling the Mooninite characters in the show Aqua Teen Hunger Force found throughout Boston, Massachusetts and the surrounding cities of Cambridge and Somerville as improvised explosive devices. The placards were part of a guerrilla marketing campaign for Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, a film based on the animated television series, Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/ATHF_LED_in_Cambridge.jpg/240px-ATHF_LED_in_Cambridge.jpg
