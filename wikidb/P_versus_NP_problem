70.1	P_versus_NP_problem	P versus NP problem	The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. It was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures" and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute to carry a US$ 1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Complexity_classes.svg/250px-Complexity_classes.svg.png
