1.00	Dimorphodon_macronyx	Dimorphodon	Dimorphodon ( ) was a genus of medium-sized pterosaur from the early Jurassic Period. It was named by paleontologist Richard Owen in 1859. Dimorphodon means "two-form tooth", derived from Greek δι/di meaning 'two', μορφη/morphe meaning 'shape' and οδων/odon meaning 'tooth', referring to the fact that it had two distinct types of teeth in its jaws - which is comparatively rare among reptiles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Dimorphodon_fossil.jpg/250px-Dimorphodon_fossil.jpg
