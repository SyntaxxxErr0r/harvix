51.4	Motion_(physics)	Motion (physics)	In physics, motion in the universe is described through two sets of apparently contradictory laws of mechanics. Motions of all large scale and familiar objects in the universe (such as projectiles, planets, cells, and humans) are described by classical mechanics. Whereas the motion of very small atomic and sub-atomic objects is described by quantum mechanics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Leaving_Yongsan_Station.jpg/300px-Leaving_Yongsan_Station.jpg
