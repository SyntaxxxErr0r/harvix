73.7	Rhythm	Rhythm	Rhythm (from Greek ῥυθμός—rhythmos, "any regular recurring motion, symmetry") may be generally defined as a "movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions." This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time may be applied to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to millions of years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Phenakistoscope_3g07690b.gif/220px-Phenakistoscope_3g07690b.gif
