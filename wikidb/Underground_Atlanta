15.40	Underground_Atlanta	Underground Atlanta	Underground Atlanta is a shopping and entertainment district in the Five Points neighborhood of downtown Atlanta, Georgia, United States, near the intersection of the east and west MARTA rail lines. First opened in 1969, it takes advantage of the viaducts built over the city's many railroad tracks to accommodate later automobile traffic. Each level has two main halls, still called Upper and Lower Alabama and Pryor Streets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Atlanta_Underground.jpg/220px-Atlanta_Underground.jpg
