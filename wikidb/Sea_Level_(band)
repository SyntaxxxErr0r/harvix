15.01	Sea_Level_(band)	Sea Level (band)	Sea Level is the name of a fusion group that mixed jazz, blues and rock. It existed between 1976 and 1981. Initially, it was an offshoot of The Allman Brothers Band, but as tensions grew between the loss of two of its founding members, and personal grievances between Gregg Allman and other bandmates and associates, Sea Level took on a life of its own as an independent band.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Sea_Level_-_Chuck_Leavell.jpg/300px-Sea_Level_-_Chuck_Leavell.jpg
