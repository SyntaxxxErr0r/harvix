The theological points remain at issue as the basis of current disagreements amongst some Protestants, particularly evangelicals. These debates go back in some form to Augustine of Hippo's battle with the Pelagians in the fifth century on theological cornerstones of soteriology, including depravity, predestination, and atonement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/James_Arminius_2.jpg/170px-James_Arminius_2.jpg
