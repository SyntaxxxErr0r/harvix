186.5	Tax	Tax	To tax (from the Latin taxo; "I estimate") is to impose a financial charge or other levy upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a state or the functional equivalent of a state such that failure to pay is punishable by law. Taxes are also imposed by many administrative divisions. Taxes consist of direct tax or indirect tax, and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent (often but not always unpaid labour).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Pieter_Brueghel_the_Younger%2C_%27Paying_the_Tax_%28The_Tax_Collector%29%27_oil_on_panel%2C_1620-1640._USC_Fisher_Museum_of_Art.jpg/300px-Pieter_Brueghel_the_Younger%2C_%27Paying_the_Tax_%28The_Tax_Collector%29%27_oil_on_panel%2C_1620-1640._USC_Fisher_Museum_of_Art.jpg
