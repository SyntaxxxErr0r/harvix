147.0	Dwarf_planet	Dwarf planet	A dwarf planet, as defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), is a celestial body in direct orbit of the Sun that is massive enough that its shape is controlled by gravitational rather than mechanical forces (and thus an ellipsoid in shape), but has not cleared its neighboring region of other objects. More explicitly, it is a planetary-mass object—having sufficient mass to overcome its compressive strength and achieve hydrostatic equilibrium—but not a satellite.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Ceres_optimized.jpg/220px-Ceres_optimized.jpg
