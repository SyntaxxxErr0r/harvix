54.9	Knoppix	Knoppix	Knoppix, or KNOPPIX ( -iks), is an operating system based on Debian designed to be run directly from a CD / DVD or a USB key (Live USB), one of the first of its kind for any operating system. Knoppix was developed by Linux consultant Klaus Knopper. When starting a program, it is loaded from the removable medium and decompressed into a RAM drive. The decompression is transparent and on-the-fly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/KNOPPIX6.0.1-LXDE.jpg/300px-KNOPPIX6.0.1-LXDE.jpg
