74.0	Sea_urchin	Sea urchin	Sea urchins or urchins are small, spiny, globular animals which, with their close kin, such as sand dollars, constitute the class Echinoidea of the echinoderm phylum. They inhabit all oceans. Their shell, or "test", is round and spiny, typically from 3 to 10 centimetres (1.2 to 3.9 in) across. Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, and red. They move slowly, feeding mostly on algae. Sea otters, wolf eels, triggerfish, and other predators feed on them. Their "roe" (actually the gonads) is a delicacy in many cuisines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Riccio_Melone_a_Capo_Caccia_adventurediving.it.jpg/250px-Riccio_Melone_a_Capo_Caccia_adventurediving.it.jpg
