4.00	Phase_control	Phase fired controllers	Phase control , also called phase cutting, is a method of pulse width modulation (PWM) for power limiting, applied to AC voltages. It works by modulating a thyristor, SCR, triac, thyratron, or other such gated diode-like devices into and out of conduction at a predetermined phase of the applied waveform.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Regulated_rectifier.gif/220px-Regulated_rectifier.gif
