55.8	Environment_(biophysical)	Environment (biophysical)	The biophysical environment is the biotic and abiotic surrounding of an organism, or population, and includes particularly the factors that have an influence in their survival, development and evolution. The naked term environment can make reference to different concepts, but it is often used as a short form for the biophysical environment. This practice is common, for instance, among governments, that usually name their departments and agencies dealing with the biophysical environment with denominations like Environment Agency. There is an infinite quantity of environments, because we can always consider an additional living organism, that has its own environment, never the less when we use the expression "the environment" we are talking about the global environment, and usually as referred to humanity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Nasa_blue_marble.jpg/220px-Nasa_blue_marble.jpg
