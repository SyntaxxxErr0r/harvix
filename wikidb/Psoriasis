120.9	Psoriasis	Psoriasis	Psoriasis ( ) is an autoimmune disease that appears on the skin. It occurs when the immune system mistakes the skin cells as a pathogen, and sends out faulty signals that speed up the growth cycle of skin cells. Psoriasis is not contagious. However, psoriasis has been linked to an increased risk of stroke, and treating high blood lipid levels may lead to improvement. There are five types of psoriasis: plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular and erythrodermic. The most common form, plaque psoriasis, is commonly seen as red and white hues of scaly patches appearing on the top first layer of the epidermis (skin). Some patients, though, have no dermatological symptoms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Psoriasis_on_back1.jpg/230px-Psoriasis_on_back1.jpg
