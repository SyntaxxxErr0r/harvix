1.60	SpiderOak	SpiderOak	SpiderOak is an online backup tool for Windows, Mac and Linux users to back up, share, sync, access and store their data using an off-site server. SpiderOak allows the user to back up any given folder of his/her computer. SpiderOak uses encrypted cloud storage and client-side encryption key creation, so even employees of SpiderOak cannot access users' information (this is the 'zero-knowledge' data encryption, which is invalidated if you access the service through their website or a mobile device). However, that can't be assured due to its client's closed source nature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9d/Spideroakrgb.png/128px-Spideroakrgb.png
