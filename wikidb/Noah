71.5	Noah	Noah	Noah (or Noé, Noach; Hebrew: , Modern Tiberian ; Arabic: نُوح ; Greek: Νῶε) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the tenth and last of the antediluvian Patriarchs. The biblical story of Noah is contained in chapters 6–9 of the book of Genesis, where he saves his family (his wife, three sons, and their wives) and representatives of all animals from the flood by constructing an ark. He is also mentioned as the "first husbandman" and in the story of the Curse of Ham. Noah is the subject of much elaboration in later Abrahamic traditions. Noah is also mentioned several times in the Qur'an.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/NoahsSacrifice.JPG/250px-NoahsSacrifice.JPG
