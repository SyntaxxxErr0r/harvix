196.8	Peru	Peru	Peruvian territory was home to ancient cultures, spanning from the Norte Chico civilization, one of the oldest in the world, to the Inca Empire, the largest state in Pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a Viceroyalty, which included most of its South American colonies. After achieving independence in 1821, Peru has undergone periods of political unrest and fiscal crisis as well as periods of stability and economic upswing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Peru.svg/125px-Flag_of_Peru.svg.png
