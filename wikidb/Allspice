60.1	Allspice	Allspice	Allspice, also called Jamaica pepper, pepper, myrtle pepper, pimenta, or newspice, is a spice that is the dried unripe fruit ("berries") of Pimenta dioica, a mid-canopy tree native to the Greater Antilles, southern Mexico, and Central America, now cultivated in many warm parts of the world. The name allspice was coined as early as 1621 by the English, who thought it combined the flavour of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Pimenta_dioica_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-239.jpg/220px-Pimenta_dioica_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-239.jpg
