189.5	White_House	White House	The White House is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of the United States. Located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., the house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban, and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted Aquia sandstone in the Neoclassical style. It has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) expanded the building outward, creating two colonnades that were meant to conceal stables and storage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/WhiteHouseSouthFacade.JPG/220px-WhiteHouseSouthFacade.JPG
