2.10	Graph_cycle	Cycle (graph theory)	In graph theory, the term cycle may refer to a closed path. If repeated vertices are allowed, it is more often called a closed walk. If the path is a simple path, with no repeated vertices or edges other than the starting and ending vertices, it may also be called a simple cycle, circuit, circle, or polygon; see Cycle graph. A cycle in a directed graph is called a directed cycle.
