60.2	New_Horizons	New Horizons	New Horizons is a NASA robotic spacecraft mission currently en route to the dwarf planet Pluto. It is expected to be the first spacecraft to fly by and study Pluto and its moons, Charon, Nix, Hydra and S/2011 P 1. Its estimated arrival date at the Pluto-Charon system is July 14, 2015. NASA may then also attempt flybys of one or more other Kuiper belt objects if a suitable one can be located.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/New_horizons_Pluto.jpg/290px-New_horizons_Pluto.jpg
