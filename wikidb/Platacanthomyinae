2.01	Platacanthomyinae	Platacanthomyidae	The rodent family Platacanthomyidae, or Oriental dormice, includes the spiny dormice and the Chinese pygmy dormice. In spite of their appearance, these animals are not true dormice, but are part of the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. The platacanthomyids can be distinguished from the true dormice, because they have no premolars, giving them three cheek teeth, like their relatives, the Muroidea.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Malabar_spiny_dormouse.jpg/220px-Malabar_spiny_dormouse.jpg
