59.3	William_Bligh	William Bligh	Vice Admiral William Bligh FRS RN (9 September 1754 â€“ 7 December 1817) was an officer of the British Royal Navy and a colonial administrator. A notorious mutiny occurred during his command of HMAV Bounty in 1789; Bligh and his loyal men made a remarkable voyage to Timor, after being set adrift in the Bounty's launch by the mutineers. Fifteen years after the Bounty mutiny, he was appointed Governor of New South Wales in Australia, with orders to clean up the corrupt rum trade of the New South Wales Corps, resulting in the so-called Rum Rebellion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/WilliamBligh.jpeg
