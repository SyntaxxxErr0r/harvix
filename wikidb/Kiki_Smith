51.2	Kiki_Smith	Kiki Smith	Kiki Smith (born January 18, 1954, in Nuremberg, Germany) is an American artist classified as a feminist artist, a movement with beginnings in the 20th century. Her Body Art is imbued with political significance, undermining the traditional erotic representations of women by male artists, and often exposes the inner biological systems of females as a metaphor for hidden social issues. Her work also often includes the themes of birth and regeneration, as well as sustenance, and frequently has Catholic allusions. Smith has also been active in debate over controversies such as AIDS, gender, race, and battered women.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Time_100_Kiki_Smith_a.jpg/250px-Time_100_Kiki_Smith_a.jpg
