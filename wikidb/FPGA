76.9	FPGA	Field-programmable gate array	A field-programmable gate array is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by the customer or designer after manufacturingâ€”hence "field-programmable". The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) (circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs, but this is increasingly rare). FPGAs can be used to implement any logical function that an ASIC could perform. The ability to update the functionality after shipping, partial re-configuration of a portion of the design and the low non-recurring engineering costs relative to an ASIC design (notwithstanding the generally higher unit cost), offer advantages for many applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Altera_StratixIVGX_FPGA.jpg/300px-Altera_StratixIVGX_FPGA.jpg
