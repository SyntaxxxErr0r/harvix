62.9	Dessert	Dessert	In cultures around the world, dessert or pudding is a course that typically comes at the end of a meal, usually consisting of sweet food. The word comes from the French language as dessert and this from Old French desservir, "to clear the table" and "to serve." The etymology is linked to the medieval practice of a two part meal. During the first nobles (at a high) and servants (separate) would eat together in the same room. During the second - dessert, the noble family would retreat in separate private quarters for an intimate part of the meal without servants. The food consumed during dessert included but was not limited to sweets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Floris_Claesz._van_Dyck_001.jpg/180px-Floris_Claesz._van_Dyck_001.jpg
