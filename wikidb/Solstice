170.3	Solstice	Solstice	A solstice is an astronomical event that happens twice each year when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky as seen from the North or South Pole. The word solstice is derived from the Latin sol (sun) and sistere (to stand still), because at the solstices, the Sun stands still in declination; that is, the seasonal movement of the Sun's path (as seen from Earth) comes to a stop before reversing direction. The solstices, together with the equinoxes, are connected with the seasons. In many cultures the solstices mark either the beginning or the midpoint of winter and summer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Solargraph_APEX.tif/lossy-page1-220px-Solargraph_APEX.tif.jpg
