95.1	Holography	Holography	Holography (from the Greek ὅλος hólos, "whole" + γραφή grafē, "writing, drawing") is a technique that allows the light scattered from an object to be recorded and later reconstructed so that when an imaging system (a camera or an eye) is placed in the reconstructed beam, an image of the object will be seen even when the object is no longer present. The image changes as the position and orientation of the viewing system changes in exactly the same way as if the object were still present, thus making the image appear three-dimensional.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Holomouse2.jpg/253px-Holomouse2.jpg
