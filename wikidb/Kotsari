2.00	Kotsari	Kochari	Armenians have been dancing Kochari for over a thousand years. The dance is danced to a 2/4 rhythm. Dancers form a closed circle, putting their hands on each other's shoulders. This may symbolize the alienation that this minority community felt at the time of the dance's birth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/A_part_of_Kochari_dance_sheet_music.svg/400px-A_part_of_Kochari_dance_sheet_music.svg.png
