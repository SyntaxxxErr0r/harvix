3.00	Dream_of_Light	Dream of Light	Dream of Light is a 1992 Spanish film directed by Victor Erice. Its Spanish title is El Sol del Membrillo, which translates directly to the English "The Sun of the Quince"; it was released in Hong Kong as The Sun of the Quince Tree, and internationally as Quince Tree of the Sun. The film centers on Spanish painter Antonio López García (playing himself) and his attempt to paint the eponymous quince tree. López struggles to capture a perfect, fleeting moment of beauty on canvas, and the film meticulously chronicles his work.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/El_sol_del_membrillo.jpg/220px-El_sol_del_membrillo.jpg
