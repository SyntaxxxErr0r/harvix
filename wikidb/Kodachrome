88.1	Kodachrome	Kodachrome	Kodachrome is a type of color reversal film introduced by Eastman Kodak in 1935. It was one of the first successful color materials and was used for both cinematography and stills photography. Because of its complex processing requirements, the film was sold process-paid until 1954 in the United States where a legal ruling prohibited this. Elsewhere, this arrangement continued. Kodachrome was the subject of a Paul Simon song and a US state park was named after it. For many years it was used for professional color photography, especially for images intended for publication in print media. Because of the uptake of alternative photographic materials, its complex processing and the widespread transition to digital photography, Kodachrome lost its market share, its manufacture was discontinued in 2009 and film processing ended in 2010.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Kodachrome_box.JPG/200px-Kodachrome_box.JPG
