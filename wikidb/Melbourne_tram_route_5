It runs from the University of Melbourne north of the city centre to Malvern East in the eastern suburbs. The destination is, however, displayed as Malvern, although the route technically ends within Malvern East. This is to avoid confusion with route 3 which also terminates in Malvern East.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/MelbourneTramInfoboxSign-bottomonly.gif
