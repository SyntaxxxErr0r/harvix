71.0	Von_Neumann_architecture	Von Neumann architecture	Through the decades of the 1960s and 1970s computers generally became both smaller and faster, which led to some evolutions in their architecture. For example, memory-mapped I/O allows input and output devices to be treated the same as memory. A single system bus could be used to provide a modular system with lower cost. This is sometimes called a "streamlining" of the architecture. In subsequent decades, simple microcontrollers would sometimes omit features of the model to lower cost and size. Larger computers added features for higher performance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Computer_system_bus.svg/220px-Computer_system_bus.svg.png
