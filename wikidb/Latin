353.9	Latin	Latin	Latin (Latin: , IPA: ) is an Italic language originally spoken in Latium and Ancient Rome. It, along with most European languages, is a descendant of the ancient Proto-Indo-European language. It originated in the Italian peninsula. Although it is considered a dead language, many scholars and members of the Christian clergy speak it fluently, and it is widely taught in secondary and post-secondary, and also in primary educational institutions. Latin is still used in the creation of new words in modern languages of many different families, including English, and in biological taxonomy. Latin and its daughter Romance languages are the only surviving languages of the Italic language family. Other languages of the Italic branch are attested in inscriptions surviving from early Italy, but were assimilated during the Roman Republic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Rome_Colosseum_inscription_2.jpg/200px-Rome_Colosseum_inscription_2.jpg
