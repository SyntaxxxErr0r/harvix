83.5	KVM_switch	KVM switch	A KVM switch (with KVM being an abbreviation for keyboard, video, or visual display unit, mouse) is a hardware device that allows a user to control multiple computers from a single keyboard, video monitor and mouse. Although multiple computers are connected to the KVM, typically a smaller number of computers can be controlled at any given time. Modern devices have also added the ability to share USB devices and speakers with multiple computers. Some KVM switches can also function in reverse - that is, a single PC can be connected to multiple monitors, keyboards, and mice. While not as common as the former, this configuration is useful when the operator wants to access a single computer from two or more (usually close) locations - for example, a public kiosk machine that also has a staff maintenance interface behind the counter, or a home office computer that doubles as a home theater PC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Kvm-switch-diagram.svg/220px-Kvm-switch-diagram.svg.png
