157.3	U.S._state	U.S. state	A U.S. state is a federated state of the United States of America that shares sovereignty with the United States federal government. Since the admission of Hawaii as a state in August 1959, there are fifty U.S. states. Because of the shared sovereignty between a U.S. state and the U.S. federal government, an American is a citizen of both the federal entity and of his or her state of domicile. Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia use the official title of Commonwealth rather than State. State citizenship is flexible and no government approval is required to move between states, with the exception of former convicts on parole.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Blank_US_Map.svg/275px-Blank_US_Map.svg.png
