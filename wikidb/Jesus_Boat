1.70	Jesus_Boat	Sea of Galilee Boat	The Sea of Galilee Boat also known as the "Jesus Boat" was an ancient fishing boat from the 1st century CE (the time of Jesus Christ), discovered in 1986 on the north-west shore of the Sea of Galilee in Israel. The remains of the boat, 27 feet (8.27 meters) long, 7.5 feet (2.3 meters) wide and with a maximum preserved height of 4.3 feet (1.3 meters), first appeared during a drought, when the waters of the Sea (actually a great fresh-water lake) receded. There is no evidence connecting the boat to Jesus or his disciples.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Ginosar_BW_7.jpg/250px-Ginosar_BW_7.jpg
