79.3	Computational_complexity_theory	Computational complexity theory	Decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language, where the members of the language are instances whose answer is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an algorithm, whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes, the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/TSP_Deutschland_3.png/200px-TSP_Deutschland_3.png
