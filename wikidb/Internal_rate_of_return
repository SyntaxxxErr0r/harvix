59.4	Internal_rate_of_return	Internal rate of return	The internal rate of return is a rate of return used in capital budgeting to measure and compare the profitability of investments. It is also called the discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) or the rate of return (ROR). In the context of savings and loans the IRR is also called the effective interest rate. The term internal refers to the fact that its calculation does not incorporate environmental factors (e.g., the interest rate or inflation).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/IRR1_-_Grieger.jpg/220px-IRR1_-_Grieger.jpg
