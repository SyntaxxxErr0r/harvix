1.01	Type_051C_destroyer	Type 051C destroyer	The Type 051C or Luzhou class destroyer is a long-range air-defence guided missile destroyer built by China in its ongoing effort to create a true blue water navy. The ship uses the hull design of the older Type 051B (Luhai class), but is equipped with the advanced Russian S-300FM air defence missiles systems. Currently, two ships of this class have been launched and deployed by People's Liberation Army Navy North Sea Fleet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/US_Navy_090423-N-1251W-103_Sailors_assigned_to_the_guided-missile_destroyer_USS_Fitzgerald_%28DDG_62%29_man_the_rails_and_render_honors_to_the_People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy.jpg/320px-US_Navy_090423-N-1251W-103_Sailors_assigned_to_the_guided-missile_destroyer_USS_Fitzgerald_%28DDG_62%29_man_the_rails_and_render_honors_to_the_People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy.jpg
