243.2	Neuro-linguistic_programming	Neuro-linguistic programming	Neuro-linguistic programming is an approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created in the 1970s. The title refers to a stated connection between the neurological processes ("neuro"), language ("linguistic") and behavioral patterns that have been learned through experience ("programming") and can be organized to achieve specific goals in life. According to certain neuroscientists, psychologists and linguists, NLP is unsupported by current scientific evidence, and uses incorrect and misleading terms and concepts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Mouvements-oculaires-PNL.jpg/250px-Mouvements-oculaires-PNL.jpg
