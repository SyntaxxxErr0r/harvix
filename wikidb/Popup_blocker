3.10	Popup_blocker	Pop-up ad	Pop-up ads or pop-ups are a form of online advertising on the World Wide Web intended to attract web traffic or capture email addresses. Pop-ups are generally new web browser windows to display advertisements. The pop-up window containing an advertisement is usually generated by JavaScript using cross-site scripting (XSS), sometimes with a secondary payload using Adobe Flash, but can also be generated by other vulnerabilities/security holes in browser security.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/Pop-up_ads.jpg/325px-Pop-up_ads.jpg
