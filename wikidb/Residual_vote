1.00	Residual_vote	Spoilt vote	In voting, a ballot is considered to be spoilt, spoiled, void, null, informal or stray if it is regarded by the election authorities to be invalid and thus not included in the tally during vote counting. This may be done accidentally or deliberately. The total number of spoilt votes in a United States election has been called the residual vote.
