77.2	Shakti	Shakti	Shakti from Sanskrit shak - "to be able," meaning sacred force or empowerment, is the primordial cosmic energy and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire universe in Hinduism. Shakti is the concept, or personification, of divine feminine creative power, sometimes referred to as 'The Great Divine Mother' in Hinduism. On the earthly plane, Shakti most actively manifests through female embodiment and creativity/fertility, though it is also present in males in its potential, unmanifest form.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Manasa_Devi.jpg/220px-Manasa_Devi.jpg
