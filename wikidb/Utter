2.00	Utter	Utterance	In spoken language analysis an utterance is a smallest unit of speech. It is generally but not always bounded by silence. It can be represented and delineated in written language in many ways. Note that in such areas of research utterances do not exist in written language, only their representations do. In other fields it is medium-neutral and refers to any use of language in context (in contrast with the abstract form sentence).
