4.10	I_Hate_Myself_and_Want_to_Die	In Utero (album)	In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American grunge band Nirvana, released on September 13, 1993, on DGC Records. Nirvana intended the record to diverge significantly from the polished production of its previous album, Nevermind (1991). To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired producer Steve Albini to record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The music was recorded quickly with few studio embellishments, and the song lyrics and album packaging incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e5/In_Utero_%28Nirvana%29_album_cover.jpg/220px-In_Utero_%28Nirvana%29_album_cover.jpg
