2.00	Little_Office	Little Office of Our Lady	The Little Office of Our Lady also known as Hours of the Virgin is a liturgical devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, in imitation of, and usually in addition to, the Divine Office in the Roman Catholic Church (Some secular orders did use the Little Office on its own as their official form of prayer). It is a weekly cycle of psalms, hymns, scripture and other readings.
