125.7	Building_Information_Modeling	Building information modeling	Building information modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility. The resulting building information model becomes a shared knowledge resource to support decision-making about a facility from earliest conceptual stages, through design and construction, then through its operational life before its eventual demolition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/CustService_630X440.jpg/220px-CustService_630X440.jpg
