4.00	Moacyr_Barbosa	Moacir Barbosa Nascimento	Moacir Barbosa Nascimento (27 March 1921 â€“ 8 April 2000) was a Brazilian international football goalkeeper whose career spanned 22 years. He was one of the world's best goalkeepers in the 1940s and 1950s and known for not wearing gloves because he wanted to feel the ball with his bare hands. Although he won many trophies, his fame is mainly associated with the defeat of Brazil in the decisive match of the World Cup 1950 against Uruguay. He died of a heart attack at age 79, almost penniless.
