10.21	Silent_Coup	Silent Coup	Silent Coup is a 1992 book written by Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin in which they contend that former Nixon White House counsel John Dean orchestrated the 1972 Watergate burglary at Democratic National Committee headquarters to protect his future wife, Maureen Biner, by removing information linking her to a call-girl ring that worked for the DNC. The authors also argued that Alexander Haig was not Deep Throat but was a key source for Bob Woodward, who as a Naval officer had briefed Haig at the White House in 1969 and 1970.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/Silent_Coup.png/220px-Silent_Coup.png
