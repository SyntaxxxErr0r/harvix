1.00	Stone_of_Remembrance	Stone of Remembrance	The Stone of Remembrance was designed by the British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens for the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC). It was designed to commemorate the dead of World War I, to be used in IWGC war cemeteries containing 1000 or more graves, or at memorial sites commemorating more than 1000 war dead. Hundreds were erected following World War I, and it has since been used in cemeteries containing the Commonwealth dead of World War II as well. It is intended to commemorate those "of all faiths and none", and has been described as one of Lutyens' "most important and powerful works", with a "brooding, sentinel-like presence wherever used".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/CWGC_-_Stone_of_Remembrance.jpg/200px-CWGC_-_Stone_of_Remembrance.jpg
