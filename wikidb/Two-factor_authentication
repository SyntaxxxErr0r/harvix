The number is derived from the shared secret by a cryptographic process which makes it infeasible to work out the secret from the sequence of numbers. Essentially, the secret is hashed or otherwise cryptographically combined with a challenge, and the result is displayed. The same process repeated on the authentication server will yield the same result if the correct secret was used. The challenge can take one of three forms:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/SecureID_token_new.JPG/220px-SecureID_token_new.JPG
