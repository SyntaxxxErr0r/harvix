160.2	Spreadsheet	Spreadsheet	A modern spreadsheet file consists of multiple worksheets (usually called by the shorter name sheets) that make up one workbook, with each file being one workbook. A cell on one sheet is capable of referencing cells on other, different sheets, whether within the same workbook or even, in some cases, in different workbooks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/Excel_2010.png/420px-Excel_2010.png
