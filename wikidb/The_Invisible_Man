Originally serialised in Pearson's Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it absorbs and reflects no light and thus becomes invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but fails in his attempt to reverse the procedure. Instead, his plight becomes known. When he attempts to enlist the aid of former acquaintance, he is betrayed. So Griffin decides to murder his betrayer and begin a "Reign of Terror".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/Invisibleman1stedition.jpg/240px-Invisibleman1stedition.jpg
