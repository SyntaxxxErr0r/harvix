13.41	Waldi	Waldi	Waldi was the first official Olympic mascot. Created for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, he was a dachshund, a popular breed of dog from Germany. Waldi was designed by Otl Aicher and modeled on a real dog, a long-haired Dachshund named Cherie von Birkenhof. Waldi's head and tail were blue and his body was stripes of most of the other Olympic colors, excluding those colors related to the National Socialist's Party. The course of the marathon was designed to incorporate the Waldi design, and during the construction phase of the 1972 Olympic stadium and village, Waldi was used in unofficial satirical posters.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b0/Waldi%2C_Olympic_logo_1972.png/220px-Waldi%2C_Olympic_logo_1972.png
