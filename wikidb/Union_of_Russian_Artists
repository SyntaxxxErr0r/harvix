1.00	Union_of_Russian_Artists	Mir iskusstva	Mir iskusstva was a Russian magazine and the artistic movement it inspired and embodied, which was a major influence on the Russians who helped revolutionize European art during the first decade of the 20th century. From 1909, many of the miriskusniki (i.e., members of the movement) also contributed to the Ballets Russes company operating in Paris. Few Western Europeans actually saw issues of the magazine itself.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Kustodiyev_world_of_the_art.JPG/300px-Kustodiyev_world_of_the_art.JPG
