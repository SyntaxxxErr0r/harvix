1.00	Amundsen_Crater	Amundsen (crater)	Amundsen is a large lunar impact crater located near the south pole of the Moon, named after the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. It lies along the southern lunar limb, and so is viewed from the side by an observer on the Earth. To the northwest is the crater Scott, a formation of similar dimensions that is named for another Antarctic explorer. Nobile is attached to the western rim.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Amundsen_crater_color_albedo.jpg/200px-Amundsen_crater_color_albedo.jpg
