222.4	Monty_Hall_problem	Monty Hall problem	The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after the show's original host, Monty Hall. The problem, also called the Monty Hall paradox, is a veridical paradox because the result appears odd but is demonstrably true. The Monty Hall problem, in its usual interpretation, is mathematically equivalent to the earlier Three Prisoners problem, and both bear some similarity to the much older Bertrand's box paradox.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Monty_open_door.svg/220px-Monty_open_door.svg.png
