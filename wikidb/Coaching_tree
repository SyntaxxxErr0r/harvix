20.31	Coaching_tree	Coaching tree	A coaching tree is similar to a family tree except it shows the relationships of coaches instead of family members. There are several different ways to define a relationship between two coaches. The most common way to make the distinction is if a coach worked as an assistant on a particular head coach's staff for at least a season then that coach can be counted as being a branch on the head coach's coaching tree. Coaching trees can also show philosophical influence from one head coach to an assistant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Walsh_Coaching_Tree3.png
