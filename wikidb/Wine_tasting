118.4	Wine_tasting	Wine tasting	Wine tasting (often, in wine circles, simply tasting) is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving formal terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/French_taste_of_wines.JPG/225px-French_taste_of_wines.JPG
