1.00	Savannah-Ogeechee_Canal	Savannah–Ogeechee Canal	The historic Savannah – Ogeechee Barge Canal is one of the prime relics in the history of southern canals. Beginning with the tidal lock at the Savannah River, the waterway continues through four lift locks as it traverses 16.5 miles (26.6 km), before reaching another tidal lock at the Ogeechee River at Fort Stewart. Along the way, the canal passed through Savannah’s 19th century industrial corridor, former rice fields, timber tracts, and a still lush tidal river swamp and adjacent sandhill environment that is the characteristic habitat for several unique species of flora and fauna. Nowadays much of this area comprises the Savannah suburbs of Garden City and Pooler. The canal was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 1997.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/GA_Savannah_Savannah%E2%80%93Ogeechee_Canal01.jpg/250px-GA_Savannah_Savannah%E2%80%93Ogeechee_Canal01.jpg
