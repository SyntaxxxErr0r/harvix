The sector is organized along provincial and territorial lines. In a majority of provinces, large government-owned integrated public utilities play a leading role in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Ontario and Alberta have created electricity markets in the last decade in order to increase investment and competition in this sector of the economy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Electricity_production_in_Canada.svg/300px-Electricity_production_in_Canada.svg.png
