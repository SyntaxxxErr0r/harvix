2.00	Now_My_Heart_Is_Full	Now My Heart Is Full	"Now My Heart Is Full" is a song by British artist Morrissey from his fourth solo album Vauxhall and I. Critics have suggested the song's refrain of "Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt" addresses the gangsters from Graham Greene's 1938 novel Brighton Rock and so has a thematic link with Morrissey's 1989 song about the Kray twins "The Last of the Famous International Playboys".
