62.9	Crucifixion_of_Jesus	Crucifixion of Jesus	The crucifixion of Jesus and his ensuing death is an event that occurred during the 1st century AD. Jesus, who Christians believe is the Son of God as well as the Messiah, was arrested, tried, and sentenced by Pontius Pilate to be scourged, and finally executed on a cross. Collectively referred to as the Passion, Jesus' redemptive suffering and death by crucifixion represent the central aspects of Christian theology, including the doctrines of salvation and atonement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/SVouet.jpg/240px-SVouet.jpg
