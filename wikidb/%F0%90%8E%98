1.00	%F0%90%8E%98	Ugaritic alphabet	The Ugaritic script is a cuneiform (wedge-shaped) abjad used from around either the fifteenth century BCE or 1300 BCE for Ugaritic, an extinct Northwest Semitic language, and discovered in Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra), Syria, in 1928. It has 30 letters. Other languages (particularly Hurrian) were occasionally written in the Ugaritic script in the area around Ugarit, although not elsewhere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/22_alphabet.jpg/200px-22_alphabet.jpg
