7.01	Herta_Heuwer	Herta Heuwer	Herta Charlotte Heuwer (June 30, 1913 in KÃ¶nigsberg - July 3, 1999 in Berlin) invented the take-out dish that would become the world-renowned currywurst on September 4, 1949. The day before what would have been her 90th birthday, a plaque was dedicated in her honour on the corner of Kant and Kaiser Friedrich Streets, Berlin where she first produced the dish. The original Currywurst was a boiled sausage, fried, with a sauce of tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, curry powder and other ingredients.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/786px-Curry_schild.jpg/220px-786px-Curry_schild.jpg
