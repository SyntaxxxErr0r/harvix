8.22	Sumo_(band)	Sumo (band)	Sumo was a 1980s Argentine alternative rock band, merging post-punk with reggae and ska. Headed by Italian-born Luca Prodan, it remained underground for most of its short activity, but was extremely influential in shaping contemporary Argentine rock. Sumo introduced British post-punk to the Argentine scene, with almost the whole lyrics in English. And provided a visceral counterpoint to the progressive and nueva canción influences then dominant in Rock en Español.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Sumo_1985.jpg/220px-Sumo_1985.jpg
