Because Democratic President Lyndon Johnson had announced he would not seek a second term, the purpose of the convention was to select a new nominee to run as the Democratic Partyâ€™s candidate for the office. The keynote speaker was Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/38_H_Humphrey_3x4.jpg/100px-38_H_Humphrey_3x4.jpg
