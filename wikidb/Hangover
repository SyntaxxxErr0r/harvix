The most commonly reported characteristics of a hangover include headache, nausea, sensitivity to light and noise, lethargy, dysphoria, diarrhea and thirst, typically after the intoxicating effect of the alcohol begins to wear off. While a hangover can be experienced at any time, generally speaking a hangover is experienced the morning after a night of heavy drinking. In addition to the physical symptoms, a hangover may also induce psychological symptoms including heightened feelings of depression and anxiety.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Portrait_de_Suzanne_Valadon_par_Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec.jpg/230px-Portrait_de_Suzanne_Valadon_par_Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec.jpg
