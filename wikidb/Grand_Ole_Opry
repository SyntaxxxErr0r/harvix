It is also among the longest-running broadcasts in history since its beginnings as a one-hour radio "barn dance" on WSM-AM. Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of legends and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits. Considered an American icon, it attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and internet listeners. The Opry, today part of the American landscape, is "the show that made country music famous" and has been called the "home of American music" and "countryâ€™s most famous stage."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Grand_Ole_Opry_Logo_2005.png/180px-Grand_Ole_Opry_Logo_2005.png
