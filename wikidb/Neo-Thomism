2.20	Neo-Thomism	Neo-Scholasticism	Neo-Scholasticism is the revival and development of medieval scholastic philosophy starting from the second half of the 19th century. It has some times been called neo-Thomism partly because Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century gave to scholasticism a final form, partly because the idea gained ground that only Thomism could infuse vitality into 12th century scholasticism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Benozzo_Gozzoli_004a.jpg/100px-Benozzo_Gozzoli_004a.jpg
