52.4	John_cage	John Cage	John Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 â€“ August 12, 1992) was an American composer, music theorist, writer, philosopher and artist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential American composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/John_Cage_Laugh.png/220px-John_Cage_Laugh.png
