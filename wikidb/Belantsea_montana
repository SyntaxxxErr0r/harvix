1.00	Belantsea_montana	Belantsea	Belantsea montana (named after a legendary ancestor of the Crow Nation) was a cartilaginous fish that lived during the Lower Carboniferous, about 350 million years ago. Its fossils are found in the Bear Gulch Limestone lagerst√§tte. Its body was leaf-shaped, with muscular fins and a small tail. Such a bodyplan would allow for great maneuverability, but at the cost of speedy cruising. Its few, large, triangular teeth formed a beak-like arrangement that allowed it to graze bryozoans, sponges, crinoids and other encrusting animals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Belantsea_montana.JPG/220px-Belantsea_montana.JPG
