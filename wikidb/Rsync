249.5	Rsync	rsync	rsync is a software application and network protocol for Unix-like and Windows systems that synchronizes files and directories from one location to another while minimizing data transfer using delta encoding when appropriate. An important feature of rsync not found in most similar programs/protocols is that the mirroring takes place with only one transmission in each direction. rsync can copy or display directory contents and copy files, optionally using compression and recursion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/Newrsynclogo.png/160px-Newrsynclogo.png
