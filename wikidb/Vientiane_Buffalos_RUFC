The club has grown gradually since then and is a full member of the Lao Rugby Federation (LRF). As well as men's contact rugby (sevens, tens and fifteen-a-side), the club organises touch rugby tournaments involving women and children. Members of the Buffalos have been instrumental in promoting the sport in Laos, setting up the LRF and establishing a Lao national team and other clubs to play against.
