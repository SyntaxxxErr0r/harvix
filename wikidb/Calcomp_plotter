4.00	Calcomp_plotter	Calcomp plotter	The Calcomp 560 drum plotter, introduced in 1959, was one of the first computer graphics output devices sold. The computer could control in 0.01 inch increments the rotation of an 11 inch (280 mm) wide drum and the horizontal movement of a pen holder over the drum. A solenoid could press the pen against paper scrolling across the drum. This arrangement allowed line drawings to be made under computer control. A version with a wider drum was also available.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Calcomp_565_drum_plotter.jpg/220px-Calcomp_565_drum_plotter.jpg
