88.7	Bayesian_network	Bayesian network	A Bayesian network, Bayes network, belief network, hierarchical Bayes(ian) model or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model (a type of statistical model) that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Hierarchical_model.PNG/220px-Hierarchical_model.PNG
