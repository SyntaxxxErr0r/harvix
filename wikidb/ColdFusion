74.9	ColdFusion	ColdFusion	In computing, ColdFusion is the name of a commercial rapid application development platform invented by Jeremy and JJ Allaire in 1995. (The programming language used with that platform is also commonly called ColdFusion, though is more accurately known as CFML.) ColdFusion was originally designed to make it easier to connect simple HTML pages to a database, by version 2 (1996) it had become a full platform that included an IDE in addition to a "full" scripting language. As of 2010 , versions of ColdFusion (purchased by Adobe Systems in 2005) include advanced features for enterprise integration and development of rich Internet applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Adobe_HQ.jpg/200px-Adobe_HQ.jpg
