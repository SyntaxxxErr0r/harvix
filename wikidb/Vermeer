57.7	Vermeer	Johannes Vermeer	Johannes, Jan or Johan Vermeer (Dutch pronunciation: ;1632 â€“ December 1675) was a Dutch painter who specialized in exquisite, domestic interior scenes of middle class life. Vermeer was a moderately successful provincial genre painter in his lifetime. He seems never to have been particularly wealthy, leaving his wife and children in debt at his death, perhaps because he produced relatively few paintings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_002.jpg/245px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_002.jpg
