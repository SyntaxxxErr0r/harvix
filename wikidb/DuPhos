1.00	DuPhos	DuPhos	DuPhos is a class of asymmetric ligands for asymmetric synthesis. The name DuPhos is derived from the chemical company that developed this type of ligand (DuP, DuPont) and the compound class of phospholanes (Phos) it belongs to. This diphosphine ligand type was introduced in 1991 by M.J. Burk and first demonstrated in asymmetric hydrogenation of certain enamide esters to amino acid precursors:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/DuPhos_ligands.svg/221px-DuPhos_ligands.svg.png
