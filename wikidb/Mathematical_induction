53.5	Mathematical_induction	Mathematical induction	Mathematical induction is a method of mathematical proof typically used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers (positive integers). It is done by proving that the first statement in the infinite sequence of statements is true, and then proving that if any one statement in the infinite sequence of statements is true, then so is the next one.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Dominoeffect.png/220px-Dominoeffect.png
