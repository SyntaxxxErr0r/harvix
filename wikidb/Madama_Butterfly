57.1	Madama_Butterfly	Madama Butterfly	Madama Butterfly is an opera in three acts (originally two acts) by Giacomo Puccini, with an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. The libretto of the opera is based in part on the short story "Madame Butterfly" (1898) by John Luther Long, which was dramatized by David Belasco. Elements also appear to derive from the novel Madame Chrysanth√®me (1887) by Pierre Loti. According to one scholar, the story of the opera was based on events that actually occurred in Nagasaki in the early 1890s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Puccini6.jpg/220px-Puccini6.jpg
