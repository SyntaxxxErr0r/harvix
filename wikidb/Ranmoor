2.00	Ranmoor	Ranmoor	Ranmoor (grid reference ) is a suburb of the City of Sheffield, England. It is an affluent suburb in the Fulwood ward of the city. It mostly developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and it features a number of large houses that were built for the city's steel magnates, as well as, most notably, a large church, St John's. This church was opened 24 April 1879 but was almost entirely destroyed by fire on 2 January 1887. All that survived from the original church was the tower and spire, which still stands today. A new building was built and the church reopened on 9 September 1888; it is now a Grade II* listed building. A row of early 19th century buildings near the church includes the Bull's Head and Ranmoor Inn public houses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Sheffield_outline_map_with_UK.svg/240px-Sheffield_outline_map_with_UK.svg.png
