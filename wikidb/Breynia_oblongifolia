1.00	Breynia_oblongifolia	Breynia oblongifolia	Breynia oblongifolia, commonly known as coffee bush, is an Australasian shrub growing to 3 m in height. The species produces alternate, ovate leaves 20â€“30 mm long. Small, green flowers are produced in spring and summer, and these are followed by followed by orange or pink berries ~6 mm diameter that turn black when fully ripe. This native shrub is easily confused with the introduced Senna sp. species which prefer similar habitats and are commonly seen together in urban bushland areas the best way to distinguish the two is that Breynia oblongifolia has alternate leaves (spaced along intervals on stem) and Senna sp. has leaves opposite (leaves facing each other in pair, or technically leaflets), Senna sp. is also covered in a mass of butter yellow flowers followed by leguminous pods whislt Breynia has berries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Breynia_oblongifolia_foliage.jpg/220px-Breynia_oblongifolia_foliage.jpg
