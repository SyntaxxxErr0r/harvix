55.7	Rudolf_Hess	Rudolf Hess	Rudolf Walter Richard Hess (26 April 1894 â€“ 17 August 1987) was a prominent Nazi politician who was Adolf Hitler's deputy in the Nazi Party during the 1930s and early 1940s. On the eve of war with the Soviet Union, he flew solo to Scotland in an attempt to negotiate peace with the United Kingdom, but was arrested and became a prisoner of war. Hess was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he served at Spandau Prison, Berlin, where he died in 1987. There have been conspiracy theories linked to Hess. After World War II Winston Churchill wrote of Hess, "He was a medical and not a criminal case, and should be so regarded."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146II-849%2C_Rudolf_He%C3%9F.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_146II-849%2C_Rudolf_He%C3%9F.jpg
