149.5	OPML	OPML	OPML is an XML format for outlines (defined as "a tree, where each node contains a set of named attributes with string values"). Originally developed by Radio UserLand as a native file format for an outliner application, it has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of web feeds between web feed aggregators.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Opml-icon.svg/100px-Opml-icon.svg.png
