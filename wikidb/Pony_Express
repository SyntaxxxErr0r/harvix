76.6	Pony_Express	Pony Express	The Pony Express was a fast mail service crossing the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, and the High Sierra from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California, from April 3, 1860 to October 1861. It became the west's most direct means of east-west communication before the telegraph and was vital for tying California closely with the Union just before the American Civil War.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Pony_Express_Poster.jpg/220px-Pony_Express_Poster.jpg
