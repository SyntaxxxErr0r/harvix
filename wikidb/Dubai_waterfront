The project is a conglomeration of canals and artificial archipelago; it would occupy the last remaining Persian Gulf coastline of Dubai, the most populous emirate of the United Arab Emirates. It was planned to consist of a series of zones with mixed use including commercial, residential, resort, and amenity areas. The vision of the project is "to create a world-class destination for residents, visitors and businesses in the world's fastest growing city".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Dubaiwaterfront_en.jpg/220px-Dubaiwaterfront_en.jpg
