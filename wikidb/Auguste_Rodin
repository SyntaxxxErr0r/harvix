107.8	Auguste_Rodin	Auguste Rodin	François-Auguste-René Rodin (12 November 1840 – 17 November 1917), known as Auguste Rodin (French: ), was a French sculptor. Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition, although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Rodin-cropped.png/250px-Rodin-cropped.png
