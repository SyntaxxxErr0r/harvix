66.8	Vegetable_oil	Vegetable fats and oils	Vegetable fats and oils are lipid materials derived from plants. Physically, oils are liquid at room temperature, and fats are solid. Chemically, both fats and oils are composed of triglycerides, as contrasted with waxes which lack glycerin in their structure. Although many plant parts may yield oil, in commercial practice, oil is extracted primarily from seeds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Olive_oil_from_Oneglia.jpg/145px-Olive_oil_from_Oneglia.jpg
