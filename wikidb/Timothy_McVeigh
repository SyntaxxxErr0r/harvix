163.8	Timothy_McVeigh	Timothy McVeigh	Timothy James McVeigh (April 23, 1968 â€“ June 11, 2001) was a United States Army veteran and security guard who detonated a truck bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. Commonly referred to as the Oklahoma City Bombing, the attack killed 168 people and injured over 800 people, and was the deadliest act of terrorism within the United States prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks. McVeigh, a militia movement sympathizer, sought revenge against the federal government for its handling of the Waco Siege, which had ended in the deaths of 76 people exactly two years prior to the bombing, as well as for the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992. McVeigh hoped to inspire a revolt against what he considered to be a tyrannical federal government. He was convicted of 11 federal offenses and sentenced to death. His execution took place on June 11, 2001 at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier were also convicted as conspirators in the plot.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/TimothyMcVeighPerryOKApr2195.jpg/220px-TimothyMcVeighPerryOKApr2195.jpg
