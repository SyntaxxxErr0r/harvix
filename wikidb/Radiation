104.5	Radiation	Radiation	In physics, radiation is a process in which energetic particles or energetic waves travel through a medium or space. Two types of radiation are commonly differentiated in the way they interact with normal chemical matter: ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. The word radiation is often colloquially used in reference to ionizing radiation (i.e., radiation having sufficient energy to ionize an atom), but the term radiation may correctly also refer to non-ionizing radiation (e.g., radio waves, heat or visible light). The particles or waves radiate (i.e., travel outward in all directions) from a source. This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Alfa_beta_gamma_radiation_penetration.svg/300px-Alfa_beta_gamma_radiation_penetration.svg.png
