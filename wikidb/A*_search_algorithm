93.8	A*_search_algorithm	A* search algorithm	As A* traverses the graph, it follows a path of the lowest known cost, keeping a sorted priority queue of alternate path segments along the way. If, at any point, a segment of the path being traversed has a higher cost than another encountered path segment, it abandons the higher-cost path segment and traverses the lower-cost path segment instead. This process continues until the goal is reached.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Astar_progress_animation.gif
