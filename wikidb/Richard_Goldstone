51.4	Richard_Goldstone	Richard Goldstone	Richard Joseph Goldstone (born October 26, 1938) is a South African former judge. After working for 17 years as a commercial lawyer, he was appointed by the South African government to serve on the Transvaal Supreme Court from 1980 to 1989 and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa from 1990 to 1994. He was one of several liberal judges who issued key rulings that undermined apartheid from within the system by tempering the worst effects of the country's racial laws. Among other important rulings, Goldstone made the Group Areas Act – under which non-whites were banned from living in "whites only" areas – virtually unworkable by restricting evictions. As a result, prosecutions under the act virtually ceased.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/P1010796.JPG/220px-P1010796.JPG
