1.00	Archer_Avenue,_Chicago	Archer Avenue	Archer Avenue, sometimes known as Archer Road outside the Chicago, Illinois city limits, is a diagonal thoroughfare running northeast-to-southwest between Chicago's Chinatown and Lockport, Illinois. Archer follows the original trail crossing the Chicago Portage between the Chicago River and the Des Plaines River, and parallels the path of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Alton Railroad. As a main traffic artery, it has largely been replaced by the modern Stevenson Expressway.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Resurrection_Cemetery_Justice_IL_1.jpg/500px-Resurrection_Cemetery_Justice_IL_1.jpg
