1.00	Lung_Leg_(band)	Lungleg	LungLeg were an indie band from Glasgow, formed in 1994, and disbanded in 1999. They were known for a sparsely recorded stop-start kind of music influenced by C86 and riot grrrl as much as by post-punk bands such as The Fall, Kleenex/LiLiPUT and The Fire Engines. Singer Jane McKeown is the sister of John McKeown from The Yummy Fur and the two bands often toured together and even sometimes sounded similar.
