63.7	Israeli_settlement	Israeli settlement	An Israeli settlement is a Jewish civilian community built on land that was captured by Israel from Jordan, Egypt or Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War. Such settlements currently exist in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and in the Golan Heights. Settlements also existed in the Sinai and Gaza Strip until Israel evacuated the Sinai settlements following the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace agreement and unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip in 2005. Israel dismantled 18 settlements in the Sinai Peninsula in 1982, and all 21 in the Gaza Strip and 4 in the West Bank in 2005. Though the Oslo Accords barred both Israeli and Palestinians from undertaking unilateral actions that would alter the status quo, Israel continues to both expand its settlements and settle new areas in the West Bank. In March 2012, it was revealed that the Civil Administration, a unit of the IDF, has over the years covertly earmarked 10% of the West Bank for further settlement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/MaaleAdummim_red-roof.JPG/260px-MaaleAdummim_red-roof.JPG
