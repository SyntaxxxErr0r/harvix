3.10	Medicine_bag	Medicine bag	A medicine bag is a traditional North American Indian container for various items of supernatural power. While anyone may have one, usually it would be the medicine man, or shaman, of a tribe who would carry one. As something that holds supernatural items, the medicine bag must also have some power of its own.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/MedicineBagWabenoLoggingMuseum.jpg/220px-MedicineBagWabenoLoggingMuseum.jpg
