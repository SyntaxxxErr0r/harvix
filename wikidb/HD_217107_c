1.00	HD_217107_c	HD 217107 c	HD 217107 c is an extrasolar planet approximately 64 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Pisces (the Fish). The planet was the second planet to be discovered orbiting the star HD 217107. HD 217107 c's existence was hypothesized in 1998 and confirmed in 2005, when radial velocity studies of the star indicated another, more distant and massive companion orbiting the star. The planet is though to be a Jupiter twin planet, but its mass and orbital parameters remain highly uncertain.
