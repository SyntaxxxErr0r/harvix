1.00	Hobart_class	Hobart class destroyer	The Hobart class is a ship class of three air warfare destroyers (AWDs) being built for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Planning for a class to replace the Adelaide class frigates and restore the capability last exhibited by the Perth class destroyers began by 2000, initially under acquisition project SEA 1400, which was redesignated SEA 4000. Although the designation "Air Warfare Destroyer" is used to describe ships dedicated to the defence of a naval force (plus assets ashore) from aircraft and missile attack, the planned Australian destroyers would also be able to operate in anti-surface, anti-submarine, and naval gunfire support roles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Hobart_class_destroyer_CG_impression.jpg/300px-Hobart_class_destroyer_CG_impression.jpg
