6.72	Conservativism	Conservatism	Conservatism (Latin: , "to preserve") is a political and social philosophy that promotes the maintenance of traditional institutions and supports, at the most, minimal and gradual change in society. Some conservatives seek to preserve things as they are, emphasizing stability and continuity, while others oppose modernism and seek a return to "the way things were". The first established use of the term in a political context was by François-René de Chateaubriand in 1819, following the French Revolution. The term, historically associated with right-wing politics, has since been used to describe a wide range of views.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/EdmundBurke1771.jpg/160px-EdmundBurke1771.jpg
