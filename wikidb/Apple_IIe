106.4	Apple_IIe	Apple IIe	The Apple IIe is the third model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer. The e in the name stands for enhanced, referring to the fact that several popular features were now built-in that were only available as upgrades and add-ons in earlier models. It also improved upon expandability and added a few new features, which, all combined, made it very attractive to first-time computer shoppers as a general-purpose machine. The Apple IIe has the distinction of being the longest-lived computer in Apple's history, having been manufactured and sold for nearly 11 years with relatively few changes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Apple_IIe.jpg/250px-Apple_IIe.jpg
