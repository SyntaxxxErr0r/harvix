210.6	Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse	Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse	Revealed in the Taguba Report, an initial criminal investigation by the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command had already been underway, where soldiers of the 320th Military Police Battalion had been charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice with prisoner abuse. In 2004, articles describing the abuse, including pictures showing military personnel appearing to abuse prisoners, came to public attention, when a 60 Minutes II news report (April 28) and an article by Seymour M. Hersh in The New Yorker magazine (posted online on April 30 and published days later in the May 10 issue) reported the story.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Abu-ghraib-leash.jpg/220px-Abu-ghraib-leash.jpg
