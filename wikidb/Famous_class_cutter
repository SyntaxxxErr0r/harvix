1.00	Famous_class_cutter	Medium endurance cutter	The United States Coast Guard's cutter fleet contains numerous smaller vessels, and about three dozen large icebreakers, High endurance cutters, Medium Endurance cutters, and three National Security Cutters. There are two legacy vessels, the Alex Haley and the Acushnet. There are 13 vessels in the Famous class, and 14 vessels in the Reliance class. The Coast Guard plans to eventually phase out both of these cutters and replace them with the Offshore Patrol Cutter as part of the Deepwater Program.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/WLB_Storis_NWP.jpg/220px-WLB_Storis_NWP.jpg
