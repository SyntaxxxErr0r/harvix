27.86	Rod_(cryptozoology)	Rod (optics)	In cryptozoology, ufology, and outdoor photography, rods (sometimes known as "skyfish" or "solar entities") are elongated artifacts produced by cameras that inadvertently capture several of a flying insect's wingbeats. Videos of rod-shaped objects moving quickly through the air were claimed by some to be alien life forms or small UFOs, but subsequent experiments showed that these rods appear in film because of an optical illusion/collusion (especially in interlaced video recording).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Moths_attracted_by_floodlight.jpg/200px-Moths_attracted_by_floodlight.jpg
