102.2	Real-time_computing	Real-time computing	In computer science, real-time computing , or reactive computing, is the study of hardware and software systems that are subject to a "real-time constraint"â€” e.g. operational deadlines from event to system response. Real-time programs must guarantee response within strict time constraints. Often real-time response times are understood to be in the order of milliseconds and sometimes microseconds. In contrast, a non-real-time system is one that cannot guarantee a response time in any situation, even if a fast response is the usual result.
