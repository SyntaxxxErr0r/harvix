Headphones have wires which allow them to be connected to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player, or portable media player. They are also known as stereophones or, colloquially, cans. The in-ear versions are known as earphones or earbuds. In the context of telecommunication, the term headset is used to describe a combination of headphone and microphone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/4_adapter.jpg/220px-4_adapter.jpg
