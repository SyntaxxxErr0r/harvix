54.6	Burning_man	Burning Man	Burning Man is a week-long annual event held in the Black Rock Desert in northern Nevada, in the United States. The event starts on the Monday before the American Labor Day holiday, and ends on the holiday itself. It takes its name from the ritual burning of a large wooden effigy on Saturday evening. The event is described by many participants as an experiment in community, radical self-expression, and radical self-reliance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/BurningMan-picture.jpg/220px-BurningMan-picture.jpg
