64.6	Paris_Commune	Paris Commune	The Paris Commune or Fourth French Revolution was a government that briefly ruled Paris from March 18 (more formally, from March 28) to May 28, 1871. It existed before the split between anarchists and Marxists had taken place, and it is hailed by both groups as the first assumption of power by the working class during the Industrial Revolution. Debates over the policies and outcome of the Commune contributed to the break between those two political groups.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Red_flag.svg/125px-Red_flag.svg.png
