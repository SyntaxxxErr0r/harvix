1.20	Union_Pacific_Center	Union Pacific Center	The Union Pacific Center at 1400 Douglas Street is one of downtown Omaha, Nebraska's newest high-rise buildings. It houses the headquarters of the Union Pacific Railroad and its parent company, the Union Pacific Corporation. It officially opened in June 2004 and rises 317 ft (97 m) making it the fourth tallest building in Omaha. The old headquarters located directly across the street, was torn down in 2008 to make way for the new WallStreet Tower Omaha.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Union_pacific_center.jpg/200px-Union_pacific_center.jpg
