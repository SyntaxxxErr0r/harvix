118.7	Microcontroller	Microcontroller	A microcontroller (sometimes abbreviated ÂµC, uC or MCU) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a typically small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/153056995_5ef8b01016_o.jpg/230px-153056995_5ef8b01016_o.jpg
