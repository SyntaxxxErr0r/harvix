The church has five to seven million members worldwide and often garners media attention for the blessing ceremony, a mass wedding or marriage rededication ceremony that can feature sometimes thousands of participants. The church's portfolio of global interests has become a multi-billion-dollar empire. The holdings include the UPI, The Washington Times, and the Tongil Group, a one of the largest South Korean business group or chaebol with business interests world-wide. The church is the largest owner of U.S. sushi restaurants and in the Kodiak region of Alaska, it is the area's largest employer. The church owns the only automobile-manufacturing plant in North Korea (DPRK), Pyeonghwa Motors, and is the second largest exporter of Korean goods. Three of Moon's NGOs, namely Universal Peace Federation, Women's Federation for World Peace and Service for Peace, are in consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Sun_Myung_Moon.JPG/220px-Sun_Myung_Moon.JPG
