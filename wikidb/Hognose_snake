The hognose snakes consist of three distantly related genera that are artificially grouped together by the "hognose" common name: Heterodon which are predominantly found in United States and northern Mexico. Leioheterodon the Madagascar hognose snakes, and Lystrophis the South American or tri-colored hognose snakes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Heterodon_platirhinos.jpg/220px-Heterodon_platirhinos.jpg
