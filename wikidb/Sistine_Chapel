125.6	Sistine_Chapel	Sistine Chapel	Sistine Chapel (Latin: ; Italian: ) is the best-known chapel in the Apostolic Palace, the official residence of the Pope in the Vatican City. It is famous for its architecture and its decoration that was frescoed throughout by Renaissance artists including Michelangelo, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio and others. Under the patronage of Pope Julius II, Michelangelo painted 1,100 m2 (12,000 sq ft) of the chapel ceiling between 1508 and 1512. The ceiling, and especially The Last Judgment (1535â€“1541), is widely believed to be Michelangelo's crowning achievement in painting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Musei_vaticani%2C_cappella_sistina%2C_retro_02.JPG/250px-Musei_vaticani%2C_cappella_sistina%2C_retro_02.JPG
