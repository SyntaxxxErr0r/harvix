451.8	Subversion_(software)	Apache Subversion	Apache Subversion (often abbreviated SVN, after the command name svn) is a software versioning and revision control system distributed under an open source license. Developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly-compatible successor to the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/79/Subversion.png/250px-Subversion.png
