4.01	Tishtrya	Tishtrya	Tishtrya (Ti≈°trya) is the Avestan language name of an Zoroastrian benevolent divinity associated with life-bringing rainfall and fertility. Tishtrya is Tir in Middle- and Modern Persian. As has been judged from the archaic context in which Tishtrya appears in the texts of the Avesta, the divinity/concept is almost certainly of Indo-Iranian origin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Faravahar-Gold.svg/140px-Faravahar-Gold.svg.png
