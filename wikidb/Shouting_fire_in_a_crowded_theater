53.1	Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater	Shouting fire in a crowded theater	"Shouting fire in a crowded theatre" is a popular metaphor and frequent paraphrasing of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.'s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States in 1919. The paraphrasing does not generally include the fact that falsely shouting fire to highlight that speech which is merely dangerous and false which can be distinguished from that which is truthful but also dangerous. The quote is used as an example of speech which is claimed to serve no conceivable useful purpose and is extremely and imminently dangerous, such as distributing fliers in opposition to a military draft, so that resort to the courts or administrative procedures is not practical and expresses the permissible limitations on free speech consistent with the terms of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Freedom_of_speech_in_war_times.djvu/page6-180px-Freedom_of_speech_in_war_times.djvu.jpg
