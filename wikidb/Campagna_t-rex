Although classified as a motorcycle, the interior can accommodate the driver and passenger seated side-by-side, with adjustable seat backs, foot-pedal box, and three-point retractable safety belts. The manual transmission, controlled by hand, more closely resembles motorcycle transmissions than that of a car.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Green_Campagna_T-Rex_in_New_York.jpg/250px-Green_Campagna_T-Rex_in_New_York.jpg
