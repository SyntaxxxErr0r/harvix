90.3	Oslo_Accords	Oslo Accords	The Oslo Accords, officially called the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements or Declaration of Principles , was an attempt to resolve the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict. One of the major continuing issues within the wider Arab-Israeli conflict, it was the first direct, face-to-face agreement between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It was intended to be the one framework for future negotiations and relations between the Israeli government and Palestinians, within which all outstanding "final status issues" between the two sides would be addressed and resolved.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Is-wb-gs-gh_v3.png/170px-Is-wb-gs-gh_v3.png
