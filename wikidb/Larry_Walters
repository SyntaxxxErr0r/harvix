Dubbed Inspiration I, the "flying machine" consisted of an ordinary patio chair with 45 helium-filled weather balloons attached to it. Walters rose to an altitude of over 15,000 feet (4,600 m) and floated from his point of origin in San Pedro, California, into controlled airspace near Los Angeles International Airport. His flight was widely reported in many newspapers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/Larry_Walters.jpg/220px-Larry_Walters.jpg
