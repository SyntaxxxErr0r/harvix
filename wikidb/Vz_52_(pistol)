2.00	Vz_52_(pistol)	CZ 52	The CZ 52 (also known by the Czechoslovakian military designations vz. 52, for "model of 1952", and CZ 482) is a semi-automatic pistol designed by two brothers, Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl, in the early 1950s for the Czechoslovakian military. Around 200,000 vz. 52s were made by Česká Zbrojovka in Strakonice from 1952 to 1954. The vz. 52 replaced the 7.65 mm Browning caliber Vz.50, which had acquired a reputation for unreliability and was underpowered for its role as a military service sidearm. After 30 years of military service, the vz. 52 was eventually replaced by the 9x18mm Makarov caliber vz. 82. Cz-USA began importation into the US market in January 1998 with the designation CZ 52.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/CZ_52_pistol.jpg/300px-CZ_52_pistol.jpg
