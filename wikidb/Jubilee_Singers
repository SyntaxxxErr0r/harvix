3.00	Jubilee_Singers	Fisk Jubilee Singers	The Fisk Jubilee Singers are an African-American a cappella ensemble, consisting of students at Fisk University. The first group was organized in 1871 to tour and raise funds for their college. Their early repertoire consisted mostly of traditional spirituals, but included some Stephen Foster songs. The original group toured along the Underground Railroad path in the United States, as well as performing in England and Europe. Later nineteenth-century groups also toured in Europe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/JubileeSingers.gif/300px-JubileeSingers.gif
