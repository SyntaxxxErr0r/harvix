145.1	Saint_Valentine	Saint Valentine	Saint Valentine (in Latin, Valentinus) a widely recognized third century Roman saint commemorated on February 14 and is associated since the High Middle Ages with a tradition of courtly love. Nothing is known reliably of St. Valentine except his name, that he was buried on the Via Flaminia north of Rome on February 14, and that he was born on April 16. It is even uncertain whether St. Valentine is to be identified with only one saint or two saints of the same name. Several differing martyrologies have been added to later hagiographies that are unreliable. For these reasons this liturgical commemoration was not kept in the Catholic calendar of saints for universal liturgical veneration as revised in 1969. But "Martyr Valentinus the Presbyter and those with him at Rome" remains in the list of saints proposed for veneration by all Catholics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/St-Valentine-Kneeling-In-Supplication.jpg/220px-St-Valentine-Kneeling-In-Supplication.jpg
