4.21	Fiber_channel	Fibre Channel	Fibre Channel, or FC, is a gigabit-speed network technology primarily used for storage networking. Fibre Channel is standardized in the T11 Technical Committee of the InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards , an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)â€“accredited standards committee. Fibre Channel was primarily used in the supercomputer field, but now, has become the standard connection type for storage area networks (SAN) in enterprise storage. Despite its name, Fibre Channel signaling can run on both twisted pair copper wire and fiber-optic cables.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/FC-Topologies.jpg/220px-FC-Topologies.jpg
