2.00	Snowy_Owls	Snowy Owl	The Snowy Owl is a large owl of the typical owl family Strigidae. The Snowy Owl was first classified in 1758 by Carolus Linnaeus, the Swedish naturalist who developed binomial nomenclature to classify and organize plants and animals. The bird is also known in North America as the Arctic Owl, Great White Owl or Harfang. Until recently, it was regarded as the sole member of a distinct genus, as Nyctea scandiaca, but mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data (Olsen et al. 2002) shows that it is very closely related to the horned owls in the genus Bubo. The Snowy Owl is the official bird of Quebec.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Snowy_Owl_-_Schnee-Eule.jpg/250px-Snowy_Owl_-_Schnee-Eule.jpg
