66.7	Switched-mode_power_supply	Switched-mode power supply	A switched-mode power supply is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator in order to be highly efficient in the conversion of electrical power. Like other types of power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a source like the electrical power grid to a load (such as a personal computer) while converting voltage and current characteristics. An SMPS is usually employed to efficiently provide a regulated output voltage, typically at a level different from the input voltage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/ATX_power_supply_interior-1000px_transparent.png/250px-ATX_power_supply_interior-1000px_transparent.png
