168.7	Bamboo	Bamboo	Bamboo Â·) is a group of perennial evergreens in the true grass family Poaceae, subfamily Bambusoideae, tribe Bambuseae. Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family. In bamboo, the internodal regions of the stem are hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots, even of palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/BambooKyoto.jpg/220px-BambooKyoto.jpg
