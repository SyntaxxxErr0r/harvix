1.00	Density_dependent_inhibition	Density dependence	Density-dependent fecundity exists, where the birth rate falls as competition increases. In the context of gastrointestinal nematodes, the weight of female Ascaris lumbricoides and its rates of egg production decrease as host infection intensity increases. Thus, the per-capita contribution of each worm to transmission decreases as a function of infection intensity .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/Generalized_fecundity_graph.png/250px-Generalized_fecundity_graph.png
