121.0	Sunscreen	Sunscreen	Sunscreen (also commonly known as sunblock, sun tan lotion, sun screen, sun cream or block out) is a lotion, spray, gel or other topical product that absorbs or reflects some of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the skin exposed to sunlight and thus helps protect against sunburn. Skin-lightening products have sunscreen to protect lightened skin because light skin is more susceptible to sun damage than darker skin. A number of sunscreens have tanning power to help the skin to darken or tan, however tanning powder does not provide protection from UV rays.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Sunburn_blisters.jpg/267px-Sunburn_blisters.jpg
