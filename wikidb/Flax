90.5	Flax	Flax	Flax (also known as common flax or linseed) (binomial name: Linum usitatissimum) is a member of the genus Linum in the family Linaceae. It is native to the region extending from the eastern Mediterranean to India and was probably first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent. It is known as Λινάρι (Linari) in Greek, आलस (Aalas) in Nepali, Agasi/Akshi in Kannada, Aazhi Vidhai in Tamil, जवस (Jawas/Javas) or अळशी (Alashi) in Marathi and अलसी (Alsi) in Urdu and Hindi, তিসি (Tisi) in Bengali and అవిశలు (avisalu) in Telugu. Flax was extensively cultivated in ancient Ethiopia and ancient Egypt. In a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia, dyed flax fibers have been found that date to 30,000 BC, implicating it as the first domesticated species in human history. New Zealand flax is not related to flax but was named after it, as both plants are used to produce fibers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Linum_usitatissimum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-088.jpg/220px-Linum_usitatissimum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-088.jpg
