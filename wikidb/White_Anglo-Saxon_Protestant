56.9	White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant	White Anglo-Saxon Protestant	White Anglo-Saxon Protestant or WASP is an informal term, often derogatory or disparaging, for a closed group of high-status Americans mostly of British Protestant ancestry. The group supposedly wields disproportionate financial and social power. When it appears in writing, it is usually used to indicate the author's disapproval of the group's perceived excessive power in society. People seldom call themselves WASPs, except humorously; the term is typically used by non-WASPs. The term excludes most minority groups such as Catholics, Jews, Slavs, Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asians. The term is also used in Australia and Canada for similar powerful groups.
