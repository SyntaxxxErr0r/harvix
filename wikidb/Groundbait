3.01	Groundbait	Groundbait	Groundbait is used in coarse fishing in order to attract fish to the fishing area. It is a mixture of various natural ingredients, for example bread crumbs, vanilla sugar, hemp, maize and other ingredients, and moistened with water so it's possible to make balls. These balls are then thrown out into the water at the fishing spot. Depending on the groundbait mixture, the balls may break up quickly and create a "cloud" of particles in the water attractive for mid-water feeding fish, or sink to the bottom where they slowly release feed to species feeding on the bottom.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Float-tube-pikeangler.jpg/140px-Float-tube-pikeangler.jpg
