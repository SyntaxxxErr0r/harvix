3.11	Portrait_de_l'artiste_sans_barbe	Self-portraits by Vincent van Gogh	The dozens of self-portraits by Vincent van Gogh were an important part of his oeuvre as a painter. Vincent van Gogh created many self-portraits during his lifetime. Most probably, Van Gogh's self portraits are depicting the face as it appeared in the mirror he used to reproduce his face, i.e. his right side in the image is in reality the left side of his face.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_102.jpg/220px-Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_102.jpg
