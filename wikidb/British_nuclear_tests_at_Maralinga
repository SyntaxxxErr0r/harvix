21.53	British_nuclear_tests_at_Maralinga	British nuclear tests at Maralinga	British nuclear tests at Maralinga occurred between 1955 and 1963 at the Maralinga site, part of the Woomera Prohibited Area, in South Australia. A total of seven nuclear tests were performed, with approximate yields ranging from 1 to 27 kilotons of TNT equivalent. The site was also used for hundreds of minor trials, many of which were intended to investigate the effects of fire or non-nuclear explosions on atomic weapons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/AusNucTestSites.svg/300px-AusNucTestSites.svg.png
