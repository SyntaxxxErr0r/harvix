103.2	Thought	Thought	Thought generally refers to any mental or intellectual activity involving an individual's subjective consciousness. It can refer either to the act of thinking or the resulting ideas or arrangements of ideas. Similar concepts include cognition, sentience, consciousness, and imagination. Because thought underlies almost all human actions and interactions, understanding its physical and metaphysical origins, processes, and effects has been a longstanding goal of many academic disciplines including, among others, biology, philosophy, psychology, and sociology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Almeida_J%C3%BAnior_-_Mo%C3%A7a_com_Livro.jpg/220px-Almeida_J%C3%BAnior_-_Mo%C3%A7a_com_Livro.jpg
