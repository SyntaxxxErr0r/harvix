89.1	Ionosphere	Ionosphere	At night the F layer is the only layer of significant ionization present, while the ionization in the E and D layers is extremely low. During the day, the D and E layers become much more heavily ionized, as does the F layer, which develops an additional, weaker region of ionisation known as the F1 layer. The F2 layer persists by day and night and is the region mainly responsible for the refraction of radio waves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Atmosphere_with_Ionosphere.svg/400px-Atmosphere_with_Ionosphere.svg.png
