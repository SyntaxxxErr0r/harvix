187.1	Angkor_Wat	Angkor Wat	Angkor Wat (Khmer: ) is a temple complex at Angkor, Cambodia, built by King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century as his state temple and capital city. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation â€“ first Hindu, dedicated to the god Vishnu, then Buddhist. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its national flag, and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Angkor_Wat.jpg/280px-Angkor_Wat.jpg
