Windows CE is a distinct operating system and kernel, rather than a trimmed-down version of desktop Windows. It is not to be confused with Windows Embedded Standard which is an NT-based componentized version of desktop Microsoft Windows.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Windows_CE.png/220px-Windows_CE.png
