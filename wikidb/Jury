92.9	Jury	Jury	A jury is a sworn body of people convened to render an impartial verdict (a finding of fact on a question) officially submitted to them by a court, or to set a penalty or judgment. Modern juries tend to be found in courts to ascertain the guilt, or lack thereof, in a crime. In Anglophone jurisdictions, the verdict may be guilty, not guilty, or (in Scotland) not proven. Juries are composed of jurors (also sometimes known as jurymen), who are by definition layman finders of fact, not professionals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Jury_box_cropped.jpg/250px-Jury_box_cropped.jpg
