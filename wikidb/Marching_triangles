3.10	Marching_triangles	Marching triangles	In computer graphics, marching triangles is a technique for reconstructing two-dimensional surface geometry from an unstructured point cloud. Point clouds are typically generated from 3D laser scanning of real-world objects. In the past, accurate reconstruction methods employed Delaunay triangulations. However, newer techniques such as Marching Triangles and Ball-Pivoting employ a moving boundary front to reconstruct point cloud surfaces.
