73.7	Quagga	Quagga	The quagga is an extinct subspecies of the plains zebra, which was once found in great numbers in the Highveld of the Cape Province and the southern part of the Orange Free State in South Africa. It was distinguished from other zebras by having the usual vivid marks on the front part of the body only. In the mid-section, the stripes faded and the dark, inter-stripe spaces became wider, and the rear parts were a plain brown. The name comes from a Khoikhoi word for zebra and is onomatopoeic, being said to resemble the quagga's call. The only quagga to have been photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London's Zoo in Regent's Park in 1870.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Quagga_photo.jpg/250px-Quagga_photo.jpg
