274.8	Cosplay	Cosplay	Cosplay kosupure), short for "costume play", is a type of performance art in which participants don costumes and accessories to represent a specific character or idea. Favorite sources include manga, anime, comic books, graphic novels, video games and films. Any entity from the real or virtual world that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject. Inanimate objects are given anthropomorphic forms and it is not unusual to see genders switched, with women playing male roles and vice versa. There is also a subset of cosplay culture centered around sex appeal, with cosplayers specifically choosing characters that are known for their attractiveness and/or revealing (even explicit) costumes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Anime_eye.svg/150px-Anime_eye.svg.png
