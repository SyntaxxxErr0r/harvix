84.8	Clarence_Darrow	Clarence Darrow	Clarence Seward Darrow (April 18, 1857 â€“ March 13, 1938) was an American lawyer and leading member of the American Civil Liberties Union, best known for defending teenage thrill killers Leopold and Loeb in their trial for murdering 14-year-old Robert "Bobby" Franks (1924) and defending John T. Scopes in the Scopes "Monkey" Trial (1925), in which he opposed William Jennings Bryan (statesman, noted orator, and 3-time presidential candidate). Called a "sophisticated country lawyer", he remains notable for his wit and agnosticism, which marked him as one of the most famous American lawyers and civil libertarians.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Clarence_Darrow.jpg/220px-Clarence_Darrow.jpg
