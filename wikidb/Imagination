60.2	Imagination	Imagination	Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the ability of forming images and sensations when they are not perceived through sight, hearing, or other senses. Imagination helps provide meaning to experience and understanding to knowledge; it is a fundamental faculty through which people make sense of the world, and it also plays a key role in the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling , in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to "evoke worlds." It is a whole cycle of image formation or any sensation which may be described as "hidden" as it takes place without anyone else's knowledge.The research has suggested that about 60% of people are imaginative. A person may imagine according to his mood, it may be good or bad depending on the situation. Some people imagine in a state of tension or gloominess in order to calm themselves. It is accepted as the innate ability and process of inventing partial or complete personal realms within the mind from elements derived from sense perceptions of the shared world. The term is technically used in psychology for the process of reviving in the mind, percepts of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary language, some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "imaging" or "imagery" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. Imagined images are seen with the "mind's eye."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Imagination-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg/200px-Imagination-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg
