103.0	Millet	Millet	The millets are a group of small-seeded species of cereal crops or grains, widely grown around the world for food and fodder. They do not form a taxonomic group, but rather a functional or agronomic one. Their essential similarities are that they are small-seeded grasses grown in difficult production environments such as those at risk of drought. They have been in cultivation in East Asia for the last 10,000 years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Grain_millet%2C_early_grain_fill%2C_Tifton%2C_7-3-02.jpg/220px-Grain_millet%2C_early_grain_fill%2C_Tifton%2C_7-3-02.jpg
