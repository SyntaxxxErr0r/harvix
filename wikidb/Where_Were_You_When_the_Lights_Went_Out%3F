Where Were You When the Lights Went Out? is a 1968 American comedy film with Doris Day, directed by Hy Averback. Although it is set in New York City during the major blackout of November 9, 1965, in which 25 million people scattered throughout seven northeastern states and Ontario, Canada lost electric power for several hours, the screenplay by Everett Freeman and Karl Tunberg is based on the 1956 French play Monsieur Masure by Claude Magnier.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/WhereWereYouWhentheLightsWentOutPoster.jpg/220px-WhereWereYouWhentheLightsWentOutPoster.jpg
