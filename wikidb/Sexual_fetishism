59.9	Sexual_fetishism	Sexual fetishism	Sexual fetishism, or erotic fetishism, is the sexual arousal a person receives from a physical object, or from a specific situation. The object or situation of interest is called the fetish, the person a fetishist who has a fetish for that object/situation. A sexual fetish may be regarded as an enhancing element to a romantic/sexual relationship "achieved in ordinary ways (e.g. having the partner wear a particular garment)" or as a mental disorder/disorder of sexual preference if it causes significant psychosocial distress for the person or has detrimental effects on important areas of their life. Arousal from a particular body part is classified as partialism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Martin_van_Maele_-_La_Comtesse_au_fouet_01.jpg/230px-Martin_van_Maele_-_La_Comtesse_au_fouet_01.jpg
