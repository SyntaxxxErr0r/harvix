It is based on the well-known Hainanese dish called Wenchang chicken (文昌雞), due to its roots in Hainan cuisine and its adoption by the Hainanese overseas Chinese population in the Nanyang area (present-day Southeast Asia).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Hainanese_Chicken_Rice.jpg/230px-Hainanese_Chicken_Rice.jpg
