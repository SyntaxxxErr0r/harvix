They are distributed across 67 counties, in addition to 66 county governments. Jacksonville has the only consolidated cityâ€“county government in the state, so there is no Duval County government. However, smaller municipal governments exist within the consolidated municipality, i.e., Baldwin and the Jacksonville Beaches. All but one of Florida's county seats are incorporated municipalities. The exception is Crawfordville, county seat of rural Wakulla County.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Map_of_USA_FL.svg/220px-Map_of_USA_FL.svg.png
