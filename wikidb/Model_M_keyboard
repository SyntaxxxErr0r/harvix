52.4	Model_M_keyboard	Model M keyboard	The Model M keyboard, colloquially called a clicky keyboard, is a class of computer keyboards manufactured by IBM, Lexmark and Unicomp, starting in 1984. The many different variations of the keyboard have their own distinct characteristics, with the vast majority having a buckling spring key design and many having fully swappable keycaps. Model M keyboards have been prized by computer enthusiasts and heavy typists because of the tactile and auditory feedback resulting from a keystroke.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/ModelM.jpg/200px-ModelM.jpg
