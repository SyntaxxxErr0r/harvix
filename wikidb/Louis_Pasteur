228.1	Louis_Pasteur	Louis Pasteur	Louis Pasteur ( , French: ; December 27, 1822 â€“ September 28, 1895) was a French chemist and microbiologist born in Dole. He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and preventions of diseases. His discoveries reduced mortality from puerperal fever, and he created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax. His experiments supported the germ theory of disease. He was best known to the general public for inventing a method to stop milk and wine from causing sickness, a process that came to be called pasteurization. He is regarded as one of the three main founders of microbiology, together with Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch. Pasteur also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry, most notably the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals. His body lies beneath the Institute Pasteur in Paris in a spectacular vault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in Byzantine mosaics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Louis_Pasteur_by_Pierre_Lamy_Petit.jpg/220px-Louis_Pasteur_by_Pierre_Lamy_Petit.jpg
