He was a bay colt sired by Longstreet out of the mare Stone Nellie (by imported Stonehenge). His grandsire was the great racer and top nineteenth century sire Longfellow, himself a son of the important foundation sire Leamington. Stone Street was bred by noted horseman James Ben Ali Haggin, who had won the Derby in 1886 with his entry Ben Ali. Stone Street has also been called Stonestreet in other racing publications and is named after a combination of his sire and dam's names.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Stone_Street_1908.jpg/225px-Stone_Street_1908.jpg
