55.8	Claymation	Clay animation	All traditional animation is produced in a similar fashion, whether done through cel animation or stop motion. Each frame, or still picture, is recorded on film or digital media and then played back in rapid succession. When played back at a frame rate greater than 10â€“12 frames per second, a fairly convincing illusion of continuous motion is achieved. While the playback feature creating an illusion is true of all moving images (from zoetrope to films to videogames), the techniques involved in creating CGI are generally removed from a frame-by-frame process.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Animacion-con-plastilina-y-clay-animation-pelicula-Kuzmich-153.jpg/250px-Animacion-con-plastilina-y-clay-animation-pelicula-Kuzmich-153.jpg
