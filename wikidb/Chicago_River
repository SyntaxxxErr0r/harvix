51.4	Chicago_River	Chicago River	The Chicago River is a system of rivers and canals with a combined length of 156 miles (251 km) that runs through the city of the same name, including its center (the Chicago Loop). Though not especially long, the river is notable for being the reason why Chicago became an important location, as the link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley waterways. In the 19th century through civil engineering, the flow of the river was reversed to head toward the Mississippi River basin, away from Lake Michigan, into which it previously emptied. This was done for reasons of sanitation. The river is also noted for the local custom of dyeing it green on St. Patrick's Day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/GOYK1191s.JPG/260px-GOYK1191s.JPG
