2.20	N%C3%A1dasdy	Nádasdy	The Nádasdy, also spelled Nadasdy in English, is a major Hungarian aristocratic family whose roots reach into the Middle Ages. Their motto is: "SI DEUS PRO NOBIS QUIS CONTRA NOS" ("If God is for us, who can be against us?"). The Nadasdy family made a large contribution to the development of Hungarian printing. The Nadasdy Hussars, a regiment named after the family, developed a strategy incorporating lightly armed and fast-moving cavalry that was internationally adopted.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/N%C3%A1dasdy_Tam%C3%A1s1.jpg/125px-N%C3%A1dasdy_Tam%C3%A1s1.jpg
