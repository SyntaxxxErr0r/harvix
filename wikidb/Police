160.2	Police	Police	The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie and military police are military units charged with civil policing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/HH_Polizeihauptmeister_MZ.jpg/220px-HH_Polizeihauptmeister_MZ.jpg
