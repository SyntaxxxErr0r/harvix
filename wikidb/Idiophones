1.00	Idiophones	Idiophone	An idiophone is any musical instrument which creates sound primarily by way of the instrument's vibrating, without the use of strings or membranes. It is the first of the four main divisions in the original Hornbostel-Sachs scheme of musical instrument classification (see List of idiophones by Hornbostel-Sachs number). In the early classification of Victor-Charles Mahillon, this group of instruments was called autophones.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/5_Leaf_Kouxian.jpg/200px-5_Leaf_Kouxian.jpg
