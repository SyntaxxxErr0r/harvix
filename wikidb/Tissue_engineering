51.6	Tissue_engineering	Tissue engineering	Tissue engineering is the use of a combination of cells, engineering and materials methods, and suitable biochemical and physio-chemical factors to improve or replace biological functions. While it was once categorized as a sub-field of bio materials, having grown in scope and importance it can be considered as a field in its own right.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Tissue_engineering_english.jpg/220px-Tissue_engineering_english.jpg
