29.71	Tusk_(album)	Tusk (album)	Tusk is the 12th album by the British/American rock band Fleetwood Mac. Released in 1979, it is considered experimental, primarily due to Lindsey Buckingham's sparser songwriting arrangements and the influence of punk rock and New Wave on his production techniques. Bassist John McVie has commented that the album sounds like "the work of three solo artists" (Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie), whilst Mick Fleetwood later proclaimed that it is his favourite and the best Fleetwood Mac studio album created by the group. Costing over one million dollars to record (a fact widely noted in the 1979 press), it was the most expensive rock album made up to that point.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/Fleetwood_Mac_-_Tusk.jpg/220px-Fleetwood_Mac_-_Tusk.jpg
