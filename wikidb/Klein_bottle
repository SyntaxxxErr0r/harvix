114.6	Klein_bottle	Klein bottle	In mathematics, the Klein bottle ( ) is a non-orientable surface, informally, a surface (a two-dimensional manifold) in which notions of left and right cannot be consistently defined. Other related non-orientable objects include the Möbius strip and the real projective plane. Whereas a Möbius strip is a surface with boundary, a Klein bottle has no boundary. (For comparison, a sphere is an orientable surface with no boundary.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Klein_bottle.svg/240px-Klein_bottle.svg.png
