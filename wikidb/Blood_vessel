118.5	Blood_vessel	Blood vessel	The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Circulatory_System_en.svg/250px-Circulatory_System_en.svg.png
