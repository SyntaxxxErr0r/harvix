Knievel died of pulmonary disease in Clearwater, Florida, aged 69. According to The Times writing his obituary, Knievel was one of the greatest American icons of the 1970s. Knievel was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1999.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/At_Home_With_Evel_Knievel.jpg/220px-At_Home_With_Evel_Knievel.jpg
