303.8	Blogosphere	Blogosphere	In 2007, following six weeks of observation social media expert Matthew Hurst mapped the blogosphere, generating the plot to the left based on the interconnections between blogs. The most densely populated areas represent the most active portions of the blogosphere. White dots represent individual blogs. They are sized according to the number of links surrounding that particular blog. Links are plotted in both green and blue, with green representing one-way links and blue representing reciprocal links.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Blogosphere_map.jpg/220px-Blogosphere_map.jpg
