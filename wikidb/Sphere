66.5	Sphere	Sphere	A sphere (from Greek σφαῖρα — sphaira, "globe, ball") is a perfectly round geometrical object in three-dimensional space, such as the shape of a round ball. Like a circle, which is in two dimensions, a perfect sphere is completely symmetrical around its center, with all points on the surface lying the same distance r from the center point. This distance r is known as the "radius" of the sphere. The maximum straight distance through the sphere is known as the "diameter" of the sphere. It passes through the center and is thus twice the radius.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Sphere_wireframe_10deg_6r.svg/220px-Sphere_wireframe_10deg_6r.svg.png
