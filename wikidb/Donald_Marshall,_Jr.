4.60	Donald_Marshall,_Jr.	Donald Marshall, Jr.	Donald Marshall, Jr. (13 September 1953 â€“ 6 August 2009) was a Mi'kmaq man who was wrongly convicted of murder. The case inspired a number of disturbing questions about the fairness of the Canadian justice system, especially given that Marshall was an Aboriginal; as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation put it, "The name Donald Marshall is almost synonymous with 'wrongful conviction' and the fight for native justice in Canada." The case inspired the book and film Justice Denied. His father, Donald Marshall, Sr., was grand chief of the Mi'kmaq Nation at the time.
