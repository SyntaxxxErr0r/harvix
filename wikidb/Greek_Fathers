2.00	Greek_Fathers	Church Fathers	The Church Fathers, Early Church Fathers, Christian Fathers, or Fathers of the Church were early and influential theologians, eminent Christian teachers and great bishops. Their scholarly works were used as a precedent for centuries to come. The term is used of writers and teachers of the Church, not necessarily "saints", though most are honoured as saints in the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches, as well as in some other Christian groups; notably, the heretics Origen and Tertullian are generally reckoned as Church Fathers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Otsy.jpg/300px-Otsy.jpg
