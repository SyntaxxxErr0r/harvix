56.5	Acela_Express	Acela Express	The Acela Express ( -É™; often simply Acela) is Amtrak's high-speed rail service along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) in the Northeast United States between Washington, D.C., and Boston via Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. It uses tilting technology which allows the train to travel at higher speeds on the sharply curved NEC without disturbing passengers, by lowering lateral centrifugal forces, based on the concept of banked turns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Acela_logo.png
