35.28	Civil_township	Civil township	A civil township is a widely used unit of local government in the United States, subordinate to a county. The term town is used in New England, New York and Wisconsin to refer to the equivalent of the civil township in these states. Specific responsibilities and the degree of autonomy vary based on each state. Civil townships are distinct from survey townships, but in states that have both, the boundaries often coincide, and may completely geographically subdivide a county. The U.S. Census Bureau classifies civil townships as minor civil divisions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Meridians-baselines.png/220px-Meridians-baselines.png
