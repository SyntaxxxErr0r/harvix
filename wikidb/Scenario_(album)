3.00	Scenario_(album)	Scenario (album)	Scenario is a 1983 album by jazz fusion guitarist, Al Di Meola. It furthered the musical direction that became apparent on his previous album Electric Rendezvous and saw a greater influence of keyboard player Jan Hammer on the album. Other musicians on this album include Phil Collins (drums - "Island Dreamer)", Tony Levin (electric stick bass - "Calliope") and Bill Bruford (Simmons electric drums - "Calliope"). The Fairlight CMI was heavily used on some tracks, and is visible in the Sequencer video.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b5/Scenario_album.jpg/220px-Scenario_album.jpg
