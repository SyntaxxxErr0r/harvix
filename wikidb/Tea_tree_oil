61.5	Tea_tree_oil	Tea tree oil	Tea tree oil, or melaleuca oil, is a pale yellow colour to nearly colorless and clear essential oil with a fresh camphoraceous odor. It is taken from the leaves of the Melaleuca alternifolia, which is native to the northeast coast of New South Wales, Australia. Tea tree oil should not be confused with tea oil, the sweet seasoning and cooking oil from pressed seeds of the tea plant Camellia sinensis (beverage tea), or the tea oil plant Camellia oleifera.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/MelaleucaAlternifoliaEssOil.png/220px-MelaleucaAlternifoliaEssOil.png
