Surrounding agricultural land is largely dedicated to sugar cane and cattle. At one time, when the city was an active rail stop with regular passenger service, it was named simply União due to its rail junction joining Alagoas and Pernambuco. The name was changed in 1944 to reflect its historic significance. The city is increasingly seeing domestic and foreign tourist drawn by historical and natural features that are now protected in Parque Nacional Serra da Barriga and Parque Memorial Quilombo dos Palmares.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Rail_Station_Uni%C3%A3o_dos_Palmares_.jpg/300px-Rail_Station_Uni%C3%A3o_dos_Palmares_.jpg
