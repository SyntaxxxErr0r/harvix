1.00	Claude_de_Jouffroy	Claude-François-Dorothée, marquis de Jouffroy d'Abbans	In 1783, he made a paddle steamer named the Pyroscaphe ply on the Saône in 1783. However the Académie des Sciences prohibited him from using his invention in Paris, and instead nominated Perier, one of d'Abbans' opponents whose previous attempts had failed, to inspect the project. Further misfortunes due to the French Revolution hindered his progress. His claim was acknowledged by Arago and in 1840 by the French Academy.New International Encyclopedia Jouffroy published Les bateaux à vapeur and wrote for the Academy Mémoires sur les pompes à feu. Impoverished, he retired to the Hôtel des Invalides and died there of cholera.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/D%27AbbansSteamshipModel.jpg/350px-D%27AbbansSteamshipModel.jpg
