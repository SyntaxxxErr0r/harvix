74.3	Slavery_in_the_United_States	Slavery in the United States	Slavery in the United States was a form of slave labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776. This continued mostly in the Southern United States until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This happened in 1865 following the American Civil War. The first English colony in North America, Virginia, acquired its first Africans in 1619, after a ship arrived that carried a cargo of about 20 Africans. The practice established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s was expanded into English North America.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Slave_auction_block_Green_Hill_Plantation.jpg/150px-Slave_auction_block_Green_Hill_Plantation.jpg
