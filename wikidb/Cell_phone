96.6	Cell_phone	Mobile phone	A mobile phone (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone and a hand phone) is a device that can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link whilst moving around a wide geographic area. It does so by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator, allowing access to the public telephone network. By contrast, a cordless telephone is used only within the short range of a single, private base station.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Two_Cell_Phones.png/220px-Two_Cell_Phones.png
