66.5	Inbound_marketing	Inbound marketing	Inbound marketing is a marketing strategy that focuses on attracting prospective customers by offering useful information. Brian Halligan, cofounder and CEO of HubSpot, claims he coined the usage of the term in this sense. It is related to relationship marketing and Seth Godin's idea of permission marketing. David Meerman Scott recommends that marketers "earn their way in" (via publishing helpful information on a blog etc.) in contrast to outbound marketing where they "buy, beg, or bug their way in" (via paid advertisements, issuing press releases in the hope they get picked up by the trade press, or paying commissioned sales people, respectively).
