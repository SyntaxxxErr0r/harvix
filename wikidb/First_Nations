94.2	First_Nations	First Nations	First Nations is a term that collectively refers to various Aboriginal peoples in Canada who are neither Inuit nor MÃ©tis. There are currently over 630 recognised First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada, roughly half of which are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. The total population is nearly 700,000 people. Under the Employment Equity Act, First Nations are a "designated group", along with women, visible minorities, and persons with physical or mental disabilities. They are not defined as a visible minority under the Act or by the criteria of Statistics Canada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/Mrs._Joe_Capilano.jpg/170px-Mrs._Joe_Capilano.jpg
