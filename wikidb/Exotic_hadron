7.13	Exotic_hadron	Exotic hadron	Exotic hadrons are subatomic particles made of quarks (and possibly gluons), but which do not fit into the usual scheme of hadrons. While bound by the strong interaction they are not predicted by the simple quark model. That is, exotic hadrons do not have the same quark content as ordinary hadrons: exotic baryons have more than just the three quarks of ordinary baryons and exotic mesons do not have one quark and one antiquark like ordinary mesons. Exotic hadrons can be searched for by looking for particles with quantum numbers forbidden to ordinary hadrons. Experimental signatures for exotic hadrons have been seen recently but remain a topic of controversy in particle physics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Meson.svg/282px-Meson.svg.png
