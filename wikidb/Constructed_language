79.9	Constructed_language	Constructed language	A planned or constructed language—known colloquially as a conlang—is a language whose phonology, grammar, and/or vocabulary has been consciously devised by an individual or group, instead of having evolved naturally. There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language: to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language and code); to give fiction or an associated constructed world an added layer of realism; for linguistic experimentation; for artistic creation; and for language games.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Conlangflag.svg/220px-Conlangflag.svg.png
