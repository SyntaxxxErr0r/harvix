156.1	Timothy_Leary	Timothy Leary	Timothy Francis Leary (October 22, 1920 â€“ May 31, 1996) was an American psychologist and writer, known for his advocacy of psychedelic drugs. During a time when drugs such as LSD and psilocybin were legal, Leary conducted experiments at Harvard University under the Harvard Psilocybin Project, resulting in the Concord Prison Experiment and the Marsh Chapel Experiment. Both studies produced useful data, but Leary and his associate Richard Alpert were fired from the university.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Timothy-Leary-Los-Angeles-1989.jpg
