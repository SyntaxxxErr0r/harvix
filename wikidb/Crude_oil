80.4	Crude_oil	Petroleum	Petroleum or crude oil is a naturally occurring, flammable liquid consisting of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights and other liquid organic compounds, that are found in geologic formations beneath the Earth's surface. A fossil fuel, it is formed when large quantities of dead organisms, usually zooplankton and algae, are buried underneath sedimentary rock and undergo intense heat and pressure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Oil_Reserves.png/400px-Oil_Reserves.png
