It had historically been an all-boys' boarding school. The first girls entered the 6th Form in the 1960s and the school decided to take girls at age 11 in 1998. In 2000 with the closure of sister school St Maurs, the two schools merged to make St George's fully co-educational.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Sgc_logo_cropped.jpg/150px-Sgc_logo_cropped.jpg
