55.1	Police_state	Police state	A police state is one in which the government exercises rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic and political life of the population. A police state typically exhibits elements of totalitarianism and social control, and there is usually little or no distinction between the law and the exercise of political power by the executive.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/2009_Freedom_House_world_map.svg/350px-2009_Freedom_House_world_map.svg.png
