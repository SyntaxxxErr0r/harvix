71.3	Ketchup	Ketchup	Ketchup (also catsup, tomato sauce, or red sauce) is a sweet-and-tangy food sauce, typically made from tomatoes, vinegar, a sweetener, and assorted seasonings and spices. The sweetener is most commonly sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Seasonings vary by recipe, but commonly include onions, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, garlic, and celery. Ketchup is often used as a condiment with french fries (chips), hamburgers, sandwiches, and grilled or fried meat. In Australia and New Zealand it is called tomato sauce, and is commonly accompanied with savory baked goods such as meat pies and sausage rolls. Ketchup is sometimes used as a basis or ingredient for other sauces and dressings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Organic_Heinz_Tomato_Ketchup.jpg/100px-Organic_Heinz_Tomato_Ketchup.jpg
