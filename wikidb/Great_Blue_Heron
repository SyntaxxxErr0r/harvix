It is a rare vagrant to Europe, with records from Spain, the Azores, England and the Netherlands. An all-white population found only in the Caribbean and southern Florida was once known as a separate species, the Great White Heron.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/GBHfish5.jpg/300px-GBHfish5.jpg
