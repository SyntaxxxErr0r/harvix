61.1	Sweeney_Todd	Sweeney Todd	Sweeney Todd is a fictional character who first appeared as the murderer of the Victorian penny dreadful The String of Pearls (1846â€“1847) and he was later introduced as an antihero of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and its film adaptations. Claims that Sweeney Todd was a historical person are strongly disputed by scholars, although there are possible legendary prototypes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d4/Todsweeny.jpg/200px-Todsweeny.jpg
