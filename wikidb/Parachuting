50.9	Parachuting	Parachuting	Parachuting, also known as skydiving, is the action of exiting an aircraft and returning to earth with the aid of a parachute. It may or may not involve a certain amount of free-fall, a time during which the parachute has not been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to terminal velocity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Parachuters_in_hybrid_formation.jpg/220px-Parachuters_in_hybrid_formation.jpg
