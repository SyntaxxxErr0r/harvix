The abortion-breast cancer hypothesis posits that if a pregnancy is aborted prior to differentiation it could have an adverse effect by creating and leaving behind more immature cells to be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Breast_anatomy_drawing.png/200px-Breast_anatomy_drawing.png
