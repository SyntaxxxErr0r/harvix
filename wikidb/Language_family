53.0	Language_family	Language family	A language family is group of languages related through descent from a common ancestor, called the proto-language of that family. The term 'family' comes from the tree model of language origination in historical linguistics, which makes use of a metaphor comparing languages to people in a biological family tree or in a subsequent modification to species in a phylogenetic tree of evolutionary taxonomy. All the apparently biological terms are used only in the metaphoric sense: No actual biology relationship is implied by the metaphor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f7/Human_Language_Families_Map.PNG/550px-Human_Language_Families_Map.PNG
