65.9	Garrett_Hardin	Garrett Hardin	Garrett James Hardin (April 21, 1915 â€“ September 14, 2003) was an American ecologist who warned of the dangers of overpopulation and whose concept of the tragedy of the commons brought attention to "the damage that innocent actions by individuals can inflict on the environment". He was most well known for his elaboration of this theme in his 1968 paper, The Tragedy of the Commons. He is also known for Hardin's First Law of Ecology, which states "You cannot do only one thing", and used the familiar phrase "Nice guys finish last" to sum up the "selfish gene" concept of life and evolution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Garrett_Hardin.jpg/150px-Garrett_Hardin.jpg
