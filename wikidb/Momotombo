8.22	Momotombo	Momotombo	Momotombo is a stratovolcano in Nicaragua, not far from the city of Le贸n. It stands on the shores of Lago de Managua. An eruption of the volcano in 1610 forced inhabitants of the Spanish city of Le贸n to relocate about 30 miles west. The ruins of this city are preserved at Le贸n Viejo (Old Le贸n).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Momotombo.jpg/280px-Momotombo.jpg
