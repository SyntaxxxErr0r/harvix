157.7	Milky_Way	Milky Way	The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains the Earth. This name derives from its appearance as a dim "milky" glowing band arching across the night sky, in which the naked eye cannot distinguish individual stars. The term "Milky Way" is a translation of the Classical Latin via lactea, from the Hellenistic Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (pr. galaxías kýklos, "milky circle").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/ESO-VLT-Laser-phot-33a-07_rsz.jpg/300px-ESO-VLT-Laser-phot-33a-07_rsz.jpg
