34.62	Manager_(professional_wrestling)	Manager (professional wrestling)	In professional wrestling, a manager is a secondary character paired with a wrestler (or wrestlers) for a variety of reasons. The manager is often either a non-wrestler, an occasional wrestler, an older wrestler who has retired or is nearing retirement or, in some cases, a new wrestler who is breaking into the business (or a specific company) and needs the experience in front of the crowds. The wrestler that a manager manages is called his or her charge. A wrestler's manager has nothing to do with their real-world agent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Paul_Bearer_in_1996.jpg/220px-Paul_Bearer_in_1996.jpg
