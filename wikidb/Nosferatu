168.7	Nosferatu	Nosferatu	(translated as Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror; or simply Nosferatu) is a classic 1922 German Expressionist horror film, directed by F. W. Murnau, starring Max Schreck as the vampire Count Orlok. The film, shot in 1921 and released in 1922, was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, with names and other details changed because the studio could not obtain the rights to the novel (for instance, "vampire" became "Nosferatu" and "Count Dracula" became "Count Orlok").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Nosferatu-movie-poster-11x17-large-style-c.jpg/220px-Nosferatu-movie-poster-11x17-large-style-c.jpg
