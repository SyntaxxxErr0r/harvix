4.30	South_African_apartheid_referendum,_1992	South African apartheid referendum, 1992	The 1992 referendum was held in South Africa on 17 March of that year. In it, white South Africans were asked to vote in the country's last whites-only referendum to determine whether or not they supported the negotiated reforms begun by State President F.W. de Klerk two years earlier, in which he proposed to end the apartheid that had been started in 1948. The result of the election was a large victory for the "yes" side, which ultimately resulted in apartheid being lifted.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/ZA1992Referendum.svg/250px-ZA1992Referendum.svg.png
