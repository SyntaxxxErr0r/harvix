23.62	Spenser_(character)	Spenser (character)	The Spenser books were the inspiration for the 1985-1988 ABC TV series Spenser: For Hire starring Robert Urich as Spenser, Barbara Stock as Susan, and Avery Brooks as Hawk. Though the series has not been available in broadcast syndication for many years, it has recently been made part of the lineup at AOL's new in2TV online broadcasting site. The series has also never been released on DVD, though several internet vendors sell bootleg sets of questionable quality.
