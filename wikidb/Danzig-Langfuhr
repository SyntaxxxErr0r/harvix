1.00	Danzig-Langfuhr	Wrzeszcz	Between 1767 and 1770, Danzig mayor Daniel Gralath made a personal project of turning the two kilometers of old road between Langfuhr and Danzig proper into the four-lane, tree-lined Grand Avenue, as it was then renamed. Each lane of the avenue was lined by 350 trees imported from the Netherlands, and the entire cost of the project was the immense sum (for the time) of 100,000 guilders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Dzielnice_Gdansk_Wrzeszcz.svg/200px-Dzielnice_Gdansk_Wrzeszcz.svg.png
