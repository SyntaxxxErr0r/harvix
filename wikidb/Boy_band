59.9	Boy_band	Boy band	A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a popular music act consisting of only male singers. The members are expected to dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances. More often than not, boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, and only sing and dance, making the term somewhat of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. In many cases boy bands are brought together by a producer through an audition process, although many of them form on their own.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/The-Osmonds.jpg/220px-The-Osmonds.jpg
