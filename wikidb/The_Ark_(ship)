1.20	The_Ark_(ship)	The Ark (English ship)	The Ark was a 17th century ship which carried passengers bound for the Maryland colony during the pioneering 1634 expedition. The settlers began a permanent settlement in a shared Indian village south of St. Clement's Island and named it St. Mary's. The Ark eventually returned to England leaving the Dove behind to provide transportation for goods to be traded up and down the Atlantic seacoast. The following year the Dove headed back to England but she never arrived and was presumed lost at sea.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Maryland_Tri_Cen_1934_Issue-3c.jpg/200px-Maryland_Tri_Cen_1934_Issue-3c.jpg
