207.0	Money	Money	Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment. Any kind of object or secure verifiable record that fulfills these functions can serve as money.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Euromoenterogsedler.jpg/220px-Euromoenterogsedler.jpg
