They were first mentioned in the Ẓiyāʾ-ud-Dīn Baranī (English: ) dated around 1356. In the 1830s they were targeted by William Bentinck, along with his chief captain William Henry Sleeman, for eradication. They were seemingly destroyed by this effort.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Group_of_Thugs.gif/200px-Group_of_Thugs.gif
