3.01	ITC_Benguiat	ITC Benguiat	ITC Benguiat is a decorative serif typeface designed by Ed Benguiat and released by the International Typeface Corporation (ITC) in 1978. The face is loosely based upon typefaces of the Art Nouveau period but is not considered an academic revival. The face follows ITC's design formulary of an extremely high x-height, combined with multiple widths and weights.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Benguiat.png
