The Commonwealth Games Federation accepts only athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations and recognises records set at editions of the Commonwealth Games. The athletics events at the Games are divided into four groups: track events (including sprints, middle- and long-distance running, hurdling and relays), field events (including javelin, discus, hammer, pole vault, long and triple jumps), road events and combined events (the triathlon, heptathlon and decathlon). There are also several track and field events held for disabled athletes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Commonwealth_Games_years_participants.PNG/300px-Commonwealth_Games_years_participants.PNG
