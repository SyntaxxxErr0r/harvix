3.21	First_rate	First-rate	First rate was the designation used by the Royal Navy for its largest ships of the line. While the size and establishment of guns and men changed over the 250 years that the rating system held sway, from the early years of the eighteenth century the first rates comprised those ships mounting 100 guns or more on three gundecks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Battleship1.jpg/200px-Battleship1.jpg
