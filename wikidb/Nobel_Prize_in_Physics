It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen, a German, "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays (or x-rays)." This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and widely regarded as the most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in physics. It is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Wilhelm_Conrad_R%C3%B6ntgen_%281845--1923%29.jpg/170px-Wilhelm_Conrad_R%C3%B6ntgen_%281845--1923%29.jpg
