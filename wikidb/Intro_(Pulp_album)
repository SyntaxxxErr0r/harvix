3.00	Intro_(Pulp_album)	Intro (Pulp album)	Intro â€“ The Gift Recordings is a compilation album by Pulp. It contains the band's three singles recorded for Gift Records and was released in October 1993. The version of "Babies" included here is the original single mix released in 1992, slightly different from the 1994 version available on the album His 'n' Hers. "Sheffield: Sex City" features a spoken vocal contribution from keyboardist Candida Doyle - reciting a selection from the book My Secret Garden by Nancy Friday - which is one of the few times her voice is audible on a Pulp song.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/PulpIntro.jpg/220px-PulpIntro.jpg
