84.1	Maneki_Neko	Maneki Neko	The Maneki Neko , literally "Beckoning Cat"; also known as Welcoming Cat, Lucky Cat, Money cat, or Fortune Cat) is a common Japanese sculpture, often made of ceramic, which is believed to bring good luck to the owner. The sculpture depicts a cat (traditionally a calico Japanese Bobtail) beckoning with an upright paw, and is usually displayed—many times at the entrance—in shops, restaurants, pachinko parlors, and other businesses. Some of the sculptures are electric or battery-powered and have a slow-moving paw beckoning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Maneki_neko_Germersheim_2.jpg/220px-Maneki_neko_Germersheim_2.jpg
