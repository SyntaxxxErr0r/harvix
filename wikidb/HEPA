84.2	HEPA	HEPA	High-Efficiency Particulate Air or HEPA is a type of air filter. Filters meeting the HEPA standard have many applications, including use in medical facilities, automobiles, aircraft, and homes. The filter must satisfy certain standards of efficiency such as those set by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). To qualify as HEPA by government standards, an air filter must remove 99.97% of all particles greater than 0.3 micrometer from the air that passes through. A filter that is qualified as HEPA is also subject to interior classifications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/HEPA_Filter_diagram_en.svg/300px-HEPA_Filter_diagram_en.svg.png
