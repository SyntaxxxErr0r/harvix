2.00	Unbehagen	Unbehagen	Unbehagen is the second and last album by the Nina Hagen Band before the solo career of singer Nina Hagen. The German title translates to Discomfort but can be seen as a pun on the band name. "Wenn ich ein Junge wär" was recorded live in April 1979 at the Saarbrücken Congress Hall.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Unbehagen.jpg/220px-Unbehagen.jpg
