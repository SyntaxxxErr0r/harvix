1.00	SIDstation	Elektron SidStation	The Elektron SidStation is a musical synthesizer sound module, built around the MOS Technology SID mixed-mode synthesizer chip originally used in the Commodore 64 home computer. It was produced by the Swedish synthesizer company Elektron, and was introduced in 1999. As the SID chip had not been manufactured for years, Elektron allegedly bought up nearly all the remaining stock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Sidstation.jpg/200px-Sidstation.jpg
