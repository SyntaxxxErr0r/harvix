116.4	Korean_language	Korean language	Korean (, see below) is the official language of South Korea and North Korea. It is also one of the two official languages in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in People's Republic of China. There are about 78 million Korean speakers worldwide. For over a millennium, Korean was written with adapted Chinese characters called hanja, complemented by phonetic systems like hyangchal, gugyeol, and idu. In the 15th century, a national writing system called hangul was commissioned by Sejong the Great, but it only came into widespread use in the 20th century, because of the yangban aristocracy's preference for hanja.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Hangugeo-Chosonmal.png/200px-Hangugeo-Chosonmal.png
