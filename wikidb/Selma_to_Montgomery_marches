77.0	Selma_to_Montgomery_marches	Selma to Montgomery marches	The Selma to Montgomery marches were three marches in 1965 that marked the political and emotional peak of the American civil rights movement. They grew out of the voting rights movement in Selma, Alabama, launched by local African-Americans who formed the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL). In 1963, the DCVL and organizers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) began voter-registration work. When white resistance to Black voter registration proved intractable, the DCVL requested the assistance of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who brought many prominent civil rights and civic leaders to support voting rights.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Bloody_Sunday-Alabama_police_attack.jpeg/240px-Bloody_Sunday-Alabama_police_attack.jpeg
