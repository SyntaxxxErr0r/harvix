54.9	Malt	Malt	Malt is germinated cereal grains that have been dried in a process known as "malting". The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air. Malting grains develops the enzymes required to modify the grain's starches into sugars, including monosaccharides such as glucose or fructose, and disaccharides, such as sucrose or maltose. It also develops other enzymes, such as proteases, which break down the proteins in the grain into forms that can be used by yeast.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Sjb_whiskey_malt.jpg/220px-Sjb_whiskey_malt.jpg
