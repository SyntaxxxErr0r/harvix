3.00	Abraham_ben_Abraham	Abraham ben Abraham	After residing a short time in Germany, a country he disliked, he returned to Poland, and for a time lived among the Jews of the town of Ilye , some of whom seemed to be aware of his identity. He has become close to the revered Gaon me'Vilna. When finally apprehended by the authorities, and placed in prison awaiting his death - it was decreed he would burn alive at the stake - the Vilna Gaon sent message offering to rescue him using Kabbala. Avraham ben Avraham refused, preferring instead to die 'al kiddush Hashem' and inquired of the Vilna Gaon which blessing he should make immediately before his passing. The Vilna Gaon answered "...M'Kadesh es Shimcha be'rabim" (who sanctifies His name in public) and sent an emissary to hear and answer "amen.". The entreaties of his mother and friends failed to induce him to return to Christianity; and after a long imprisonment and a trial for heresy he was burned alive in Vilna, on the second day of Shavuot. It was unsafe for a Jew to witness the burning; nevertheless one Jew, Leiser Zhiskes, who had no beard, went among the crowd and succeeded by bribery in securing some of the ashes of the martyr, which were later buried in the Jewish cemetery. A letter of pardon from the king arrived too late to save the victim.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Vilna_Gaon_portrait.gif
