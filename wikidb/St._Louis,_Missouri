149.8	St._Louis,_Missouri	St. Louis, Missouri	The city of St. Louis was founded in 1764 by Pierre Lacl√®de and Auguste Chouteau, and after the Louisiana Purchase, it became a major port on the Mississippi River. Its population expanded after the American Civil War, and it became the fourth-largest city in the United States in the late 19th century. It seceded from St. Louis County in March 1877, allowing it to become an independent city and limiting its political boundaries. In 1904, it hosted the 1904 World's Fair and the 1904 Olympic Games. The city's population peaked in 1950, after which began a long decline until the beginning of the 21st century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/StLouisMontage.jpg/275px-StLouisMontage.jpg
