1.00	Pachycephala_rufiventris	Rufous Whistler	The Rufous Whistler is a species of whistler found in New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, and throughout Australia (with the exception of Tasmania). Predominantly a reddish-brown and grey bird, it makes up for its subdued plumage with its song-making ability. Like many other members of the Pachycephalidae, it has a variety of musical calls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Rufous_whistler.jpg/220px-Rufous_whistler.jpg
