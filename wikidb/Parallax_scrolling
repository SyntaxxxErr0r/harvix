54.3	Parallax_scrolling	Parallax scrolling	Parallax scrolling is a special scrolling technique in computer graphics, wherein background images move by the camera slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D video game and adding to the immersion. The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1940s, and was popularized in the 1982 arcade game Moon Patrol.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Vg_graphics.svg/100px-Vg_graphics.svg.png
