125.5	Space_Shuttle_Challenger	Space Shuttle Challenger	Space Shuttle Challenger was NASA's second Space Shuttle orbiter to be put into service, Columbia having been the first. The shuttle was built by Rockwell International's Space Transportation Systems Division in Downey, California. Its maiden flight was on April 4, 1983, and it completed nine missions before breaking apart 73 seconds after the launch of its tenth mission, STS-51-L on January 28, 1986, resulting in the death of all seven crew members. The accident led to a two-and-a-half year grounding of the shuttle fleet, with missions resuming in 1988 with the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery on STS-26. Challenger itself was replaced by the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which first launched in 1992. Endeavour was constructed from spare parts originally meant for Challenger and the other shuttles in the fleet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_lands_for_the_first_time%2C_completing_STS-6._.jpg/200px-Space_Shuttle_Challenger_lands_for_the_first_time%2C_completing_STS-6._.jpg
