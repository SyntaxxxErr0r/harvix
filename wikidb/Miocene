76.1	Miocene	Miocene	The Miocene (symbol MI) is a geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (, “less”) and (, “new”) and means "less recent" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch. The Miocene is the first epoch of the Neogene Period.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Neogene-MioceneGlobal.jpg/300px-Neogene-MioceneGlobal.jpg
