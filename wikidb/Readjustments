1.00	Readjustments	Readjuster Party	The Readjuster Party was a political coalition formed in Virginia in the late 1870s during the turbulent period following the American Civil War. Readjusters aspired "to break the power of wealth and established privilege" and to promote public education, a program which attracted biracial support. The party was led by Harrison H. Riddleberger of Woodstock, an attorney, and William Mahone, a former Confederate general who was president of several railroads. Mahone was a controlling force in Virginia politics from around 1870 until 1883, when his party, the "Readjusters", lost control to the "Conservative Democrats".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/SouthSideRailroadDepotPetersburgVA.JPG/220px-SouthSideRailroadDepotPetersburgVA.JPG
