57.7	Composting_toilet	Composting toilet	A composting toilet is a dry toilet that uses a predominantly aerobic processing system that treats excreta, typically with no water or small volumes of flush water, via composting or managed aerobic decomposition. Composting toilets may be used as an alternative to flush toilets in situations where there is no suitable water supply or waste treatment facility available or to capture nutrients in human excreta as humanure. They are in use in many of the roadside facilities in Sweden, in National Parks both in the United States and the United Kingdom.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Compostingtoilet.jpg/220px-Compostingtoilet.jpg
