The importance that viticulture had in ancient Greek society can be seen in a quote from the Greek historian Thucydides: "the peoples of the Mediterranean began to emerge from barbarism when they learned to cultivate the olive and the vine".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Location_greek_ancient.png
