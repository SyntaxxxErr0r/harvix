65.5	Domain_hack	Domain hack	A domain hack is an unconventional domain name that combines domain levels, especially the top-level domain (TLD), to spell out the full "name" or title of the domain. Examples include del.icio.us , goo.gl (http://goo.gl/) and fold.it (http://fold.it/). In this context, the word hack denotes a trick (as in programming), not an exploit or break-in (as in security).
