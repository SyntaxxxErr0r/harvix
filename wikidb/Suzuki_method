57.4	Suzuki_method	Suzuki method	The Suzuki method (Suzuki movement) is a method of teaching music conceived by Japanese violinist Shin'ichi Suzuki that emerged in the mid-20th century. The central belief of Suzuki, based on his language acquisition theories, is that all people are capable of learning from their environment. The essential components of his method spring from the desire to create the "right environment" for learning music. He also believed that this positive environment would also help to foster character in students.
