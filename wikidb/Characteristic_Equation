1.00	Characteristic_Equation	Characteristic equation (calculus)	Solving the characteristic equation for its roots, , allows one to find the general solution of the differential equation. The roots may be real and/or complex, as well as distinct and/or repeated. If a characteristic equation has parts with distinct real roots, repeated roots, and/or complex roots corresponding to general solutions of , , and , respectively, then the general solution to the differential equation is
