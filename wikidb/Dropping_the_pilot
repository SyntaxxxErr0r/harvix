1.23	Dropping_the_pilot	Dropping the Pilot	Dropping the Pilot is a political cartoon by Sir John Tenniel, first published in the British magazine Punch, March 1890. It depicts Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as a maritime pilot, stepping off a ship (perhaps a reference to Plato's ship of state), watched by the German Emperor Wilhelm II. Bismarck had just resigned as Chancellor at Wilhelm's insistence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/1890_Bismarcks_Ruecktritt.jpg/250px-1890_Bismarcks_Ruecktritt.jpg
