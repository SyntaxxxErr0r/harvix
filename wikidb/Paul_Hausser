Battling in both the Eastern and Western fronts of World War II, he was seriously wounded twice, losing an eye in the first incident. After the war he became a member of the HIAG which sought to rehabilitate the reputation and legal status of the Waffen-SS.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/Hausser.jpg/220px-Hausser.jpg
