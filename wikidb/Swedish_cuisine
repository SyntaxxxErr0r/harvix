30.53	Swedish_cuisine	Swedish cuisine	Due to Sweden's large north-south expanse there have always been regional differences in Swedish cuisine. Historically, in the far North, meats such as reindeer, and other (semi-) game dishes were eaten, some of which have their roots in the Sami culture, while fresh vegetables have played a larger role in the South. Many traditional dishes employ simple, contrasting flavours, such as the traditional dish of hearty meatballs and gravy with tart, pungent lingonberry jam (slightly similar in taste to cranberry sauce).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Flag_of_Sweden.svg/150px-Flag_of_Sweden.svg.png
