55.8	Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe	Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe	The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe – also known as the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), and Explorer 80 – is a spacecraft which measures differences in the temperature of the Big Bang's remnant radiant heat – the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation – across the full sky. Headed by Professor Charles L. Bennett, Johns Hopkins University, the mission was developed in a joint partnership between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University. The WMAP spacecraft was launched on June 30, 2001, at 19:46:46 GDT, from Florida. The WMAP mission succeeds the COBE space mission and was the second medium-class (MIDEX) spacecraft of the Explorer program. In 2003, MAP was renamed WMAP in honor of cosmologist David Todd Wilkinson (1935–2002), who had been a member of the mission's science team.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/WMAP_collage.jpg/230px-WMAP_collage.jpg
