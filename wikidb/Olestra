55.75	Olestra	Olestra	Olestra (also known by its brand name Olean) is a fat substitute that adds no fat, calories, or cholesterol to products. It has been used in the preparation of traditionally high-fat foods such as potato chips, thereby lowering or eliminating their fat content. In the late 1990s, Olestra lost its popularity due to side effects, but products containing the ingredient can still be purchased at grocery stores.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Olestra_stereo_animation.gif/300px-Olestra_stereo_animation.gif
