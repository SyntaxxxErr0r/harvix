1.00	Via_Negativa	Apophatic theology	Apophatic theology (from Greek ἀπόφασις from ἀπόφημι - apophēmi, "to deny")—also known as negative theology or via negativa (Latin for "negative way")—is a theology that attempts to describe God, the Divine Good, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God. It stands in contrast with cataphatic theology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Benozzo_Gozzoli_004a.jpg/100px-Benozzo_Gozzoli_004a.jpg
