114.6	Holocene	Holocene	The Holocene is a geological epoch which began at the end of the Pleistocene (around 12,000 14C years ago) and continues to the present. The Holocene is part of the Quaternary period. Its name comes from the Greek words (holos, whole or entire) and (kainos, new), meaning "entirely recent". It has been identified with the current warm period, known as MIS 1 and based on that past evidence, can be considered an interglacial in the current ice age.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/VeyoVolcano.jpg/220px-VeyoVolcano.jpg
