103.1	Christopher_Wren	Christopher Wren	Sir Christopher Wren FRS (20 October 1632 â€“ 25 February 1723) is one of the most highly acclaimed English architects in history. He used to be accorded responsibility for rebuilding 51 churches in the City of London after the Great Fire in 1666, including his masterpiece, St. Paul's Cathedral, on Ludgate Hill, completed in 1710. The principal creative responsibility for a number of the churches is now more commonly attributed to others in his office, especially Nicholas Hawksmoor. Other notable buildings by Wren include the Royal Naval College in Greenwich and the south front of Hampton Court Palace.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Christopher_Wren_by_Godfrey_Kneller_1711.jpg/180px-Christopher_Wren_by_Godfrey_Kneller_1711.jpg
