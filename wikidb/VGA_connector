84.1	VGA_connector	VGA connector	A Video Graphics Array (VGA) connector is a three-row 15-pin DE-15 connector. The 15-pin VGA connector is found on many video cards, computer monitors, and some high definition television sets. On laptop computers or other small devices, a mini-VGA port is sometimes used in place of the full-sized VGA connector.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/DE15_Connector_Pinout.svg/300px-DE15_Connector_Pinout.svg.png
