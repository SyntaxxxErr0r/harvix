55.1	YFZ_Ranch	YFZ Ranch	The YFZ Ranch, also known as the Yearning for Zion Ranch, is a 1,700-acre (7 km2) community which housed as many as 700 people just outside of Eldorado in Schleicher County, Texas, United States. It is owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS). It is about 45 miles (72 km) southwest of San Angelo and 4 miles (6 km) northeast of Eldorado. The Ranch was settled by members of the FLDS Church who left Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona under increasing scrutiny from the media, anti-polygamy activists and law enforcement officials.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/FLDS_Eldorado_hi.jpg/300px-FLDS_Eldorado_hi.jpg
