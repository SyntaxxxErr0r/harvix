59.6	Automation	Automation	Automation is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/KUKA_robot_for_flat_glas_handling.jpg/169px-KUKA_robot_for_flat_glas_handling.jpg
