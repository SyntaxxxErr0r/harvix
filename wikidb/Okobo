7.21	Okobo	Okobo	Okobo ), also referred to as pokkuri, bokkuri, or koppori geta from the sound made when walking, are wooden sandals worn by maiko (apprentice geisha) during their apprenticeship. Okobo are very tall and usually made from a block of willow wood. Usually, the wood has either no finish or a natural finish, but during the summer months, maiko will wear black-lacquered okobo. They are held to the foot by simple thong-like straps in colors that represent their maiko status. Red straps are worn by new maiko, while yellow ones are worn by those who have nearly completed their apprenticeship. Okobo are worn to prevent the wearer's kimono from touching the ground.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/Okobo.JPG/200px-Okobo.JPG
