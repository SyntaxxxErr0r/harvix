6.02	External_gills	External gills	This type of gill is most commonly observed on the aquatic larva of most species of salamanders, lungfish, and bichirs (which have only one large pair), and are retained by neotenic adult salamanders and some species of adult lungfish. They are present on non-transforming salamander species such as the mudpuppy, as well as most members of the Proteidae and Sirenidae families, which naturally never metamorphose into an air-breathing form. The embryos of frogs and caecilians also develop external gills at some point in their development, though these are either resorbed before or disappear shortly after hatching. Fossils of the distant relatives of modern amphibians, such as Branchiosaurus and Apateon, also show evidence of external gills.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Axolotl_Portrait.jpg/200px-Axolotl_Portrait.jpg
