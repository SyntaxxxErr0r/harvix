10.10	Consumer_lending	Credit (finance)	Credit is the trust which allows one party to provide resources to another party where that second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but instead arranges either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date. The resources provided may be financial (e.g. granting a loan), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g. consumer credit). Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment. Credit is extended by a creditor, also known as a lender, to a debtor, also known as a borrower.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/2005private_sector_credit.PNG/300px-2005private_sector_credit.PNG
