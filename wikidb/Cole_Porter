103.6	Cole_Porter	Cole Porter	Cole Albert Porter (June 9, 1891 â€“ October 15, 1964) was an American composer and songwriter. Born to a wealthy family in Indiana, he defied the wishes of his domineering grandfather and took up music as a profession. Classically trained, he was drawn towards musical theatre. After a slow start, he began to achieve success in the 1920s, and by the 1930s he was one of the major songwriters for the Broadway musical stage. Unlike most successful Broadway composers, Porter wrote both the lyrics and the music for his songs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Coleporter.jpg/200px-Coleporter.jpg
