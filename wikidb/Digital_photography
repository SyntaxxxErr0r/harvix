95.3	Digital_photography	Digital photography	Digital photography is a form of photography that uses an array of light sensitive sensors to capture the image focused by the lens, as opposed to an exposure on light sensitive film. The captured image is then stored as a digital file ready for digital processing (colour correction, sizing, cropping, etc.), viewing or printing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/D700-400.jpg/220px-D700-400.jpg
