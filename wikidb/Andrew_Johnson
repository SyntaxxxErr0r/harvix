99.7	Andrew_Johnson	Andrew Johnson	Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808 – July 31, 1875) was the 17th President of the United States (1865–1869). As Vice President of the United States in 1865, he succeeded Abraham Lincoln following the latter's assassination. Johnson then presided over the initial and contentious Reconstruction era of the United States following the American Civil War. Johnson's reconstruction policies failed to promote the rights of the Freedmen, and he came under vigorous political attack from Republicans, ending in his impeachment by the U.S. House of Representatives, though it failed in the U.S. Senate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/16_Andrew_Johnson_3x4-Edit1.jpg/220px-16_Andrew_Johnson_3x4-Edit1.jpg
