1.00	Crux_Gemmata	Crux gemmata	A crux gemmata (Latin for "jewelled cross") is a form of cross typical of Early Christian and Early Medieval art, where the cross, or at least its front side, is principally decorated with jewels. In an actual cross, rather than a painted image of one, the reverse side often has engraved images of the Crucifixion of Jesus or other subjects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Cross_classe.jpg/220px-Cross_classe.jpg
