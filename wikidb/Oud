72.4	Oud	Oud	The Oud (Arabic: ‎ ʿūd, plural:أعواد, a‘wād; Assyrian:ܥܘܕ ūd, Greek: ; Persian: ‎ barbat; Turkish: ; Armenian: , Azeri: ud; Hebrew: ‎; Somali: or kaban) is a pear-shaped stringed instrument commonly used in North African and Middle Eastern music, mainly in countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as well as the UAE. The modern oud and the European lute both descend from a common ancestor via diverging paths. The oud is readily distinguished by its lack of frets and smaller neck.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Oud.jpg/150px-Oud.jpg
