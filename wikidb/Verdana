51.1	Verdana	Verdana	Verdana is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Matthew Carter for Microsoft Corporation, with hand-hinting done by Thomas Rickner, then at Monotype. Demand for such a typeface was recognized by Virginia Howlett of Microsoft's typography group. The name "Verdana" is based on a portmanteau of verdant (something green), and Ana (the name of Howlett's eldest daughter).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/VerdanaSpecimen.svg/220px-VerdanaSpecimen.svg.png
