2.02	Fab_region	Fragment antigen-binding	The fragment antigen-binding is a region on an antibody that binds to antigens. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain of each of the heavy and the light chain. These domains shape the paratope — the antigen-binding site — at the amino terminal end of the monomer. The two variable domains bind the epitope on their specific antigens.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/2fab_fc.svg/200px-2fab_fc.svg.png
