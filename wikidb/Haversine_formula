54.9	Haversine_formula	Haversine formula	In order to obtain the haversine formula of the previous section from this law, one simply considers the special case where u is the north pole, while v and w are the two points whose separation d is to be determined. In that case, a and b are π/2 − φ1,2 (i.e., 90° − latitude), C is the longitude separation Δλ, and c is the desired d/R. Noting that sin = cos(φ), the haversine formula immediately follows.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Law-of-haversines.svg/220px-Law-of-haversines.svg.png
