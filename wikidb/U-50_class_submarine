1.00	U-50_class_submarine	U-50 class submarine	The U-50 class was a class of four ocean-going submarines or U-boats planned for the Austro-Hungarian Navy (German: ) during World War I. The design of the boats was based on the Project 835 design purchased from the German firm of Germaniawerft in July 1915. The Navy authorized Ganz Danubius to begin construction of the submarines in Fiume in February 1916. Only two of the planned four boats were laid down, but neither were ever launched or completed. The two incomplete submarines were scrapped after the war ended.
