3.00	Four_Passing_Sights	Four sights	The four sights were specific observations made by Prince SiddhƒÅrtha (who later became Gautama Buddha), which led to a realization. Before this, he had been confined to his palace by his father, who feared that he would become an ascetic if he came into contact with sufferings of life according to a prediction. However, on his first venture out of the palace with his charioteer Channa, he observed four sights; an old man, a sick man, a corpse and an ascetic. These observations affected him deeply and made him realize the sufferings of all beings, and compelled him to begin his spiritual journey which led into his enlightenment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Four_Heavenly_Messengers.jpg/220px-Four_Heavenly_Messengers.jpg
