1.00	This_is_our_country	Freedom's Road	Freedom's Road is an album by American singer-songwriter and musician John Mellencamp, released in 2007. It debuted on the Billboard 200 at number five in late January 2007, becoming the highest debuting album of Mellencamp's career. The song "Our Country" received significant exposure prior to the release of the album, as it was featured in frequently-aired commercials for Chevrolet trucks. The country band Little Big Town provides background vocals on eight songs on the album, including "Our Country." Mellencamp intended for Freedom's Road to have a 1960s rock sound while still remaining contemporary, and he feels that goal was achieved. "We wanted to make sure that it had the same feeling of some of the great songs from the '60s but also had the message of today and had the backbeat of today. I think we came up with a pretty timeless sounding album," Mellencamp told his online radio station in late 2006.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Freedom%27s_road.JPG/220px-Freedom%27s_road.JPG
