62.6	Mirror_neurons	Mirror neuron	A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another. Thus, the neuron "mirrors" the behaviour of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate and other species including birds. In humans, brain activity consistent with that of mirror neurons has been found in the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the primary somatosensory cortex and the inferior parietal cortex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Makak_neonatal_imitation.png/300px-Makak_neonatal_imitation.png
