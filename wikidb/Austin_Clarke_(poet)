He also wrote plays, novels and memoirs. Clarke's main contribution to Irish poetry was the rigour with which he used technical means borrowed from classical Irish language poetry when writing in English.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Austin_Clarke_Bridge%2C_Templeogue_-_geograph.org.uk_-_447177.jpg/300px-Austin_Clarke_Bridge%2C_Templeogue_-_geograph.org.uk_-_447177.jpg
