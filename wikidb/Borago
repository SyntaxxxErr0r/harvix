4.10	Borago	Borago	Borago , common name borage, is a genus of two species of herbs with large, hairy leaves that taste mildly of cucumber, and star-shaped purple-blue flowers which are prized for their flavour. The leaves are often added to teas and salads, and the flowers have been added to wine (Borage has had a reputation to give one courage since Roman times). The flowers are highly attractive to bees.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Borage-flower-hr.jpg/220px-Borage-flower-hr.jpg
