134.1	Pseudoscience	Pseudoscience	Pseudoscience is a claim, belief, or practice which is presented as scientific, but does not adhere to a valid scientific method, lacks supporting evidence or plausibility, cannot be reliably tested, or otherwise lacks scientific status. Pseudoscience is often characterized by the use of vague, exaggerated or unprovable claims, an over-reliance on confirmation rather than rigorous attempts at refutation, a lack of openness to evaluation by other experts, and a general absence of systematic processes to rationally develop theories.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/PrirodneNauke.svg/100px-PrirodneNauke.svg.png
