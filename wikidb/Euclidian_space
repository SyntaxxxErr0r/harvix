1.10	Euclidian_space	Euclidean space	In mathematics, Euclidean space is the Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, as well as the generalizations of these notions to higher dimensions. The term “Euclidean” distinguishes these spaces from the curved spaces of non-Euclidean geometry and Einstein's general theory of relativity, and is named for the Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Coord_system_CA_0.svg/250px-Coord_system_CA_0.svg.png
