Anyone who has edited is known as a "Wikipedian" and, no matter how trivial the edit may seem, can be proud that he or she has helped make Wikipedia what it is. All of these edits add up!	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/How_to_edit_a_page_Edit_box.png/600px-How_to_edit_a_page_Edit_box.png
