59.2	Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna	Antonio López de Santa Anna	Antonio de Padua María Severino López de Santa Anna y Pérez de Lebrón (21 February 1794 – 21 June 1876), often known as Santa Anna or López de Santa Anna and sometimes also "the Napoleon of the West," was a Mexican political leader, general, and president who greatly influenced early Mexican and Spanish politics and government. Santa Anna fought first against Mexican independence from Spain, then in support of it. Though not the first caudillo (military leader) of Mexico, he was among the earliest. He held the rank of general and/or the office of president (or both concurrently) at various times over a turbulent 40-year career; he was president of Mexico on eleven non-consecutive occasions over a period of 22 years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_c1853.png/220px-Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_c1853.png
