84.5	Personas	Persona	A persona, in the word's everyday usage, is a social role or a character played by an actor. The word is derived from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The Latin word probably derived from the Etruscan word "phersu", with the same meaning, and that from the Greek πρόσωπον . Its meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a "character" of a theatrical performance or court of law, when it became apparent that different individuals could assume the same role, and legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role, and that the same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Guatemala-Mask.jpg/300px-Guatemala-Mask.jpg
