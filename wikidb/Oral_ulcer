10.63	Oral_ulcer	Mouth ulcer	A mouth or oral ulcer (, from Latin ulcus and that from Greek "ἕλκος" - elkos, "wound") is an open sore in the mouth, or rarely a break in the mucous membrane or the epithelium on the lips or surrounding the mouth. The types of mouth ulcers are diverse, with a multitude of associated causes including: physical abrasion, acidic fruit, infection, other medical conditions, medications, and cancerous and nonspecific processes. Once formed, the ulcer may be maintained by inflammation and/or secondary infection. Two common types are aphthous ulcers ("canker sores") and cold sores . Cold sores around the lip are caused by viruses.
