72.9	A-18_Hornet	McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet	The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) F/A-18 Hornet is a twin-engine supersonic, all-weather carrier-capable multirole fighter jet, designed to dogfight and attack ground targets (F/A for Fighter/Attack). Designed by McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, the F/A-18 was derived from the latter's YF-17 in the 1970s for use by the United States Navy and Marine Corps. The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations. It has been the aerial demonstration aircraft for the U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, since 1986.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/USMC_FA-18_Hornet.JPEG/300px-USMC_FA-18_Hornet.JPEG
