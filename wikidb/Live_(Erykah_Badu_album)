8.21	Live_(Erykah_Badu_album)	Live (Erykah Badu album)	Live is a live concert album by American R&amp;B singer Erykah Badu, released in 1997 (see 1997 in music). Apparent throughout Live is the raw emotion that Badu shows when performing. An example of the emotion delivered in the album can be identified with the song Ye Yo where Badu, pregnant, can be heard crying while delivering a powerful performance dedicated to her son, Seven (although at the time of the recording, apparently the fetus' gender had yet to be determined because she refers to the baby in the feminine sense, seemingly assuming the gender would be female). Released in the fall of 1997, with her debut album Baduizm released earlier that year, Live quickly went double platinum with the radio hit Tyrone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cc/Erykah_Badu_-_Live.jpg
