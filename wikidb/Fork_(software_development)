214.2	Fork_(software_development)	Fork (software development)	In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but a split in the developer community, a form of schism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Gldt.svg/220px-Gldt.svg.png
