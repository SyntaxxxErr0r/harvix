1.01	Maloca	Maloca	A maloca is an ancestral long house used by the natives of the Amazon, notably in Colombia and Brazil. Each community has a maloca with its own unique characteristics. For many years, these long houses were Jesuit missionariesâ€™ objects of attack. Several families with patrilineal relations live together in a maloca, distributed around the long house in different compartments. In general, the chief of the local descent group lives in the compartment nearest to the back wall of the long house. As well, each family has its own furnace.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Maloca.jpg/220px-Maloca.jpg
