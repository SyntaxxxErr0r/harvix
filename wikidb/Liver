135.29	Liver	Liver	The liver is a vital organ present in vertebrates and some other animals. It has a wide range of functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. The liver is necessary for survival; there is currently no way to compensate for the absence of liver function long term, although liver dialysis can be used short term.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Leber_Schaf.jpg/240px-Leber_Schaf.jpg
