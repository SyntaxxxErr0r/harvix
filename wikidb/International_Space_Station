323.9	International_Space_Station	International Space Station	The International Space Station is a habitable artificial satellite in low Earth orbit. It follows the Salyut, Almaz, Skylab and Mir stations as the ninth space station to be inhabited. The ISS is a modular structure whose first component was launched in 1998. Like many artificial satellites, the station can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other elements. ISS components have been launched by American Space Shuttles as well as Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets. Budget constraints led to the merger of three space station projects with the Japanese Kib≈ç module and Canadian robotics. In 1993 the Soviet/Russian Mir-2, the American Freedom, and the European Columbus, merged into a single multi-national programme. The Russian Federal Space Agency plans to separate some of its modules from the Russian segment to form the OPSEK facility before the remainder of the station is deorbited.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/STS-135_final_flyaround_of_ISS_1.jpg/240px-STS-135_final_flyaround_of_ISS_1.jpg
