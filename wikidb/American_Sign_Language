88.5	American_Sign_Language	American Sign Language	American Sign Language is a complex form of manual communication in which hands, limbs, head, facial expression and body language are used to communicate a visual-spatial language without sound. ASL is not related to spoken English, and features an entirely different grammar and vocabulary: linguistically it is a complete, natural and fully realized language in its own right.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/ILY_sign.jpg/100px-ILY_sign.jpg
