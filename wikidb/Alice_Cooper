109.5	Alice_Cooper	Alice Cooper	Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier; February 4, 1948) is an American rock singer, songwriter, and musician whose career spans more than four decades. With a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, boa constrictors and baby dolls, Cooper has drawn equally from horror movies, vaudeville and garage rock to pioneer a grandly theatrical and violent brand of heavy metal designed to shock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Cooper%2C_Alice_%282007%29.jpg/220px-Cooper%2C_Alice_%282007%29.jpg
