6.01	YAG	Yttrium aluminium garnet	Yttrium aluminium garnet is a synthetic crystalline material of the garnet group. It is also one of three phases of the yttria-aluminium composite, the other two being yttrium aluminium monoclinic (YAM) and yttrium aluminium perovskite (YAP). YAG is commonly used as a host material in various solid-state lasers. Rare earth elements such as neodymium and erbium can be doped into YAG as active laser ions, yielding Nd:YAG and Er:YAG lasers, respectively. Cerium-doped YAG (YAG:Ce) is used as a phosphor in cathode ray tubes and white light-emitting diodes, and as a scintillator.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Yag-rod.jpg/220px-Yag-rod.jpg
