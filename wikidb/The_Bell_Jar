The novel is semi-autobiographical with the names of places and people changed. The book is often regarded as a roman Ã  clef, with the protagonist's descent into mental illness paralleling Plath's own experiences with what may have been clinical depression. Plath committed suicide a month after its first UK publication. The novel was published under Plath's name for the first time in 1967 and was not published in the United States until 1971, pursuant to the wishes of Plath's husband Ted Hughes and her mother.The novel has been translated into nearly a dozen languages	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Belljarfirstedition.jpg/200px-Belljarfirstedition.jpg
