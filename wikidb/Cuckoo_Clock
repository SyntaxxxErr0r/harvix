2.00	Cuckoo_Clock	Cuckoo clock	A cuckoo clock is a clock, typically pendulum-regulated, that strikes the hours with a sound like a common cuckoo's call and typically has a mechanical cuckoo that emerges with each note. The mechanism to produce the cuckoo call was installed in almost every kind of cuckoo clock since the middle of the 18th century and has remained almost without variation until the present.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Du200613.gif/180px-Du200613.gif
