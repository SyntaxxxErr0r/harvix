7.41	Calcium_deficiency_(plant_disorder)	Calcium deficiency (plant disorder)	Calcium (Ca) deficiency is a plant disorder that can be caused by insufficient calcium in the growing medium, but is more frequently a product of low transpiration of the whole plant or more commonly the affected tissue. Plants are susceptible to such localized calcium deficiencies in low or nontranspiring tissues because calcium is not transported in the phloem. This may be due to water shortages, which slow the transportation of calcium to the plant, or can be caused by excessive usage of potassium or nitrogen fertilizers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Blossom_end_rot.JPG/220px-Blossom_end_rot.JPG
