4.01	Malbot	Internet bot	Internet bots, also known as web robots, WWW robots or simply bots, are software applications that run automated tasks over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone. The largest use of bots is in web spidering, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human. Each server can have a file called robots.txt, containing rules for the spidering of that server that the bot is supposed to obey.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Automated_online_assistant.png/170px-Automated_online_assistant.png
