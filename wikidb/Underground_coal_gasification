21.24	Underground_coal_gasification	Underground coal gasification	Underground coal gasification (UCG) is an industrial process, which converts coal into product gas. UCG is an in-situ gasification process carried out in non-mined coal seams using injection of oxidants, and bringing the product gas to surface through production wells drilled from the surface. The product gas could to be used as a chemical feedstock or as fuel for power generation. The technique can be applied to resources that are otherwise unprofitable or technically complicated to extract by traditional mining methods, and it also offers an alternative to conventional coal mining methods for some resources.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/UCGprocessfigure-01.png/220px-UCGprocessfigure-01.png
