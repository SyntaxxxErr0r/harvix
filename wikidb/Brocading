1.00	Brocading	Brocade	Brocade is a class of richly decorative shuttle-woven fabrics, often made in colored silks and with or without gold and silver threads. The name, related to the same root as the word "broccoli," comes from Italian broccato meaning "embossed cloth," originally past participle of the verb broccare "to stud, set with nails," from brocco, "small nail," from Latin broccus, "projecting, pointed."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Brocart_de_soie_fran%C3%A7ais.jpg/220px-Brocart_de_soie_fran%C3%A7ais.jpg
