63.1	The_Hollow_Men	The Hollow Men	The Hollow Men is a poem by T. S. Eliot. Its themes are, like many of Eliot's poems, overlapping and fragmentary, but it is recognised to be concerned most with post-World War I Europe under the Treaty of Versailles (which Eliot despised: compare "Gerontion"), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, and, as some critics argue, Eliot's own failed marriage (Vivienne Eliot may have been having an affair with Bertrand Russell). The poem is divided into five parts and consists of 98 lines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/T_S_Eliot_Simon_Fieldhouse.jpg/200px-T_S_Eliot_Simon_Fieldhouse.jpg
