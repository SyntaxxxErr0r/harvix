1.10	Ebbinghaus_Illusion	Ebbinghaus illusion	The Ebbinghaus illusion or Titchener circles is an optical illusion of relative size perception. In the best-known version of the illusion, two circles of identical size are placed near to each other and one is surrounded by large circles while the other is surrounded by small circles; the first central circle then appears smaller than the second central circle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Mond-vergleich.svg/240px-Mond-vergleich.svg.png
