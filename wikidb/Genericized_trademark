78.1	Genericized_trademark	Generic trademark	A generic trademark, also known as a genericized trademark or proprietary eponym, is a trademark or brand name that has become the colloquial or generic description for, or synonymous with, a general class of product or service, rather than as an indicator of source or affiliation ("secondary meaning") as intended by the trademark's holder. Using a genericized trademark to refer to the general form of what that trademark represents is a form of metonymy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Jello_sign.jpg/220px-Jello_sign.jpg
