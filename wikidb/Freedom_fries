89.6	Freedom_fries	Freedom fries	Freedom fries is a political euphemism for French fries used by some people in the United States as a result of anti-French sentiment during the controversy over the U.S. decision to launch the 2003 invasion of Iraq. France expressed strong opposition in the United Nations to such an invasion. Some frowned upon the French position, leading to campaigns for the boycotting of French goods and businesses and the removal of the country's name from products.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Freedom-Fries-Menu.jpg/240px-Freedom-Fries-Menu.jpg
