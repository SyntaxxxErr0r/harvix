1.01	Darnaway_Castle	Darnaway Castle	Darnaway Castle is located in Darnaway Forest, 3 miles (4.8 km) southwest of Forres in Moray, Scotland. This was Comyn land, given to Thomas Randolph along with the Earldom of Moray by King Robert I. The castle has remained the seat of the Earls of Moray ever since. Rebuilt in 1810, it retains the old banquenting hall, capable of accommodating 1,000 men. The hall is the only remaining portion of the castle that was erected in 1450 by Archibald Douglas, Earl of Moray, and retains its 15th-century hammerbeam roof, making it one of only two medieval halls in Scotland with its original roof, "a specimen almost unique in Scotland." The hall was already notable in 1562 when an English observer described it as, "verie fayer and large builded."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Darnaway_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_13190.jpg/220px-Darnaway_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_13190.jpg
