2.10	Market_Square_(Lviv)	Market Square (Lviv)	The Rynok Square in Lviv (Ukrainian: , Polish: ) is a central square of the city of Lviv, Ukraine. It was planned in the second half of the 14th century, following granting city rights by Polish king Casimir III, who annexed Red Ruthenia. The king ordered Lviv to be moved more to the south, where a new city was built to the plan of a traditional European settlement: a central square surrounded by living quarters and fortifications. Old, Ruthenian Lviv had become a suburb of the new city.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Lw%C3%B3w_-_Rynek_01.JPG/200px-Lw%C3%B3w_-_Rynek_01.JPG
