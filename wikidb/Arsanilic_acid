1.00	Arsanilic_acid	Arsanilic acid	Arsanilic acid is the organoarsenic compound also called p-aminophenylarsonic acid. This colourless solid was used as a drug in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but is now considered prohibitively toxic. Arsanilic acid is a derivative of phenylarsonic acid with an amine in the 4-position. It exists as a zwitterion, H3N+C6H4AsO3Hâˆ’, although it is typically represented with the non-zwitterionic formula, H2NC6H4AsO3H2.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/ArsenilicEquilNewArrow.png/300px-ArsenilicEquilNewArrow.png
