4.11	Double_bottom	Double bottom	A double bottom is a ship hull design and construction method where the bottom of the ship has two complete layers of watertight hull surface: one outer layer forming the normal hull of the ship, and a second inner hull which is somewhat higher in the ship, perhaps a few feet, which forms a redundant barrier to seawater in case the outer hull is damaged and leaks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/DoubleBottomDoubleHull.png/200px-DoubleBottomDoubleHull.png
