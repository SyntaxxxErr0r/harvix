3.12	Methylenedioxy	Methylenedioxy	Methylenedioxy is the term used in the field of chemistry, particularly in organic chemistry, for a functional group with the structural formula R-O-CH2-O-R' which is connected to the rest of a molecule by two chemical bonds. The methylenedioxy group consists of two oxygen atoms connected to a methylene (CH2) group. The methylenedioxy group is generally found attached to an aromatic structure such as phenyl where it forms the methylenedioxyphenyl or benzodioxole functional group which is widely found in natural products, including safrole, and drugs and chemicals such as tadalafil, MDMA, and piperonyl butoxide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Methylenedioxy_skeletal.svg/200px-Methylenedioxy_skeletal.svg.png
