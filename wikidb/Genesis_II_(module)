4.00	Genesis_II_(module)	Genesis II	Genesis II is the second experimental space habitat designed and built by the private American firm Bigelow Aerospace, and was launched in 2007. As the second module sent into orbit by the company, this spacecraft builds on the data and experience gleaned from its previously orbited sister-ship Genesis I to continue testing the long-term viability of expandable space structures. Like its sister-ship and other modules being designed by Bigelow Aerospace, this spacecraft is based on the NASA TransHab design, which provides increased interior volume and reduced launch diameter along with potentially reduced mass compared to traditional rigid structures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Genesis_rendering.jpg/240px-Genesis_rendering.jpg
