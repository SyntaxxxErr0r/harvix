3.10	Touch-tone	Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling	Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling is used for telecommunication signaling over analog telephone lines in the voice-frequency band between telephone handsets and other communications devices and the switching center. The version of DTMF that is used in push-button telephones for tone dialing is known as Touch-Tone. It was developed by Western Electric and first used by the Bell System in commerce, using that name as a registered trademark. DTMF is standardized by ITU-T Recommendation Q.23. It is also known in the UK as MF4.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/66a3aDTMFpad.jpg/220px-66a3aDTMFpad.jpg
