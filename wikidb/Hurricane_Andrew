78.0	Hurricane_Andrew	Hurricane Andrew	Hurricane Andrew was a long-lived, destructive, classical, and very powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season and was the third Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the United States, after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Camille in 1969. Andrew was the first named storm and only major hurricane of the otherwise inactive 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. During Andrew's duration it struck the northwestern Bahamas, southern Florida at Homestead (south of Miami), and southwest Louisiana around Morgan City in August. Andrew caused $26.5 billion in damage (1992 USD, $43.9 billion 2012 USD), with most of that damage cost in south Florida, which it struck at Category 5 strength; however, other sources estimated the total cost between $27 billion (1992 USD, $44.7 billion 2012 USD) and $34 billion (1992 USD, $49.7 billion 2012 USD). Its central pressure ranks as the fourth-lowest in U.S. landfall records. Andrew was the costliest Atlantic hurricane in U.S. history prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. It was also surpassed by Hurricane Ike in 2008.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Andrew_23_aug_1992_1231Z.jpg/220px-Andrew_23_aug_1992_1231Z.jpg
