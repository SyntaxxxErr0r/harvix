1.00	Amon_Wilds	Amon Wilds	Amon Wilds (1762–12 September 1833) was an English architect and builder. He formed an architectural partnership with his son Amon Henry Wildsnote 1 in 1806 and started working in the fashionable and growing seaside resort of Brighton, on the East Sussex coast, in 1815. After 1822, when the father-and-son partnership met and joined up with Charles Busby, they were commissioned—separately or jointly—to design a wide range of buildings in the town, which was experiencing an unprecedented demand for residential development and other facilities. Wilds senior also carried out much work on his own, but the description "Wilds and Busby" was often used on designs, making individual attribution difficult. Wilds senior and his partners are remembered most for his work in post-Regency Brighton, where most of their houses, churches and hotels built in a bold Regency style remain—in particular, the distinctive and visionary Kemp Town and Brunswick estates on the edges of Brighton, whose constituent parts are Grade I listed buildings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Arundel_Terrace%2C_Kemp_Town_%28IoE_Code_479359%29.JPG/220px-Arundel_Terrace%2C_Kemp_Town_%28IoE_Code_479359%29.JPG
