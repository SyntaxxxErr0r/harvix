79.9	Triangulation	Triangulation	In trigonometry and geometry, triangulation is the process of determining the location of a point by measuring angles to it from known points at either end of a fixed baseline, rather than measuring distances to the point directly . The point can then be fixed as the third point of a triangle with one known side and two known angles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Theb1604_-_Flickr_-_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg/220px-Theb1604_-_Flickr_-_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg
