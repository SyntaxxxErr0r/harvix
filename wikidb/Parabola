72.6	Parabola	Parabola	In mathematics, a parabola (plural parabolae or parabolas, from the Greek παραβολή) is a conic section, created from the intersection of a right circular conical surface and a plane parallel to a generating straight line of that surface. Another way to generate a parabola is to examine a point (the focus) and a line (the directrix) on a plane. The locus of points in that plane that are equidistant from both the line and point is a parabola.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Parabola.svg/220px-Parabola.svg.png
