63.2	Anglo-Saxons	Anglo-Saxons	The term Anglo-Saxon is used by some historians to designate the Germanic tribes who invaded and settled the south and east of Britain beginning in the early 5th century and the period from their creation of the English nation to the Norman conquest. The Anglo-Saxon era denotes the period of English history between about 550 and 1066. The term is also used for the language, now known as Old English, that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons and their descendants in England (and part of southeastern Scotland) between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Sutton_hoo_helmet_room_1_no_flashbrightness_ajusted.JPG/242px-Sutton_hoo_helmet_room_1_no_flashbrightness_ajusted.JPG
