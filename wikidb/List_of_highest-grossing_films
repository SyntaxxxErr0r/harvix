89.8	List_of_highest-grossing_films	List of highest-grossing films	Films generate income from several revenue streams including public exhibition in theaters, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications (such as Variety and Box Office Mojo) in assessing the success of a film, mostly due to the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, and also due to historical practice. Included on the list are a chart of the top box-office earners, a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Poster_-_Gone_With_the_Wind_01.jpg/220px-Poster_-_Gone_With_the_Wind_01.jpg
