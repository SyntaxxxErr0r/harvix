2.21	Malcolm_J._Williamson	Malcolm J. Williamson	Malcolm John Williamson is a British mathematician and cryptographer. In 1974 he developed what is now known as Diffie-Hellman key exchange. He was then working at GCHQ and was therefore unable to publicize his research as his work was classified. Martin Hellman, who independently developed the key exchange at the same time, received credit for the discovery until Williamson's research was declassified by the British government in 1997.
