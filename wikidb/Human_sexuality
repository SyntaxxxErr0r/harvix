63.8	Human_sexuality	Human sexuality	Human sexuality is the capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. Human sexuality can also refer to the way someone is sexually attracted to another person, whether it is to the opposite sex , to the same sex (homosexuality), to either sex (bisexuality), to all gender identities (pansexuality), or not being attracted to anyone in a sexual manner (asexuality). Human sexuality impacts cultural, political, legal, and philosophical aspects of life. It can refer to issues of morality, ethics, theology, spirituality, or religion. It is not, however, directly tied to gender. Some cultures have been described as sexually repressive.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Sigmund_en_Anna.jpg/120px-Sigmund_en_Anna.jpg
