1.00	Roosevelt_Hotel,_New_Orleans	The Roosevelt New Orleans Hotel	The Roosevelt New Orleans Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana, was built by Louis Grunewald, a German immigrant, and opened in 1893 as "The Grunewald". In 1908, a major 400 room expansion was added which is shown as the main portion in the postcard. This expansion was designed by the Milwaukee architectural firm, H. C. Koch &amp; Sons. After various expansions it was purchased by a group of New Orleans investors and renamed "The Roosevelt Hotel" (in honor of late former president Theodore Roosevelt) in 1923.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/CanalBurgundyRoosevelt3Oct07.jpg/250px-CanalBurgundyRoosevelt3Oct07.jpg
