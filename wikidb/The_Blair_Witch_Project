60.1	The_Blair_Witch_Project	The Blair Witch Project	The Blair Witch Project is a 1999 American independent supernatural horror film, written and directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo SÃ¡nchez. The film was produced by the Haxan Films production company. It was pieced together from amateur footage and relates the story of three student filmmakers who disappeared while hiking in the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. The viewers are told the three were never seen or heard from again, although their video and sound equipment (along with most of the footage they shot) was discovered a year later. This "recovered footage" is presented as the film the viewer is watching.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/26/Blair_Witch_Project.jpg/220px-Blair_Witch_Project.jpg
