18.66	Freedom_Party_of_Austria	Freedom Party of Austria	The Freedom Party of Austrianote 1 (German: , FPÖ) is a political party in Austria. Ideologically, the party is a direct descendant of the German national liberal camp, which dates back to the 1848 revolutions. The FPÖ itself was founded in 1956 as the successor to the short-lived Federation of Independents (VdU), which had been founded seven years earlier. In the Austrian political landscape, the FPÖ was from its foundation a third party with only modest support until it entered into government together with the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) in the mid-1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Freedom_Party_of_Austria_logo.png/180px-Freedom_Party_of_Austria_logo.png
