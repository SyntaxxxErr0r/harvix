57.7	Dakar	Dakar	Dakar is the capital city and largest city of Senegal. It is located on the Cap-Vert Peninsula on the Atlantic coast and is the westernmost city on the African mainland. Its position, on the western edge of Africa, is an advantageous departure point for trans-Atlantic and European trade; this fact aided its growth into a major regional port.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Dakar_-_Panorama_urbain.jpg/250px-Dakar_-_Panorama_urbain.jpg
