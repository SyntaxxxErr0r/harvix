1.00	Micropterocerus	Ulidiidae	Ulidiidae (formerly Otitidae) is a large and diverse cosmopolitan family of flies, and, as in related families, most species are herbivorous or saprophagous. They are often known as picture-winged flies, along with members of other families in the superfamily Tephritoidea that have patterns of bands or spots on the wings. Most species share with the Tephritidae an unusual elongated projection of the anal cell in the wing, but can be differentiated by the smoothly-curving subcostal vein.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Tritoxa_incurva.JPG/220px-Tritoxa_incurva.JPG
