66.0	Memory_foam	Memory foam	Memory foam is polyurethane with additional chemicals increasing its viscosity and density. It is often referred to as "visco-elastic" polyurethane foam, or low-resilience polyurethane foam (see LRPu). Higher-density memory foam softens in reaction to body heat, allowing it to mold to a warm body in a few minutes. A lower-density memory foam is pressure-sensitive and molds quickly to the shape of a body pressing against it, returning to its original shape once the pressure is removed. The speed with which a foam returns to its original shape after a weight is removed is often part of the marketing message among memory-foam mattress producers, many of whom tout "newer generation" foams with "faster recovery."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/MemoryFoam-fast.jpg/220px-MemoryFoam-fast.jpg
