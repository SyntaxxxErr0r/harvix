The University was inspired by the vision of Israel's founder and first prime minister David Ben-Gurion, who believed that the future of the country lay in this region. After Ben-Gurion's death in 1973, the University was renamed Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b6/Bgu_logo.gif/100px-Bgu_logo.gif
