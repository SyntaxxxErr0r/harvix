The title was represented by two championship belts, which were worn by the champions. Originally, ECW was known as Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) when it was a subsidiary for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), a promotion that had numerous subsidiaries. In 1992, the NWA created the tag team championship for ECW and oversaw its operation; the NWA also owned the copyrights to the title. ECW withdrew as a subsidiary of the NWA in 1994 and gained ownership of the copyrights to its championships. The company also renamed itself to Extreme Championship Wrestling. The championship remained active until April 2001, when ECW filed for bankruptcy. All of ECW's assets were later purchased by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in mid-2003, including the copyrights to ECW's championships. In May 2006, WWE extended its promotion by adding ECW as a third additional brand, the others being Raw and SmackDown, in a storyline sports extension. The ECW World Heavyweight Championship was the only former ECW championship reactivated by WWE for the new brand. However, the ECW Tag Team Title history was published by WWE on its website.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Rob_Van_Dam_in_ECW.jpg/250px-Rob_Van_Dam_in_ECW.jpg
