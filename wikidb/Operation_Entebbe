A week earlier, on 27 June, an Air France plane with 248 passengers was hijacked, by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the German Revolutionary Cells, and flown to Entebbe, near Kampala, the capital of Uganda. Shortly after landing, all non-Israeli passengers, except one French citizen, were released.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Entebbe_Uganda_Airport_Old_Tower1.jpg/300px-Entebbe_Uganda_Airport_Old_Tower1.jpg
