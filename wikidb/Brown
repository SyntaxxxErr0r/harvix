62.9	Brown	Brown	Brown is a color term, denoting a range of composite colors produced by a mixture of orange, red, rose, or yellow with black or gray. The term is from Old English brún, in origin for any dusky or dark shade of color. The Common Germanic adjective *brûnoz, *brûnâ meant both dark colors and a glistening or shining quality, whence burnish. The current meaning developed in Middle English from the 14th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Color_icon_brown_v2.svg/250px-Color_icon_brown_v2.svg.png
