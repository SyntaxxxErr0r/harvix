6.21	Anax	Anax	(, from earlier ) is an ancient Greek word for "(tribal) king, lord, (military) leader". It is one of the two Greek titles traditionally translated as "king", the other being basileus. Anax is the more archaic term of the two, inherited from the Mycenaean period, and is notably used in Homeric Greek, e.g. of Agamemnon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Ceramic_fragment_with_WANAKTS_inscription.jpg/220px-Ceramic_fragment_with_WANAKTS_inscription.jpg
