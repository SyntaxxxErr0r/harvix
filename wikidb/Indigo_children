52.1	Indigo_children	Indigo children	Indigo children is a term used to describe children who are believed to possess special, unusual and sometimes supernatural traits or abilities. The term is pseudoscientific. The idea is based on New Age concepts developed in the 1970s by Nancy Ann Tappe. As defined by Jan Tober (one of the major proponents of the term and an author of several books on it) "...an Indigo child is one who displays a new and unusual set of psychological attributes, and shows a pattern of behavior generally undocumented before..." The concept of indigo children gained popular interest with the publication of a series of books in the late 1990s and the release of several films in the following decade. A variety of books, conferences and related materials have been created surrounding belief in the idea of indigo children and their nature and abilities. The interpretations of these beliefs range from their being the next stage in human evolution, in some cases possessing paranormal abilities such as telepathy, to the belief that they are simply more empathic and creative than their peers.
