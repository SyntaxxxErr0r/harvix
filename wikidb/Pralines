10.31	Pralines	Praline	Praline can refer to confections made from nuts and sugar syrup, whether in whole pieces or a ground powder, or to any chocolate confection containing the ground powder or nuts. Belgian pralines are different; they consist of a hard chocolate shell with a softer, sometimes liquid, filling. French pralines are a combination of almonds and caramelized sugar. American pralines from New Orleans also contain milk or cream and are therefore softer and creamier, resembling fudge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Krokant.jpg/200px-Krokant.jpg
