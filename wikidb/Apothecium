6.10	Apothecium	Ascocarp	An ascocarp, or ascoma (plural: ascomata), is the fruiting body of an ascomycete fungus. It consists of very tightly interwoven hyphae and may contain millions of asci, each of which typically contains eight ascospores. Ascocarps are most commonly bowl-shaped, but may take on a number of other forms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Ascocarp2.png/270px-Ascocarp2.png
