3.10	Falls_of_Cruachan_derailment	Falls of Cruachan derailment	The Falls of Cruachan derailment occurred on 6 June 2010 on the West Highland Line in Scotland, when a passenger train travelling between Glasgow and Oban hit boulders on the line and derailed near Falls of Cruachan railway station, after a landslide. The two-car diesel multiple unit caught fire and one carriage was left in a precarious position on the 50-foot (15 m) high embankment. Sixty passengers were evacuated, some with minor injures; eight of those were hospitalised as a precaution. In addition to blocking the line, the incident also caused the closure of the A85 road below the rail line. Both road and rail were closed for a week.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Corrour%282%29.jpg/250px-Corrour%282%29.jpg
