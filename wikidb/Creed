62.9	Creed	Creed	A creed is a statement of belief—usually a statement of faith that describes the beliefs shared by a religious community—and is often recited as part of a religious service. When the statement of faith is longer and polemical, as well as didactic, it is not called a creed but a Confession of faith. The term "creed" can also refer to a person's political or social beliefs or is sometimes used to mean religious affiliation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Nicaea_icon.jpg/220px-Nicaea_icon.jpg
