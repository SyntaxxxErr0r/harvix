4.01	Private_aviation	Private aviation	Private aviation is the part of civil aviation that does not include flying for hire. In most countries, private flights are always general aviation flights, but the opposite is not true: many general aviation flights (such as banner towing, charter, crop dusting, and others) are commercial in that the pilot is hired and paid. Many private pilots fly for their own enjoyment, or to share the joys and convenience of general aviation with friends and family.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/PrivatePilotC172family.jpg/300px-PrivatePilotC172family.jpg
