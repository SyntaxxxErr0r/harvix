1.00	Salomon_Gessner	Salomon Gessner	Solomon Gessner (1 April 1730 – 2 March 1788) was a Swiss painter and poet. His writing suited the taste of his time, though by some more recent standards it is “insipidly sweet and monotonously melodious.” As a painter, he represented the conventional classical landscape.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/SalomonGessner.jpg
