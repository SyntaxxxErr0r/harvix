Its name comes from the town Crolles where Petzl's company headquarters are located but might also be a reference to the nearby cave system of the Dent de Crolles, the exploration of which triggered a lot of technical effort leading to innovation in caving equipment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Petzl_croll.JPG/400px-Petzl_croll.JPG
