75.5	Pigovian_tax	Pigovian tax	A Pigovian tax (also spelled Pigouvian tax) is a tax levied on a market activity that generates negative externalities. The tax is intended to correct the market outcome. In the presence of negative externalities, the social cost of a market activity is not covered by the private cost of the activity. In such a case, the market outcome is not efficient and may lead to over-consumption of the product. A Pigovian tax equal to the negative externality is thought to correct the market outcome back to efficiency.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Social_cost_with_tax.svg/220px-Social_cost_with_tax.svg.png
