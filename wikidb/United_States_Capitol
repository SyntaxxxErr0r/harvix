90.3	United_States_Capitol	United States Capitol	The United States Capitol is the meeting place of the United States Congress, the legislature of the federal government of the United States. Located in Washington, D.C., it sits atop Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall. Though it has never been the geographic center of the federal district, the Capitol is the origin by which both the quadrants of the District are divided and the city was planned. Officially, both the east and west sides of the Capitol are referred to as "fronts." Historically, however, only the east front of the building was intended for the arrival of visitors and dignitaries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/United_States_Capitol_west_front_edit2.jpg/220px-United_States_Capitol_west_front_edit2.jpg
