78.7	Dog_breed	Dog breed	Dog breeds are groups of closely related and visibly similar domestic dogs, which are all of the subspecies Canis lupus familiaris, having characteristic traits that are selected and maintained by humans, bred from a known foundation stock. The term dog breed is also used to refer to natural breeds or landraces, which arose through time in response to a particular environment that included humans, with little or no selective breeding by humans. Such breeds are undocumented, and are identified by their appearance and often by a style of working. Ancient dog breeds are some of the modern (documented) descendants of such natural breeds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Big_and_little_dog_1.jpg/300px-Big_and_little_dog_1.jpg
