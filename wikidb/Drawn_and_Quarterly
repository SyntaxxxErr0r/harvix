4.10	Drawn_and_Quarterly	Drawn and Quarterly	Drawn and Quarterly is a Canadian comic book publishing company, headed by Chris Oliveros, and based in Montreal, Quebec. Its focus is on graphic novels and underground or alternative comics. Drawn and Quarterly was also the title of the company's flagship quarterly anthology during the 1990s. The name of the company is a pun on "drawing," "quarterly," and the practice of hanging, drawing and quartering. Oliveros helmed the company by himself for 13 years and then hired Peggy Burns as his associate publisher, formerly of DC Comics and Tom Devlin as his Creative Director, formerly of Highwater Books.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8b/DQlogo_sm.jpg
