51.6	Vowel	Vowel	In phonetics, a vowel is a sound in spoken language, such as English ah! or oh! , pronounced with an open vocal tract so that there is no build-up of air pressure at any point above the glottis. This contrasts with consonants, such as English sh! , where there is a constriction or closure at some point along the vocal tract. A vowel is also understood to be syllabic: an equivalent open but non-syllabic sound is called a semivowel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Blank_vowel_trapezoid.svg/300px-Blank_vowel_trapezoid.svg.png
