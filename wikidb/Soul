103.4	Soul	Soul	A soul – in certain spiritual, philosophical, and psychological traditions – is the incorporeal essence of a person, living thing, or object. Many philosophical and spiritual systems teach that only humans have souls, while others teach that all living things, and even inanimate objects (such as rivers), have souls. The latter belief is commonly called animism. Soul can function as a synonym for spirit, mind or self; scientific works, in particular, often consider 'soul' as a synonym for 'mind'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/SoulCarriedtoHeaven.jpg/250px-SoulCarriedtoHeaven.jpg
