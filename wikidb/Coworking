198.2	Coworking	Coworking	Coworking is a style of work which involves a shared working environment, sometimes an office, yet independent activity. Unlike in a typical office environment, those coworking are usually not employed by the same organization. Typically it is attractive to work-at-home professionals, independent contractors, or people who travel frequently who end up working in relative isolation. Coworking is the social gathering of a group of people, who are still working independently, but who share values, and who are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with talented people in the same space.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Citizen_Space%2C_San_Francisco%2C_CA.jpg/250px-Citizen_Space%2C_San_Francisco%2C_CA.jpg
