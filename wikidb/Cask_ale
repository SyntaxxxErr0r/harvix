59.9	Cask_ale	Cask ale	Cask ale or cask-conditioned beer is the term for unfiltered and unpasteurised beer which is conditioned (including secondary fermentation) and served from a cask without additional nitrogen or carbon dioxide pressure. Cask ale may also be referred to as real ale, a term coined by the Campaign for Real Ale, often now extended to cover bottle-conditioned beer as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Cask_Ales.jpg/250px-Cask_Ales.jpg
