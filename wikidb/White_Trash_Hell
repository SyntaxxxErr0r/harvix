1.10	White_Trash_Hell	White Trash Hell	White Trash Hell is an EP by Everclear, released on March 24, 1997. The disc is largely a collection of demos recorded with drummer Scott Cuthbert in 1994 in preparation for Sparkle and Fade. (The lone exception is the acoustic version of "Fire Maple Song", which features Greg Eklund on drums.) The band turned over the recordings to their UK label, Fire Records, expecting them to be released sometime in 1995. However, the label stalled on releasing the EP, and it remained unissued until 1997.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/White_Trash_Hell.jpg/220px-White_Trash_Hell.jpg
