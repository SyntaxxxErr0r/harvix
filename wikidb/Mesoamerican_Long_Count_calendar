For this reason, it is sometimes known as the Maya (or Mayan) Long Count calendar. Using a modified vigesimal tally, the Long Count calendar identifies a day by counting the number of days passed since a mythical creation date that corresponds to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar.n 1 The Long Count calendar was widely used on monuments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/La_Mojarra_Inscription_and_Long_Count_date.jpg/200px-La_Mojarra_Inscription_and_Long_Count_date.jpg
