2.00	Lambayeque_culture	Sican culture	The Sican (also Sic√°n) culture is the name that archaeologist Izumi Shimada gave to the culture that inhabited what is now the north coast of Peru between about AD 750 and 1375. According to Shimada, Sican means "temple of the moon". The Sican culture is also referred to as Lambayeque culture, after the name of the region in Peru. It succeeded the Moche culture. There is still controversy among archeologists and anthropologists over whether the two are separate cultures. The Sican culture is divided into three major periods based on cultural changes as evidenced in archeological artifacts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Peru_-_Regions_and_departments_%28labeled%29.svg/220px-Peru_-_Regions_and_departments_%28labeled%29.svg.png
