253.3	Native_Americans_in_the_United_States	Native Americans in the United States	Native Americans in the United States are the indigenous peoples in North America within the boundaries of the present-day continental United States, parts of Alaska, and the island state of Hawaii. They are composed of numerous, distinct Native American tribes and ethnic groups, many of which survive as intact political communities. The terms used to refer to Native Americans have been controversial. According to a 1995 US Census Bureau set of home interviews, most of the respondents with an expressed preference refer to themselves as American Indians or Indians, and this term has been adopted by major newspapers and some academic groups; however, this term does not include Native Hawaiians or those Alaskan Natives, such as Aleuts, Alutiiq, Cupik, Yupik, and Inuit peoples, who are not American Indians.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Poblamiento_de_America_-_Teor%C3%ADa_P_Tard%C3%ADo.png/300px-Poblamiento_de_America_-_Teor%C3%ADa_P_Tard%C3%ADo.png
