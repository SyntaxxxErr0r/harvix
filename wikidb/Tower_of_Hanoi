80.5	Tower_of_Hanoi	Tower of Hanoi	The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower, and sometimes pluralised) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Tower_of_Hanoi.jpeg/300px-Tower_of_Hanoi.jpeg
