55.1	Musical_film	Musical film	The musical film is a film genre in which songs sung by the characters are interwoven into the narrative, sometimes accompanied by dancing. The songs usually advance the plot or develop the film's characters, though in some cases they serve merely as breaks in the storyline, often as elaborate "production numbers". A subgenre of the musical film is the musical comedy, which also includes a strong element of humor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/TopHatORGI.jpg/250px-TopHatORGI.jpg
