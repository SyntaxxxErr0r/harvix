6.30	Rope_bridge	Rope bridge	A rope bridge is a bridge constructed chiefly of rope. In its simplest form, it can be one or two ropes that bridge a river, enabling the traveller to be supported in their crossing and not be swept away. One rope above another, for feet and hands, may be referred to as a commando bridge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/IRBSideViewClip.jpg/240px-IRBSideViewClip.jpg
