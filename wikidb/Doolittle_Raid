62.8	Doolittle_Raid	Doolittle Raid	The Doolittle Raid, on 18 April 1942, was the first air raid by the United States to strike the Japanese Home Islands (specifically Honshu) during World War II. By demonstrating that Japan itself was vulnerable to American air attack, it provided a vital morale boost and opportunity for U.S. retaliation after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. The raid was planned and led by then-Lieutenant Colonel James "Jimmy" Doolittle, USAAF. Doolittle would later recount in his autobiography that the raid was intended to bolster American morale and to cause the Japanese to begin doubting their leadership:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Army_B-25_%28Doolittle_Raid%29.jpg/300px-Army_B-25_%28Doolittle_Raid%29.jpg
