57.2	Paraben	Paraben	Parabens are a class of chemicals widely used as preservatives by cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Parabens are effective preservatives in many types of formulas. These compounds, and their salts, are used primarily for their bactericidal and fungicidal properties. They can be found in shampoos, commercial moisturizers, shaving gels, personal lubricants, topical/parenteral pharmaceuticals, spray tanning solution, makeup, and toothpaste. They are also used as food additives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Paraben-2D-skeletal.png/150px-Paraben-2D-skeletal.png
