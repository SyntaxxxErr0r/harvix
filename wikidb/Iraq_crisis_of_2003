2.00	Iraq_crisis_of_2003	Iraq disarmament crisis	The issue of Iraq's disarmament reached a crisis in 2002-2003, when U.S. President George W. Bush demanded a complete end to what he alleged was Iraqi production of weapons of mass destruction and that Iraq comply with UN Resolutions requiring UN weapons inspectors unfettered access to areas those inspectors thought might have weapons production facilities. Iraq had been banned by the United Nations from developing or possessing such weapons since the 1991 Gulf War. It was also required to permit inspections to confirm Iraqi compliance. Bush repeatedly backed demands for unfettered inspection and disarmament with threats of invasion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg/300px-Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg
