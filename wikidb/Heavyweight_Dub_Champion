6.31	Heavyweight_Dub_Champion	Heavyweight Dub Champion	Heavyweight Dub Champion is a music and art collective founded in Gold Hill, Colorado in 1997 by Resurrector &amp; Patch. Heavyweight Dub Champion, also known as HDC, is rooted in electronic music, but they create their unique style by using real and acoustic instruments fused with synthetic and electronic elements. In 2005, they relocated to San Francisco, but the members of their constantly rotating lineup also come from New York, Australia and the UK. Denver's Westword Magazine describes their music as "a shamanistic wall of hip hop dubtronica" and the magazine awarded their debut album Survival Guide For The End of Time with the editors pick for Best Local Recording in 2003. HDC is perhaps best known for their live performance, in which they use a massive amount of vintage and electronic gear to perform what they call "Sonic Shamanistic Alchemy". The LA Weekly says, "The main HDC aesthetic is a cooled-out groove... Their genius is the great virtue of â€™70s dub: never overdoing it."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/HDCLiveShot.jpg/220px-HDCLiveShot.jpg
