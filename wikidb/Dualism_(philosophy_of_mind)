74.6	Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)	Dualism (philosophy of mind)	In philosophy of mind, dualism is the assumption that mental phenomena are, in some respects non-physical, or that the mind and body are distinct. Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism, in the mindâ€“body problem.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Descartes_mind_and_body.gif/200px-Descartes_mind_and_body.gif
