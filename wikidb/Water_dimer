2.00	Water_dimer	Water dimer	The water dimer consists of two water molecules loosely bound by a hydrogen bond. It is the smallest water cluster. Because it is the simplest model system for studying hydrogen bonding in water, it has been the target of so many theoretical (and later experimental) studies that it has been called "a theoretical Guinea pig" (Jeffrey, 1997).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Water_dimer.jpg/220px-Water_dimer.jpg
