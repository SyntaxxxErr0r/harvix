1.10	Solar_eclipse_of_March_9,_2035	Solar eclipse of March 9, 2035	An annular solar eclipse will occur on March 9, 2035. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partially obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun, causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring), blocking most of the Sun's light. An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region thousands of kilometres wide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/SE2035Mar09A.png/320px-SE2035Mar09A.png
