This book is one of the earliest surviving mathematical texts from China, the first being Suàn shù shū (202 BCE – 186 BCE) and Zhou Bi Suan Jing (compiled throughout the Han until the late 2nd century CE). It lays out an approach to mathematics that centres on finding the most general methods of solving problems, which may be contrasted with the approach common to ancient Greek mathematicians, who tended to deduce propositions from an initial set of axioms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/%E4%B9%9D%E7%AB%A0%E7%AE%97%E8%A1%93.gif/240px-%E4%B9%9D%E7%AB%A0%E7%AE%97%E8%A1%93.gif
