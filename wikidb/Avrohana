1.10	Avrohana	Avarohana	An Avarohana, Avarohanam or Avarohan in Indian classical music terminology is the descending scale of any raga. Each raga has an avarohana and arohana. The notes descend in pitch from the octave tonic (Shadjam or Sa) down to the lower tonic. The Avarohana encompasses the notes included in descending passages but may also specify ornaments such as meend or gamak, convolutions in the scale (where it may not be a simple descending line) etc. Not every raga follows notes down in a strictly decreasing pitch.
