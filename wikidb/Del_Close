Considered one of the premier influences on modern improvisational theater, Close had a prolific career, appearing in a number of films and television shows. He was a co-author of the book Truth in Comedy, which outlines techniques now common to longform improvisational theater and describes the overall structure of “Harold” which remains a common frame for longer improvisational scenes. His favorite framework for comedic storytelling was the structures of Wagner’s Ring Cycle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Del_Close.jpg/220px-Del_Close.jpg
