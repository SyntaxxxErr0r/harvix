52.1	Philo_Farnsworth	Philo Farnsworth	Philo Taylor Farnsworth (August 19, 1906 â€“ March 11, 1971) was an American inventor and television pioneer. Although he made many contributions that were crucial to the early development of all-electronic television, he is perhaps best known for inventing the first fully functional all-electronic image pickup device , the "image dissector", the first fully functional and complete all-electronic television system, and for being the first person to demonstrate such a system to the public. Farnsworth developed a television system complete with receiver and camera, which he produced commercially in the form of the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation, from 1938 to 1951.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Philo_T_Farnsworth.jpg/200px-Philo_T_Farnsworth.jpg
