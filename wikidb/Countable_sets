3.00	Countable_sets	Countable set	In mathematics, a countable set is a set with the same cardinality (number of elements) as some subset of the set of natural numbers. A set that is not countable is called uncountable. The term was originated by Georg Cantor. The elements of a countable set can be counted one at a timeâ€”although the counting may never finish, every element of the set will eventually be associated with a natural number.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Pairing_natural.svg/300px-Pairing_natural.svg.png
