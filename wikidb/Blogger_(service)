94.7	Blogger_(service)	Blogger (service)	Blogger is a blog-publishing service that allows private or multi-user blogs with time-stamped entries. It was created by Pyra Labs, which was bought by Google in 2003. Generally, the blogs are hosted by Google at a subdomain of blogspot.com. Up until May 1, 2010 Blogger allowed users to publish blogs on other hosts, via FTP. All such blogs had (or still have) to be moved to Google's own servers, with domains other than blogspot.com allowed via Custom URLs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Blogger.svg/100px-Blogger.svg.png
