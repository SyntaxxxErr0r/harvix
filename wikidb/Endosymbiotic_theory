93.0	Endosymbiotic_theory	Endosymbiotic theory	The endosymbiotic theory concerns the mitochondria, plastids (e.g. chloroplasts), and possibly other organelles of eukaryotic cells. According to this theory, certain organelles originated as free-living bacteria that were taken inside another cell as endosymbionts. Mitochondria developed from proteobacteria (in particular, Rickettsiales, the SAR11 clade, or close relatives) and chloroplasts from cyanobacteria.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Mitochondrion_186.jpg
