58.0	Toxoplasma_gondii	Toxoplasma gondii	Toxoplasma gondii is a species of parasitic protozoa in the genus Toxoplasma. The definitive host of T. gondii is the cat, but the parasite can be carried by many warm-blooded animals (birds or mammals, including humans). Toxoplasmosis, the disease of which T. gondii is the causative agent, is usually minor and self-limiting but can have serious or even fatal effects on a fetus whose mother first contracts the disease during pregnancy or on an immunocompromised human or cat.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Toxoplasma_gondii_tachy.jpg
