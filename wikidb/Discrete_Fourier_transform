52.1	Discrete_Fourier_transform	Discrete Fourier transform	In mathematics, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is a specific kind of discrete transform, used in Fourier analysis. It transforms one function into another, which is called the frequency domain representation, or simply the DFT, of the original function (which is often a function in the time domain). The DFT requires an input function that is discrete. Such inputs are often created by sampling a continuous function, such as a person's voice. The discrete input function must also have a limited duration, such as one period of a periodic sequence or a windowed segment of a longer sequence. Unlike the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), the DFT only evaluates enough frequency components to reconstruct the finite segment that was analyzed. The inverse DFT cannot reproduce the entire time domain, unless the input happens to be periodic. Therefore it is often said that the DFT is a transform for Fourier analysis of finite-domain discrete-time functions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/From_Continuous_To_Discrete_Fourier_Transform.gif/400px-From_Continuous_To_Discrete_Fourier_Transform.gif
