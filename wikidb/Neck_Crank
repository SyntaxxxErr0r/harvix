2.21	Neck_Crank	Spinal lock	A spinal lock is a multiple joint lock applied to the spinal column, which is performed by forcing the spine beyond its normal ranges of motion. This is typically done by bending or twisting the head or upper body into abnormal positions. Commonly, spinal locks might strain the spinal musculature or result in a mild spinal sprain, while a forcefully and/or suddenly applied spinal lock may cause severe ligament damage or damage to the vertebrae, and possibly result in serious spinal cord injury, strokes, or death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Youth_spinal_lock.jpg/220px-Youth_spinal_lock.jpg
