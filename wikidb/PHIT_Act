1.00	PHIT_Act	PHIT Act	Introduced April 27, 2009 by Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI), The Personal Health Investment Today Act (H.R. 2105), commonly known as PHIT, is legislation pending in Congress to allow for reimbursement of physical activity expenses using pre-tax dollars. PHIT would expand the definition of a medical expense to include qualified physical activities as a form of prevention. Contributions to existing pre-tax medical accounts, flexible spending accounts, re-imbursement accounts could be used to pay for physical activity expenses. The contributions are limited to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for families annually and would not increase existing caps on contributions to pre-tax accounts.
