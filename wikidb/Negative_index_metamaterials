7.10	Negative_index_metamaterials	Negative index metamaterials	Negative index metamaterials or negative index materials are artificial structures where the refractive index has a negative value over some frequency range. This does not occur in any known natural materials, and thus is only achievable with engineered structures known as metamaterials. Metamaterial refers broadly to any synthetic material with unusual refractive properties, among other descriptions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Artist%27s_rendition_of_the_new_light-bending_metamaterial.jpg/170px-Artist%27s_rendition_of_the_new_light-bending_metamaterial.jpg
