205.8	Ayurveda	Ayurveda	Ayurveda or ayurvedic medicine is a system of traditional medicine native to India and a form of alternative medicine. The earliest literature on Indian medical practice appeared during the Vedic period in India, i.e., in the mid-second millennium BCE. The Suśruta Saṃhitā and the Charaka Saṃhitā, encyclopedias of medicine compiled from various sources from the mid-first millennium BCE to about 500 CE, are among the foundational works of Ayurveda. Over the following centuries, ayurvedic practitioners developed a number of medicinal preparations and surgical procedures for the treatment of various ailments. Current practices derived (or reportedly derived) from Ayurvedic medicine are regarded as part of complementary and alternative medicine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Dhanvantari-at-Ayurveda-expo.jpg/200px-Dhanvantari-at-Ayurveda-expo.jpg
