85.6	Aeneid	Aeneid	The Aeneid (Latin: â€”the title is Greek in form: genitive case Aeneidos) is a Latin epic poem, written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC, that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who travelled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. It is composed of roughly 10,000 lines in dactylic hexameter. The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Aeneas%27_Flight_from_Troy_by_Federico_Barocci.jpg/300px-Aeneas%27_Flight_from_Troy_by_Federico_Barocci.jpg
