1.00	Parivara	Parivara	Parivara (Pali for "accessory") is the third and last book of the Theravadin Vinaya Pitaka. It includes a summary and multiple analyses of the various rules identified in the Vinaya Pitaka's first two books, the Suttavibhanga and the Khandhaka, primarily for didactic purposes. As it includes a long list of teachers in Ceylon, even Theravada fundamentalists recognize that, at least in its present form, it is of late date. Scholars give it a late date, some suggesting it may be even later than the Fourth Council in Ceylon in the last century BCE, at which the Pali Canon was written down from oral tradition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Asokanpillar-crop.jpg/130px-Asokanpillar-crop.jpg
