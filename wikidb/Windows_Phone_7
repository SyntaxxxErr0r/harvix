139.5	Windows_Phone_7	Windows Phone	Windows Phone is a mobile operating system developed by Microsoft, and is the successor to its Windows Mobile platform, although incompatible with it. Unlike its predecessor, it is primarily aimed at the consumer market rather than the enterprise market. It was launched in Europe, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada, Mexico, and the EPAL region in the second half of 2010, and Asia in early 2011. With Windows Phone, Microsoft offers a new user interface with its design language, Metro, integrates the operating system with third party and other Microsoft services, and set minimum requirements to the hardware on which it runs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/WindowsPhone7logo.svg/220px-WindowsPhone7logo.svg.png
