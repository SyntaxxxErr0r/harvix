The award is presented to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport in that year. The award is decided by a panel of over 30 sporting journalists. Each panelist votes for their top two choices; their first preference is awarded two points, and their second preference is awarded one point. The winning sportsperson has the most total points. In the case of a points tie, the sportsperson chosen as first preference by the most panelists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Novak_Djokovic_Hopman_Cup_2011_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-Novak_Djokovic_Hopman_Cup_2011_%28cropped%29.jpg
