126.5	Mosquito	Mosquito	The mosquitoes are a family of small, midge-like flies: the Culicidae. Although a few species are harmless or even useful to humanity, most are a nuisance because they suck blood from vertebrates, many of them attacking humans. In feeding on blood various species of mosquitoes transmit some of the most harmful human and livestock diseases. Some authorities argue accordingly that mosquitoes are the most dangerous animals on earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Mosquito_2007-2.jpg/220px-Mosquito_2007-2.jpg
