The books chronicle the adventures of teenager Meggie Folchart whose life changes dramatically when she realizes that she and her father, a bookbinder named Mo, have the unusual ability to bring characters from books into the real world when reading aloud. Mostly set in Northern Italy and the parallel world of the fictional Inkheart book, the central story arc concerns the magic of books, their characters and creatures, and the art of reading.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/Inkheart_original_book_covers.jpg/300px-Inkheart_original_book_covers.jpg
