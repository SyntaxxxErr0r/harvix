53.7	United_States_copyright_law	Copyright law of the United States	The U.S. Congress first exercised its power to enact copyright legislation with the Copyright Act of 1790. The Act secured an author the exclusive right to publish and vend "maps, charts and books" for a term of 14 years, with the right of renewal for one additional 14 year term if the author was still alive. The act did not regulate other kinds of writings, such as musical compositions or newspapers and specifically noted that it did not prohibit copying the works of foreign authors. The vast majority of writings were never registered â€” between 1790 and 1799, of approximately 13,000 titles published in the United States, only 556 works were registered.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Copyright_Act_of_1790_in_Colombian_Centinel.jpg/250px-Copyright_Act_of_1790_in_Colombian_Centinel.jpg
