51.2	Ivy_Mike	Ivy Mike	Ivy Mike was the codename given to the first United States test of a thermonuclear device in which a major part of the explosive yield came from nuclear fusion. It was detonated on November 1, 1952 by the United States on Enewetak, an atoll in the Pacific Ocean, as part of Operation Ivy. The device was the first full test of the Teller-Ulam design, a staged fusion bomb, and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/IvyMike2.jpg/250px-IvyMike2.jpg
