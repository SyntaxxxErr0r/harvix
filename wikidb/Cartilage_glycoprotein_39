1.00	Cartilage_glycoprotein_39	Cartilage glycoprotein 39	Chondrex, or chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), Cartilage glycoprotein-39 (gp-39)or Chondrocyte protein YKL-40 is one of the major secreted proteins of ex vivo cultured human articular chondrocytes, synovial cells, and macrophages and also expressed by mature neutrophils (from myelocyte-metamyelocyte stage). High levels of YKL-40 are found in synovial fluid from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in the hippocampus of schizophrenic patients. YKL-40 belongs to the 18-glycosyl hydrolase (mammalian chitinase) family, and is one of the putative autoantigens in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). High levels of YKL-40 are found in synovial fluid from patients with active RA. The name 'YKL' stands for its N-terminal tripeptide sequence, and unlike the other member YKL39 (CHITINASE 3-LIKE 2 or CHI3L2; CHONDROCYTE PROTEIN 39) which is unglycosylated, YKL40 is glycosylated. Unlike YKL-40, YKL39 is upregulated in Osteoarthritis but not in rheumatoid arthritis.
