1.00	Cow-Parsnip	Cow Parsnip	The Cow Parsnip is the only member of the genus Heracleum native to North America. Its classification has caused some difficulty, with recent authoritative sources referring to it variously as Heracleum maximum or Heracleum lanatum , as H. linatum, or as either a subspecies, H. sphondylium subsp. montanum, or a variety, H. sphondylium var. linatum, of the Common Hogweed (H. sphondylium). The classification given here follows ITIS.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Heracleum_lanatum_07269.JPG/220px-Heracleum_lanatum_07269.JPG
