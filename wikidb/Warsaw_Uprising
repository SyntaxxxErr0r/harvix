65.9	Warsaw_Uprising	Warsaw Uprising	The Warsaw Uprising (Polish: ) was a major World War II operation by the Polish resistance Home Army (Polish: ), to liberate Warsaw from Nazi Germany. The rebellion was timed to coincide with the Soviet Union's Red Army approaching the eastern suburbs of the city and the retreat of German forces. Controversially, the Soviet advance stopped short, enabling the Germans to regroup and take the city back from the Polish resistance, which fought for 63 days with little outside support.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Warszawa_Powstanie_1944-08-04.jpg/200px-Warszawa_Powstanie_1944-08-04.jpg
