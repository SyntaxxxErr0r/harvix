69.3	Medical_prescription	Medical prescription	A prescription () is a health-care program implemented by a physician or other medical doctors in the form of instructions that govern the plan of care for an individual patient. Prescriptions may include orders to be performed by a patient, caretaker, nurse, pharmacist or other therapist. Commonly, the term prescription is used to mean an order to take certain medications. Prescriptions have legal implications, as they may indicate that the prescriber takes responsibility for the clinical care of the patient and in particular for monitoring efficacy and safety. As medications have increasingly become preâ€“packaged manufactured products and medical practice has become more complex, the scope of meaning of the term "prescription" has broadened to also include clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and imaging studies relevant to optimizing the safety or efficacy of medical treatment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Rx_symbol_border.svg/160px-Rx_symbol_border.svg.png
