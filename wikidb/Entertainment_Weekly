Unlike celebrity-focused publications Us Weekly, People Weekly, and In Touch Weekly, EW's primary concentration is on entertainment media news and critical reviews. Unlike Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, which are aimed at industry insiders, EW targets a more general audience.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Firstew.jpg/220px-Firstew.jpg
