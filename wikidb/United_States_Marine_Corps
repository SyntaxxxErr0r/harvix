191.0	United_States_Marine_Corps	United States Marine Corps	The United States Marine Corps is a branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for providing power projection from the sea, using the mobility of the United States Navy to deliver combined-arms task forces rapidly. It is one of seven uniformed services of the United States. In the civilian leadership structure of the United States military, the Marine Corps is a component of the United States Department of the Navy, often working closely with U.S. naval forces for training, transportation, and logistic purposes; however, in the military leadership structure the Marine Corps is a separate branch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/USMC_logo.svg/210px-USMC_logo.svg.png
