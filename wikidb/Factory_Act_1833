1.00	Factory_Act_1833	Factory Acts	After the Whigs gained power in Parliament, the Ten Hour Bill (also known as the Ten Hour Act) was passed becoming the Factories Act 1847 (citation 10 &amp; 11 Vict c. 29). This law limited the work week in textile mills (and other textile industries except lace and silk production) for women and children under 18 years of age. Each work week contained 63 hours effective 1 July 1847 and was reduced to 58 hours effective 1 May 1848. In effect, this law limited the workday to 10 hours.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Variant_1%29.svg/150px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Variant_1%29.svg.png
