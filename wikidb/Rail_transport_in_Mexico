4.10	Rail_transport_in_Mexico	Rail transport in Mexico	Mexico has a freight railway system that is privately owned and extends across most of the country, connecting major industrial centers with ports and with rail connections at the United States border. Mexico's passenger rail service consisted of a limited number of tourist trains between 1997, when Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México suspended service, and 2008, when Ferrocarril Suburbano de la Zona Metropolitana de México inaugurated Mexico's first commuter rail service between Mexico City and the State of Mexico.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Ferromex-map.png/300px-Ferromex-map.png
