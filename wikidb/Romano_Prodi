Following the victory of his coalition The Union over the House of Freedoms led by Silvio Berlusconi in the April 2006 Italian elections Prodi was in power again. On 24 January 2008, he lost a vote of confidence in the Senate house, and consequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, but continued in office for almost four months for routine business, until early elections were held and a new government was formed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Romano_Prodi_in_Nova_Gorica_%282c%29.jpg/220px-Romano_Prodi_in_Nova_Gorica_%282c%29.jpg
