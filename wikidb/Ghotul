3.00	Ghotul	Ghotul	A Ghotul is a spacious tribal hut surrounded by earthen or wooden walls. It is an integral part of Gond tribal life in Bastar region of Chhattisgarh and the neighboring areas in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh in India. It’s a place by youths and for youths, an independent and autonomous children’s republic as mentioned in Verrier Elwin’s memoirs. Tribal world elsewhere too has developed such social institutions like village guardrooms by the Nagas, a boys' club among the Uraons which exists in northern part of Chhattisgarh too or a refuge for temporary sexual association in Indonesia, but what distinguishes Ghotul is its centrality in social and religious life of the Gonds. According to Gond legend, Lingo, the supreme deity, founded the Ghotul.
