7.30	Deadnettle	Lamium	Lamium is a genus of about 40-50 species of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, of which family it is the type genus. They are all herbaceous plants native to Europe, Asia, and north Africa, but several have become very successful weeds of crop fields and are now widely naturalised across the temperate world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lamium_8229.jpg/220px-Lamium_8229.jpg
