124.5	Supermarket	Supermarket	A supermarket, a form of grocery store, is a self-service store offering a wide variety of food and household merchandise, organized into departments. It is larger in size and has a wider selection than a traditional grocery store, also selling items typically found in a convenience store, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box store.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Supermarkt.jpg/250px-Supermarkt.jpg
