87.3	Message_Passing_Interface	Message Passing Interface	Message Passing Interface is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed by a group of researchers from academia and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computers. The standard defines the syntax and semantics of a core of library routines useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs in Fortran 77 or the C programming language. Several well-tested and efficient implementations of MPI include some that are free and in the public domain. These fostered the development of a parallel software industry, and there encouraged development of portable and scalable large-scale parallel applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/AmdahlsLaw.svg/200px-AmdahlsLaw.svg.png
