Gloria reached Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas, but weakened significantly by the time it made landfall on North Carolina's Outer Banks. Gloria closely followed the Mid-Atlantic coastline and made a second landfall on Long Island, and, after crossing the Long Island Sound, it made a third landfall in Connecticut.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Gloria_24_sep_1985_1813Z_N9.jpg/220px-Gloria_24_sep_1985_1813Z_N9.jpg
