1.01	Anti-submarine_mortar	Anti-submarine mortar	Anti-submarine mortars are artillery pieces deployed on ships for the purpose of sinking submarines by a direct hit with a small explosive charge. They are often larger versions of the mortar used by infantry and fire a projectile in relatively the same manner. They were created during World War II as a development of the depth charge and work on the same principle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/SS_Orca_7.5_inch_naval_howitzer_AWM_J02912.jpeg/220px-SS_Orca_7.5_inch_naval_howitzer_AWM_J02912.jpeg
