66.4	Merce_Cunningham	Merce Cunningham	Mercier "Merce" Philip Cunningham (April 16, 1919 â€“ July 26, 2009) was an American dancer and choreographer who was at the forefront of the American avant-garde for more than 50 years. Throughout much of his life, Cunningham was considered one of the greatest creative forces in American dance. He is also notable for his frequent collaborations with artists of other disciplines, including musicians John Cage and David Tudor, artists Robert Rauschenberg and Bruce Nauman, designer Romeo Gigli, and architect Benedetta Tagliabue. Works that he produced with these artists had a profound impact on avant-garde art beyond the world of dance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6d/Merce_Cunningham_by_Annie_Leibovitz.jpg/220px-Merce_Cunningham_by_Annie_Leibovitz.jpg
