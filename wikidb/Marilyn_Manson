71.6	Marilyn_Manson	Marilyn Manson	Marilyn Manson (born Brian Hugh Warner; January 5, 1969) is an American musician, artist and former music journalist known for his controversial stage persona and image as the lead singer of the eponymous band Marilyn Manson. Marilyn Manson is of Polish-German origin. His stage name was formed from juxtaposing the names of two 1960s American cultural icons, namely actress Marilyn Monroe and convicted multiple murder mastermind Charles Manson as a critical and, simultaneously, laudatory appraisal of America and its peculiar culture. He has a long legacy of being depicted in the media as a detrimental influence on young people. The seemingly outrageous styles for which he models and the controversy surrounding his lyrics have led to his public appeal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Marilyn_Manson.jpg/250px-Marilyn_Manson.jpg
