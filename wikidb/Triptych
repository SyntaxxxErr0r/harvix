54.8	Triptych	Triptych	A triptych ( -tik; (from the Greek adjective τρίπτυχοs ("three-fold"), from tri-= "three" + ptysso= "to fold") is a work of art (usually a panel painting) which is divided into three sections, or three carved panels which are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of polyptych, the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Verdun_Altar.JPG/220px-Verdun_Altar.JPG
