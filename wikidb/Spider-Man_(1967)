1.00	Spider-Man_(1967)	Spider-Man (TV series)	The first animated series was simply titled Spider-Man, and ran on ABC from 1967 to 1970. The show's first season was produced by Grantray-Lawrence Animation, which soon went bankrupt. In 1968, animator Ralph Bakshi took over. Bakshi's episodes, which suffered from extremely low budgets, were stylized and featured dark ominous settings and pervasive background music. One episode reused complete background animation, characters, and storyline from an episode of Rocket Robin Hood. The series may be best remembered for its theme song. Spider-Man was voiced by Paul Soles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Toei_Spiderman_TC.PNG/200px-Toei_Spiderman_TC.PNG
