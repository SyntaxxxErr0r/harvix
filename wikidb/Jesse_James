94.1	Jesse_James	Jesse James	Jesse Woodson James (September 5, 1847 â€“ April 3, 1882) was an American outlaw, gang leader, bank robber, train robber, and murderer from the state of Missouri and the most famous member of the James-Younger Gang. Already a celebrity when he was alive, he became a legendary figure of the Wild West after his death. Some recent scholars place him in the context of regional insurgencies of ex-Confederates following the American Civil War rather than a manifestation of frontier lawlessness or alleged economic justice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Jesse_james_portrait.jpg/220px-Jesse_james_portrait.jpg
