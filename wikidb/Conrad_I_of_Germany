2.20	Conrad_I_of_Germany	Conrad I of Germany	Conrad I (German: ; c. 890 â€“ 23 December 918), called the Younger, was Duke of Franconia from 906 and King of Germany from 911 to 918, the only king of the Conradine (or Franconian) dynasty. Though Conrad never used the title rex Teutonicorum ("king of the Germans") nor rex Romanorum ("King of the Romans"), he was the first king of East Francia who was elected by the rulers of the German stem duchies as successor of the last Carolingian ruler Louis the Child. His Kingdom of Germany evolved into the Holy Roman Empire upon the coronation of Emperor Otto I in 962.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Carolingian_empire_915.svg/220px-Carolingian_empire_915.svg.png
