137.9	Radar	Radar	Radar is an object-detection system which uses radio waves to determine the range, altitude, direction, or speed of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. The radar dish or antenna transmits pulses of radio waves or microwaves which bounce off any object in their path. The object returns a tiny part of the wave's energy to a dish or antenna which is usually located at the same site as the transmitter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Radar_antenna.jpg/220px-Radar_antenna.jpg
