45.43	Differential_geometry	Differential geometry	Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the techniques of differential calculus and integral calculus, as well as linear algebra and multilinear algebra, to study problems in geometry. The theory of plane and space curves and of surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space formed the basis for development of differential geometry during the 18th century and the 19th century. Since the late 19th century, differential geometry has grown into a field concerned more generally with the geometric structures on differentiable manifolds. Differential geometry is closely related to differential topology, and to the geometric aspects of the theory of differential equations. Grigori Perelman's proof of the Poincar√© conjecture using the techniques of Ricci flows demonstrated the power of the differential-geometric approach to questions in topology and it highlighted the important role played by its analytic methods. The differential geometry of surfaces captures many of the key ideas and techniques characteristic of this field.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Hyperbolic_triangle.svg/250px-Hyperbolic_triangle.svg.png
