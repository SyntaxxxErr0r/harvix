51.6	Sewage	Sewage	Sewage is water-carried waste, in solution or suspension, that is intended to be removed from a community. Also known as wastewater, it is more than 99% water and is characterized by volume or rate of flow, physical condition, chemical constituents and the bacteriological organisms that it contains. In loose American English usage, the terms 'sewage' and 'sewerage' are sometimes interchanged. Both words are descended from Old French assewer, derived from the Latin exaquare, "to drain out (water)"	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Nygrand_2_mars_2007.JPG/220px-Nygrand_2_mars_2007.JPG
