1.00	Tigrinya_people	Tigray-Tigrinya people	Tigray-Tigrinya are an ethnic group who live in the southern, central and northern parts of Eritrea and the northern highlands of Ethiopia's Tigray province. They also live in Ethiopia's former provinces of Begemder (Gonder) and Wollo, which are today mostly part of Amhara Region, though a few regions (e.g. Wolqayt, Tselemti, Raya, Humera) were incorporated instead into modern Tigray Region. Their language is called Tigrinya. They make up approximately 96.6% of the inhabitants of the Tigray Region, and are 6.1% of the population of Ethiopia as a whole, numbering little more than 5.7 million. Tigrinya speakers are 55% of the population in neighboring Eritrea at about 3.4 million people.
