105.8	Women's_suffrage	Women's suffrage	Women's suffrage or woman suffrage is the right of women to vote and to run for office. The expression is also used for the economic and political reform movement aimed at extending these rights to women and without any restrictions or qualifications such as property ownership, payment of tax, or marital status. The movement's modern origins can be attributed to late-18th century France.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Rose-Sanderson-Votes-for-Women.jpeg/300px-Rose-Sanderson-Votes-for-Women.jpeg
