60.0	Bank_of_England	Bank of England	The Bank of England (formally the Governor and Company of the Bank of England) is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in the world (the oldest being the Sveriges Riksbank , established in 1668). It was established to act as the English Government's banker, and to this day it still acts as the banker for HM Government. The Bank was privately owned and operated from its foundation in 1694. It was subordinated to the Treasury after 1931 in making policy and was nationalised in 1946.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Bank_of_England.svg/126px-Bank_of_England.svg.png
