1.00	Occoms_razor	Occam's razor	Occam's razor (also written as Ockham's razor) is the English equivalent of the Latin lex parsimoniae --- the law of parsimony, economy or succinctness. It is a principle urging one to select among competing hypotheses that which makes the fewest assumptions and thereby offers the simplest explanation of the effect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Sunlight_over_Earth_as_seen_by_STS-29_crew_-_GPN-2003-00025.jpg/220px-Sunlight_over_Earth_as_seen_by_STS-29_crew_-_GPN-2003-00025.jpg
