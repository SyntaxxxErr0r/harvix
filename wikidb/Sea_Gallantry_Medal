1.20	Sea_Gallantry_Medal	Sea Gallantry Medal	The Sea Gallantry Medal (SGM) (officially 'The Board of Trade Medal for Saving Life at Sea'), is an award for civil gallantry at sea in Great Britain and the Commonwealth. The Merchant Shipping Act 1854 permitted the issue of this award and SGMs were first struck in 1855. They were first awarded either for 'humanity' (where there was little risk to the life of the recipient), or for gallantry (where there was significant risk to the recipient).
