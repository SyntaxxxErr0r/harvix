4.12	Funana	Funaná	The Funaná is a music and dance genre from Cape Verde. Funaná is an accordion-based music. It is perhaps the most upbeat form of Cape Verdean music. The rhythm is usually provided by the ferrinho much like the use of washboards in zydeco, the saw in Caribbean ripsaw music, the scraper in Sub-Saharan African music and the güiro in Latin and Pre-Columbian music.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Bino_Branco.jpg/300px-Bino_Branco.jpg
