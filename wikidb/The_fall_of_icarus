1.00	The_fall_of_icarus	Landscape with the Fall of Icarus	Landscape with the Fall of Icarus is a painting in oil on canvas (73.5 by 112 centimetres (28.9 Ã— 44 in)) long thought to be by Pieter Bruegel, although following technical examinations in 1996, that attribution is regarded as very doubtful, and it is now seen as a good early copy by an unknown artist of Bruegel's original, perhaps painted in the 1560s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Bruegel%2C_Pieter_de_Oude_-_De_val_van_icarus_-_hi_res.jpg/370px-Bruegel%2C_Pieter_de_Oude_-_De_val_van_icarus_-_hi_res.jpg
