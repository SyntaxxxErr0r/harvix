1.42	Brother_of_Jared	Brother of Jared	According to the Book of Mormon, the brother of Jared is the most prominent person in the account given in the beginning (Chapters 1 - 6) of the Book of Ether. Moriancumer is the name of the place where Jared and the people he was traveling with (later to be called Jaredites) settled for a time. Some years after the publication of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith, Jr. mentioned that Mahonri Moriancumer was the name of the "brother of Jared."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Mormon-book.jpg/120px-Mormon-book.jpg
