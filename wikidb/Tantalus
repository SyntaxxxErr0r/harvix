36.42	Tantalus	Tantalus	Tantalus was a Greek mythological figure, most famous for his eternal punishment in Tartarus: to stand in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree with low branches, with the fruit always eluding his grasp, and the water always receding before he could take a drink. He was the father of Pelops, Niobe and Broteas, and was a son of Zeus and the nymph Plouto. Thus, like other heroes in Greek mythology such as Theseus and the Dioskouroi, Tantalus had both a hidden, divine sire and a mortal one.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Mount_Yamanlar_Karagol_IzmirTurkey.jpg/200px-Mount_Yamanlar_Karagol_IzmirTurkey.jpg
