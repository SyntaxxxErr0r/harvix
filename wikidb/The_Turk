162.5	The_Turk	The Turk	The Turk, also known as the Mechanical Turk or Automaton Chess Player (German: , "chess Turk"' Hungarian: ), was a fake chess-playing machine constructed in the late 18th century. From 1770 until its destruction by fire in 1854, it was exhibited by various owners as an automaton, though it was exposed in the early 1820s as an elaborate hoax. Constructed and unveiled in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen (1734â€“1804) to impress the Empress Maria Theresa, the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, as well as perform the knight's tour, a puzzle that requires the player to move a knight to occupy every square of a chessboard exactly once.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Turk-engraving5.jpg/250px-Turk-engraving5.jpg
