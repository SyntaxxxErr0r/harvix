1.10	Read_'Em_and_Weep	Read 'Em and Weep	"Read 'Em and Weep" is a rock music song composed by Jim Steinman. Originally written for Meat Loaf and recorded for his 1981 album, Dead Ringer, the second of only two tracks on the album produced by Steinman and Jimmy Iovine, it did not become a hit until late-1983, when a slightly rewritten version was recorded by Barry Manilow as one of three new tracks on his compilation album, Greatest Hits, Vol. II. The Manilow version reached number eighteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Adult Contemporary chart.
