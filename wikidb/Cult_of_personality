66.8	Cult_of_personality	Cult of personality	A cult of personality arises when an individual uses mass media, propaganda, or other methods, to create an idealized and heroic public image, often through unquestioning flattery and praise. Cults of personality are usually associated with dictatorships. Sociologist Max Weber developed a tripartite classification of authority; the cult of personality holds parallels with what Weber defined as "charismatic authority". A cult of personality is similar to hero worship, except that it is established by mass media and propaganda.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/1950s_%E6%AF%9B%E4%B8%BB%E5%B8%AD%E7%BB%99%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E7%9A%84%E5%B9%B8%E7%A6%8F%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB.jpg/220px-1950s_%E6%AF%9B%E4%B8%BB%E5%B8%AD%E7%BB%99%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E7%9A%84%E5%B9%B8%E7%A6%8F%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB.jpg
