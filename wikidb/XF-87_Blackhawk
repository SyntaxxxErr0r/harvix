2.31	XF-87_Blackhawk	Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk	The Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk (previously designated the XP-87) was a prototype American all-weather jet fighter interceptor and the company's last aircraft project. Designed as a replacement for the World War II-era propeller-driven P-61 Black Widow night/interceptor aircraft, the XF-87 lost in government procurement competition to the Northrop F-89 Scorpion. The loss of the contract was fatal to the company; the Curtiss-Wright Corporation closed down its aviation division, selling its assets to North American Aviation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Curtiss_XF-87_Blackhawk.jpg/300px-Curtiss_XF-87_Blackhawk.jpg
