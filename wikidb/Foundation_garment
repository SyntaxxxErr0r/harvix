8.72	Foundation_garment	Foundation garment	A foundation garment (also known as shapewear or shaping underwear) is an undergarment designed to temporarily alter the wearer's body shape, to achieve a more fashionable figure. The function of a foundation garment is not to enhance a bodily feature (as would, for example, a padded bra) but to smooth or control the display of one.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Cluttered_lingerie_drawer.jpg/225px-Cluttered_lingerie_drawer.jpg
