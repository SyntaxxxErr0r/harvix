74.5	Logo_programming_language	Logo (programming language)	Logo is a multi-paradigm computer programming language used in education. It is an adaptation and dialect of the Lisp language; some have called it Lisp without the parentheses. It was originally conceived and written as a functional programming language, and drove a mechanical turtle as an output device. It also has significant facilities for handling lists, files, I/O, and recursion. Today it is remembered mainly for its turtle graphics, though for tertiary level teaching it has been superseded by Scheme, and scripting languages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Remi_turtlegrafik.png/300px-Remi_turtlegrafik.png
