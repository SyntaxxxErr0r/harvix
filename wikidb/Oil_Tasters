3.20	Oil_Tasters	Oil Tasters	Oil Tasters were an early 1980s band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States. They are one of the city's best remembered post-punk groups. They were not, however, easy to fit into the spectrum of post-punk music. Rather than use No Wave, for example, as a foundation, the Oil Tasters start with surrealist literature, then musically move through jazz and rock, with occasional references to James Brown.
