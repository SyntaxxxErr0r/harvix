1.21	Rudaj_Organization	Rudaj Organization	The Rudaj Organization was the name given the Albanian mafia in the New York City metro area, so named for the man accused of being its kingpin, Alex Rudaj of Yorktown, New York. The Rudaj Organization, called "The Corporation" by its members, was started in 1993 in Westchester and spread to the Bronx and Queens. Prosecutors say the Albanian gang was headed by Alex Rudaj and an Italian named Nardino Colotti who had ties to the late Gambino soldier Skinny Phil Loscalzo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Alex_Rudaj_on_15_April_2003.jpg
