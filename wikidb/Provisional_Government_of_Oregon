8.30	Provisional_Government_of_Oregon	Provisional Government of Oregon	The Provisional Government of Oregon was a popularly elected government created in the Oregon Country, in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. It existed from May 2, 1843 until March 3, 1849. Created at a time when no country had sovereignty over the region, this independent government provided a legal system and a common defense for pioneers settling the region. As laid out in Section 1 of the preamble to the Organic Laws of Oregon, which were adopted in 1843 to serve as a constitution, settlers only agreed to the laws “until such time as the United States of America extend their jurisdiction over us.”	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Provisional_Government_of_Oregon_map.png/250px-Provisional_Government_of_Oregon_map.png
