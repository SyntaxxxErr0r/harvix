51.8	Project_Excelsior	Project Excelsior	Project Excelsior was a series of high-altitude parachute jumps made by Colonel (then Captain) Joseph Kittinger of the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1959 and 1960 to test the Beaupre multi-stage parachute system. In one of these jumps Kittinger set world records for the highest parachute jump, the longest parachute drogue fall and the fastest speed by a human through the atmosphere, all of which still stand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Kittinger-jump.jpg/200px-Kittinger-jump.jpg
