Rajguru was born in a place named Khed near Pune. It was later renamed as Rajgurunagar in his honor. He is best known as a colleague of Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev in the murder of a British police officer J.P. Saunders at Lahore in 1928 in order to take revenge for the death of veteran leader Lala Lajpat Rai due to excessive police beating. All three were convicted of the crime and hanged on March 23, 1931. They were cremated at Hussainiwala at the banks of Sutlej river in today's Ferozepur district of Punjab.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Statues_of_Bhagat_Singh%2C_Rajguru_and_Sukhdev.jpg/210px-Statues_of_Bhagat_Singh%2C_Rajguru_and_Sukhdev.jpg
