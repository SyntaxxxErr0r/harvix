35.43	Currier_and_Ives	Currier and Ives	Currier and Ives was a successful American printmaking firm headed by Nathaniel Currier (1813–1888) and James Merritt Ives (1824–1895). Based in New York City from 1834–1907, the prolific firm produced prints from paintings by fine artists as black and white lithographs that were hand colored. Lithographic prints could be reproduced quickly and purchased inexpensively, and the firm called itself "the Grand Central Depot for Cheap and Popular Prints" and advertised its lithographs as "colored engravings for the people."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Brush_for_the_lead2.jpg/300px-Brush_for_the_lead2.jpg
