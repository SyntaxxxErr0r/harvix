6.01	Vehicle_licence	Vehicle licence	In the UK, the vehicle licence, which is more commonly known as a tax disc, comes in the form of a paper disc three inches in diameter to be displayed on the vehicle, and is evidence that the necessary vehicle excise duty has been paid for the specific vehicle. It should be placed on the left side of the windscreen if it is a four wheeled vehicle, but if it is a two wheeled vehicle then it should be placed in a holder fixed onto the bodywork.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Tax_Disc_%281956%29.jpg
