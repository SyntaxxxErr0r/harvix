61.50	Liquorice	Liquorice	Liquorice or licorice is the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra from which a somewhat sweet flavour can be extracted. The liquorice plant is a legume (related to beans and peas) that is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is called Athimathuram (அதிமதுரம்) in Tamil, "Yashtimadhu" in Sanskrit and "Mulethi" in Northern India. It is not related to anise, star anise, or fennel, which are the sources of similar-tasting flavouring compounds. The word 'liquorice'/'licorice' is derived (via the Old French licoresse), from the Greek γλυκύρριζα (glukurrhiza), meaning "sweet root", from γλυκύς (glukus), "sweet" + ῥίζα (rhiza), "root".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Illustration_Glycyrrhiza_glabra0.jpg/220px-Illustration_Glycyrrhiza_glabra0.jpg
