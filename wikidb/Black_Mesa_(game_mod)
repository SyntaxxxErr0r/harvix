The stated goal of the project is to recreate Valve's critically acclaimed 1998 video game Half-Life using the more advanced capabilities of the Source Engine. The 40-person volunteer development team says they hope to create a more engrossing in-game world with more varied, complex environments and more challenging, realistic gameplay.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Black-mesa-logo.png/256px-Black-mesa-logo.png
