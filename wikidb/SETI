115.8	SETI	Search for extraterrestrial intelligence	The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is the collective name for a number of activities people undertake to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. Some of the most well known projects are run by Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley and the SETI Institute. SETI projects use scientific methods to search for intelligent life on other planets. For example, electromagnetic radiation is monitored for signs of transmissions from civilizations on other worlds. The United States government contributed to early SETI projects, but recent work has been primarily funded by private sources.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/SETI%40home_Multi-Beam_screensaver.png/300px-SETI%40home_Multi-Beam_screensaver.png
