51.0	Wah-wah_pedal	Wah-wah pedal	A wah-wah pedal (or just wah pedal) is a type of guitar effects pedal that alters the tone of the signal to create a distinctive effect, mimicking the human voice. The pedal sweeps the peak response of a filter up and down in frequency to create the sound , also known as "the wah effect." The wah-wah effect was originally intended to imitate the supposed crying tone that a muted trumpet produced, but became an expressive tool in its own way. It was, and is, used when a guitarist is soloing, or creating a "wacka-wacka" funk styled rhythm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/VOX_Wah-Wah_front.jpg/160px-VOX_Wah-Wah_front.jpg
