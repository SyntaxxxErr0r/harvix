55.1	Comstock_Lode	Comstock Lode	The Comstock Lode was the first major U.S. discovery of silver ore, located under what is now Virginia City, Nevada, on the eastern slope of Mount Davidson, a peak in the Virginia Range. After the discovery was made public in 1859, prospectors rushed to the area and scrambled to stake their claims. Mining camps soon thrived in the vicinity, which became bustling centers of fabulous wealth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Comstock_ore09.jpg/220px-Comstock_ore09.jpg
