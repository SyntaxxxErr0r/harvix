79.7	Corrosion	Corrosion	Corrosion is the gradual destruction of material, usually metal, by chemical reaction with its environment. In the most common use of the word, this means electrochemical oxidation of metals in reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen. Rusting, the formation of iron oxides, is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion. This type of damage typically produces oxide(s) or salt(s) of the original metal. Corrosion can also occur in materials other than metals, such as ceramics or polymers, although in this context, the term degradation is more common.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Rust_and_dirt.jpg/220px-Rust_and_dirt.jpg
