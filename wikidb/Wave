63.1	Wave	Wave	In physics, a wave is a disturbance or oscillation that travels through spacetime, accompanied by a transfer of energy. Waves travel and the wave motion transfers energy from one point to another, often with no permanent displacement of the particles of the mediumâ€”that is, with little or no associated mass transport. They consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations around almost fixed locations. For example, a cork on rippling water will bob up and down, staying in about the same place while the wave itself moves onwards. Waves are described by a wave equation which sets out how the disturbance proceeds over time. The mathematical form of this equation varies depending on the type of wave.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/2006-01-14_Surface_waves.jpg/300px-2006-01-14_Surface_waves.jpg
