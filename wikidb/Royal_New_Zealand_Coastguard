The New Zealand Police coordinate smaller search and rescue incidents (Class II) in New Zealand, with assistance and resources from the coastguard as required; major maritime incidents (Class III) are coordinated by the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ), who may call on the resources of the New Zealand Defence Force.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/New_Zealand_Coastguard_2008_logo.svg/250px-New_Zealand_Coastguard_2008_logo.svg.png
