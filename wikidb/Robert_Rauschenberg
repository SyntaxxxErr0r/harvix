133.6	Robert_Rauschenberg	Robert Rauschenberg	Robert Rauschenberg (October 22, 1925 â€“ May 12, 2008) was an American artist who came to prominence in the 1950s transition from Abstract Expressionism to Pop Art. Rauschenberg is well-known for his "Combines" of the 1950s, in which non-traditional materials and objects were employed in innovative combinations. Rauschenberg was both a painter and a sculptor and the Combines are a combination of both, but he also worked with photography, printmaking, papermaking, and performance. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1993.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Robert_Rauschenberg_1999.jpg/220px-Robert_Rauschenberg_1999.jpg
