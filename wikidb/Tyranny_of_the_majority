60.5	Tyranny_of_the_majority	Tyranny of the majority	The phrase "tyranny of the majority" (or "tyranny of the masses"), used in discussing systems of democracy and majority rule, envisions a scenario in which decisions made by a majority place its interests so far above those of an individual or minority group as to constitute active oppression, comparable to that of tyrants and despots. In many discussions, the purportedly oppressed minority is either the wealthy "few," a socially advantaged ethnic group, or a socially disadvantaged ethnic group.
