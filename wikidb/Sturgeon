57.1	Sturgeon	Sturgeon	Sturgeon is the common name used for some 26 species of fish in the family Acipenseridae, including the genera Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus. The term includes over 20 species commonly referred to as sturgeon and several closely related species that have distinct common names, notably sterlet, kaluga and beluga. Collectively, the family is also known as the true sturgeons. Sturgeon is sometimes used more exclusively to refer to the species in the two best-known genera, Acipenser and Huso.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Sturgeon2.jpg/250px-Sturgeon2.jpg
