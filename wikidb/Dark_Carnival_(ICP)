2.10	Dark_Carnival_(ICP)	Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)	Bruce describes the Dark Carnival as "a place where you have all the evil souls that are going to be going to hell." It features multiple rides and attractions which assist in this purpose, which are the focus of multiple albums and songs within the group's discography. Each of the Joker's Cards relate to a specific character — an entity of the Dark Carnival — that tries to "save the human soul" by showing the wickedness inside of one's self. Bang! Pow! Boom! was introduced in 2009 as the first of a set of six new Joker's Cards.
