51.6	Thrash_metal	Thrash metal	Thrash metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that is characterized usually by its fast tempo and aggression. Songs of the genre typically use fast percussive and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. Lyrics of thrash metal songs often deal with social issues, often using direct and denunciatory language, an approach which partially overlaps with the hardcore genre. The "Big Four" bands of thrash metal are Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax who simultaneously created and popularized the genre in the early 1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Venom_live_at_hellfest.jpg/220px-Venom_live_at_hellfest.jpg
