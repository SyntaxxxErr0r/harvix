10.31	Lowercase	Letter case	In orthography and typography, letter case (or just case) is the distinction between the larger majuscule and smaller minuscule (lower-case, etc.) letters. The term originated with the shallow drawers called type cases still used to hold the movable type for letterpress printing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/UPPER_CASE_-_lower_case.jpg/350px-UPPER_CASE_-_lower_case.jpg
