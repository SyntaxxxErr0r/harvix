177.9	Central_Asia	Central Asia	Central Asia is the core region of the Asian continent and stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north. It is also sometimes referred to as Middle Asia, and, colloquially, "the 'stans" (as the five countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with that suffix) and is within the scope of the wider Eurasian continent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Central_Asia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/200px-Central_Asia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png
