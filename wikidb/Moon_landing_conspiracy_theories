53.0	Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories	Moon landing conspiracy theories	Different Moon landing conspiracy theories claim that some or all elements of the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA and members of other organizations. Various groups and individuals have made such conspiracy claims since the end of the Apollo program in 1975. The most notable claim is that the six manned landings (1969â€“1972) were faked and that the Apollo astronauts did not walk on the Moon. The conspiracy theorists (henceforth conspiracists) argue that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened by manufacturing, destroying, or tampering with evidence; including photos, telemetry tapes, transmissions, rock samples, and even some key witnesses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Apollo_11_Crew_During_Training_Exercise_-_GPN-2002-000032.jpg/250px-Apollo_11_Crew_During_Training_Exercise_-_GPN-2002-000032.jpg
