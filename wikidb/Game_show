50.07	Game_show	Game show	A game show is a type of radio or television program in which members of the public, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles usually for money and/or prizes. On some shows contestants compete against other players or another team while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a good outcome or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Wheel_of_Fortune_Navy.jpg/220px-Wheel_of_Fortune_Navy.jpg
