88.7	Community_organizing	Community organizing	Community organizing is a process where people who live in proximity to each other come together into an organization that acts in their shared self-interest. A core goal of community organizing is to generate durable power for an organization representing the community, allowing it to influence key decision-makers on a range of issues over time. In the ideal, for example, this can get community organizing groups a place at the table before important decisions are made. Community organizers work with and develop new local leaders, facilitating coalitions and assisting in the development of campaigns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/ACORN_Protest.jpg/250px-ACORN_Protest.jpg
