59.4	Sadhu	Sadhu	In Hinduism, sādhu denotes an ascetic, wandering monk. Although the vast majority of sādhus are yogīs, not all yogīs are sādhus. The sādhu is solely dedicated to achieving mokṣa (liberation), the fourth and final aśrama (stage of life), through meditation and contemplation of brahman. Sādhus often wear ochre-colored clothing, symbolizing their sanyāsa (renunciation).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Sadhu_In_Haridwar.jpg/200px-Sadhu_In_Haridwar.jpg
