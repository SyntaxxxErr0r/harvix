59.6	Janjaweed	Janjaweed	The Janjaweed is a blanket term used to describe mostly gunmen in Darfur, western Sudan, and now eastern Chad. Using the United Nations definition, the Janjaweed comprised Sudanese Arab tribes, the core of whom are from the Abbala (camel herder) background with significant Lambo recruitment from the Baggara (cattle herder) people. This UN definition may not necessarily be accurate, as instances of members from other tribes have been noted.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Map_of_Darfur_2011.png/150px-Map_of_Darfur_2011.png
