The structure has been refurbished many times since its initial completion in 691 CE at the order of Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik. The site's significance stems from religious traditions regarding the rock, known as the Foundation Stone, at its heart.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/DomeOfTheRock053011.jpg/300px-DomeOfTheRock053011.jpg
