1.00	High_altitude_training	Altitude training	Altitude training is the practice by some endurance athletes of training for several weeks at high altitude, preferably over 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) above sea level, though more commonly at intermediate altitudes due to the shortage of suitable high-altitude locations. At intermediate altitudes, the air still contains approximately 20.9% oxygen, but the barometric pressure and thus the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/CS_190186.jpg/220px-CS_190186.jpg
