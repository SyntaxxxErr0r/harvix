8.00	Fiat_Seicento	Fiat Seicento	The Fiat Seicento is a city car produced by the Italian company Fiat, introduced in late 1997 as a replacement for the Fiat Cinquecento. The Seicento did not differ much from its predecessor, retaining the same engines, chassis and general dimensions, although it did gain a minor 9 cm in length (total length of 3.34 m). The design was similar too, in which the Seicento kept the same 3-door hatchback body, instead of the 5-door mini MPV look seen on many Korean and Japanese city cars, such as the Daewoo Matiz and Suzuki Wagon R. Like its predecessors, the Cinquecento and Polski Fiat 126, the Seicento was built in Fiat's factory in Tychy, Poland. From 1998 to April 2004, 1.1 million examples of the Seicento had been produced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/2004_Fiat_Seicento.JPG/250px-2004_Fiat_Seicento.JPG
