71.7	Ghost	Ghost	In traditional belief and fiction, a ghost is the soul or spirit of a deceased person or animal that can appear, in visible form or other manifestation, to the living. Descriptions of the apparition of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, life-like visions. The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy, or in spiritism as a s√©ance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Brown_lady.jpg/250px-Brown_lady.jpg
