278.0	Intelligent_design	Intelligent design	Intelligent design is the proposition that "certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection." It is a form of creationism and a contemporary adaptation of the traditional teleological argument for the existence of God, presented by its advocates as "an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins" rather than "a religious-based idea". The leading proponents of intelligent design are associated with the Discovery Institute, a politically conservative think tank,n 1 and believe the designer to be the Christian God.n 2	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/BwcOmega911a.jpg/180px-BwcOmega911a.jpg
