105.0	Mondegreen	Mondegreen	Luis van Rooten produced a volume of pseudo-French poetry, Mots D'Heures: Gousses, Rames (sounds like "Mother Goose Rhymes"), complete with critical, historical and interpretive apparatus, which are actually elaborate, extended mondegreens for English-language nursery rhymes. This can also be considered soramimi, which produces different meanings when interpreted in another language.
