77.8	Thabo_Mbeki	Thabo Mbeki	Thabo Mvuyelwa Mbeki (pronunciation: ; born 18 June 1942) is a South African politician who served two terms as the second post-apartheid President of South Africa from 14 June 1999 to 24 September 2008. He is also the brother of Moeletsi Mbeki. On 20 September 2008, he announced his resignation after being recalled by the African National Congress's National Executive Committee, following a conclusion by Judge Nicholson of improper interference in the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), including the prosecution of Jacob Zuma for corruption. On 12 January 2009, the Supreme Court of Appeal unanimously overturned Judge Nicholsonâ€™s judgment but the resignation stood.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/SthAfrica.ThaboMbeki.01.jpg/230px-SthAfrica.ThaboMbeki.01.jpg
