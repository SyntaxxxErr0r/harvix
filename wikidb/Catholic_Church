138.8	Catholic_Church	Catholic Church	The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is, with over a billion members, the world's largest Christian church. Led by the Pope, it defines its mission as spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ, administering its sacraments and exercising charity. It teaches that it is the one true church founded by Jesus Christ, that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles and that the Pope is the sole successor to Saint Peter.note 1note 2	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/StPetersBasilicaEarlyMorning.jpg/230px-StPetersBasilicaEarlyMorning.jpg
