133.7	Srebrenica_massacre	Srebrenica massacre	The Srebrenica massacre, also known as the Srebrenica genocide, refers to the July 1995 killing, during the Bosnian War, of more than 8,000 Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), mainly men and boys, in and around the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by units of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of General Ratko MladiÄ‡. The mass murder was described by the Secretary-General of the United Nations as the worst crime on European soil since the Second World War. A paramilitary unit from Serbia known as the Scorpions, officially part of the Serbian Interior Ministry until 1991, participated in the massacre and it is alleged that foreign volunteers including the Greek Volunteer Guard also participated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Srebrenica_massacre_memorial_gravestones_2009_1.jpg/220px-Srebrenica_massacre_memorial_gravestones_2009_1.jpg
