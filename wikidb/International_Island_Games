The IGA liaises with the member island associations and with sponsors of the games. It investigates whether islands wanting to join fit the membership criteria. Any further additions since Minorca joined in 2005 will now require changes to the constitution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Iga-logo-large.png
