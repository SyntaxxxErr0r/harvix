Being a new world country, Canada has been predisposed to be a very open society with regards to immigration, which has been the most important factor in its historical population growth. Canadians make up 0.5% of the world's total population.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Population_Canada_ver_4.png/400px-Population_Canada_ver_4.png
