12.11	Super_8_film_cameras	Super 8 film cameras	A Super 8mm camera is a motion picture camera specifically manufactured to utilise the Super 8mm motion picture format. Super 8mm film cameras were first manufactured in 1965 by Kodak for their newly-introduced amateur film format, which replaced the Standard 8 mm film format. Manufacture continued until the popularity of video cameras in the early 1980s. The cameras are no longer professionally manufactured (although used cameras may be restored and sold) and most cameras readily available are used from the 1960s and 1970s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Canon1014XL-S.jpg/220px-Canon1014XL-S.jpg
