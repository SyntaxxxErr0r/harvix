67.2	Arctic	Arctic	The Arctic ( or ) is a polar region located at the northern-most part of the Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean and parts of Canada, Russia, Greenland, the United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean, surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as north of the Arctic Circle (66Â° 33'N), the approximate limit of the midnight sun and the polar night. Alternatively, it can be defined as the region where the average temperature for the warmest month (July) is below ; the northernmost tree line roughly follows the isotherm at the boundary of this region.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Arctic_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/220px-Arctic_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png
