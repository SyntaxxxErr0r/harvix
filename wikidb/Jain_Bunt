1.00	Jain_Bunt	Jain Bunt	The Jain Bunt (Tulu: ) are a Jain community of erstwhile nobility and gentry from the region of Tulu Nadu in the southwest of India which comprises the districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada in the Indian state of Karnataka and the Kasaragod taluk of Kerala. The Jain Bunts are traditionally defined as a distinctive subdivision of the Bunt community. They are a classified forward caste, and according to the Indian census of 2001, though not specifically mentioning the Jain Bunts, it was found that people who follow Jainism in India have the highest literacy rate, 94.1% compared with the national average of 65.38%. They have the highest female literacy rate, 90.6% compared with the national average of 54.16%. It is believed that the Jains also have the highest per capita income in India. The Jain Bunts are traditionally matrilineal and probably the only Jains to do so. The Jain Bunts have a feudal and martial heritage, and many erstwhile royalty of the Tulu Nadu region were Jain Bunts. In Karnataka, people who follow Jainism formed 0.78% of the population, according to 2001 census. However, the majority of Jains in Karnataka today are recent migrants from North India. The Jain Bunts are a minority, even among this population. However, their exact number is largely unavailable. It is estimated they are less than 50,000 in number.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Chandayya_Heggade.jpg/107px-Chandayya_Heggade.jpg
