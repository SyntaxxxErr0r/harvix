178.2	Library_of_Alexandria	Library of Alexandria	The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323–283 BC) or during the reign of his son Ptolemy II (283–246 BC).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Alexandria_Library_Inscription.jpg/220px-Alexandria_Library_Inscription.jpg
