102.8	Phenotype	Phenotype	A phenotype (from Greek phainein, 'to show' + typos, 'type') is the composite of an organism's observable characteristics or traits: such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, phenology, behavior, and products of behavior (such as a bird's nest). Phenotypes result from the expression of an organism's genes as well as the influence of environmental factors and the interactions between the two.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Coquina_variation3.jpg/250px-Coquina_variation3.jpg
