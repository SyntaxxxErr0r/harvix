4.00	Protogynous	Sequential hermaphroditism	Sequential hermaphroditism (called dichogamy in botany) is a type of hermaphroditism that occurs in many fish, gastropods and plants. Here, the individual is born one sex and changes sex at some point in their life. They can change from a male to female , or from female to male (protogyny). Despite which sex the organism changes to, those that change gonadal sex can have both female and male germ cells in the gonads or can change from one complete gonadal type to the other during their last life stage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Anemone_purple_anemonefish.jpg/220px-Anemone_purple_anemonefish.jpg
