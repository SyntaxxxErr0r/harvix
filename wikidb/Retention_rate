6.10	Retention_rate	Retention rate	Retention Rate (also called earnings retention ratio, plowback ratio) is the proportion of net income that is not paid in dividends. A firm earning $80 million after taxes and paying dividends of $20 million has a retention rate of $60 million/$80 million, or 75%. A high retention rate makes it more likely a firm's income and dividends will grow in future years. It's often expressed as a percentage.
