The formation consists of a number of hoodoos, described as a "set of narrowly-tapered rock columns....topped with a large rock balanced neatly on the tip." In French, such structures are referred to as Demoiselles Coiffées ("ladies with hairdos").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/DemoisellesCoiff%C3%A9esPontis.jpg/280px-DemoisellesCoiff%C3%A9esPontis.jpg
