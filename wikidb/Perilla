The leaves resemble stinging nettle leaves, but are slightly rounder in shape. Its essential oils provide for a strong taste whose intensity might be compared to that of mint or fennel. It is considered rich in minerals and vitamins, has anti-inflammatory properties, and is thought to help preserve and sterilize other foods. Like basil and coleus, it is a member of the mint family.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Green_shiso_perilla.jpg/220px-Green_shiso_perilla.jpg
