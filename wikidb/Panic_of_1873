54.9	Panic_of_1873	Panic of 1873	The Panic of 1873 triggered a severe international economic depression in both Europe and the United States that lasted until 1879, and even longer in some countries. The depression was known as the Great Depression until the 1930s, but is now known as the Long Depression. The panic was caused by the fall in demand for silver internationally, which followed Germany's decision to abandon the silver standard in the wake of the Franco-Prussian war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Panic_of_1873_bank_run.jpg/300px-Panic_of_1873_bank_run.jpg
