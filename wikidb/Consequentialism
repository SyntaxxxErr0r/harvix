71.6	Consequentialism	Consequentialism	Ethical egoism can be understood as a consequentialist theory according to which the consequences for the individual agent are taken to matter more than any other result. Thus, egoism will prescribe actions that may be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to the welfare of others. Some, like Henry Sidgwick, argue that a certain degree of egoism promotes the general welfare of society for two reasons: because individuals know how to please themselves best, and because if everyone were an austere altruist then general welfare would inevitably decrease.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/JohnStuartMill.jpg/220px-JohnStuartMill.jpg
