2.12	Systemic_Lupus_Erythematosus	Systemic lupus erythematosus	Systemic lupus erythematosus , often abbreviated to SLE or lupus, is a systemic autoimmune disease (or autoimmune connective tissue disease) that can affect any part of the body. As occurs in other autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the body's cells and tissue, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. It is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction caused by antibody-immune complex formation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Butterflyrash.jpg/230px-Butterflyrash.jpg
