3.00	Inside_the_CIA	Inside the CIA	"Inside the CIA" (titled American Dad: The New CIA on DVD) was a short film for the television program American Dad!. It featured the main cast in some shenanigans in front of Stan Smith's video camera. It was shown in theatres with Fever Pitch on April 8, 2005, to promote the show. Besides the series pilot, "Inside the CIA" was the first episode of American Dad! to be aired. In another similarity to the pilot, Inside the CIA features a cutaway. Although a hallmark of Family Guy, American Dad! almost never uses cutaways.
