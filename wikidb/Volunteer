65.7	Volunteer	Volunteering	Volunteering is generally considered an altruistic activity, intended to promote good or improve human quality of life, but people also volunteer for their own skill development, to meet others, to make contacts for possible employment, to have fun, and a variety of other reasons that could be considered self-serving. Volunteerism is the act of selflessly giving your life to something you believe free of pay. Although if a person volunteers they may not earn money, it produces a feeling of self-worth and volunteers earn respect and Favors instead of money.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/HandsOnMiamiVolunteersZooMiami.jpg/220px-HandsOnMiamiVolunteersZooMiami.jpg
