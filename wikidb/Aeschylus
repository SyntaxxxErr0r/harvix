94.6	Aeschylus	Aeschylus	Aeschylus (Greek: , Aiskhulos; c. 525/524 BC â€“ c. 456/455 BC) was the first of the three ancient Greek tragedians whose plays can still be read or performed, the others being Sophocles and Euripides. He is often described as the father of tragedy: our knowledge of the genre begins with his work and our understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in plays to allow for conflict amongst them whereas, previously, characters had interacted only with the chorus. nb 1	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Aischylos_B%C3%BCste.jpg/220px-Aischylos_B%C3%BCste.jpg
