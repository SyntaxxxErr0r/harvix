36.12	Night	Night	Night or nighttime is the period of time between the sunset and the sunrise when the Sun is below the horizon. This occurs after dusk. The opposite of night is day (or "daytime" to distinguish it from "day" as used for a 24-hour period). The start and end points of time of a night vary based on factors such as season, latitude, longitude and timezone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Rainbow_colored_Rainbow_Bridge_at_night.jpg/220px-Rainbow_colored_Rainbow_Bridge_at_night.jpg
