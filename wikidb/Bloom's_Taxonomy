84.9	Bloom's_Taxonomy	Bloom's Taxonomy	Bloom's Taxonomy is a classification of learning objectives within education proposed in 1956 by a committee of educators chaired by Benjamin Bloom who also edited the first volume of the standard text, Taxonomy of educational objectives: the classification of educational goals (referred to as simply "the Handbook" below). Although named for Bloom, the publication followed a series of conferences from 1949 to 1953, which were designed to improve communication between educators on the design of curricula and examinations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Blooms_rose.svg/350px-Blooms_rose.svg.png
