56.9	Scattering	Scattering	Scattering is a general physical process where some forms of radiation, such as light, sound, or moving particles, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by one or more localized non-uniformities in the medium through which they pass. In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection. Reflections that undergo scattering are often called diffuse reflections and unscattered reflections are called specular (mirror-like) reflections	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Electron-scattering.png/150px-Electron-scattering.png
