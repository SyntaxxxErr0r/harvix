253.1	C%2B%2B	C++	C++ is a statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm, compiled, general-purpose programming language. It is regarded as an intermediate-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs as an enhancement to the C language. Originally named C with Classes, the language was renamed C++ in 1983, as a pun involving the increment operator.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/C_plus_plus_book.jpg/160px-C_plus_plus_book.jpg
