74.6	Capsicum	Capsicum	The fruit of most species of Capsicum contains capsaicin (methyl vanillyl nonenamide), a lipophilic chemical that can produce a strong burning sensation in the mouth of the unaccustomed eater. Most mammals find this unpleasant, whereas birds are unaffected. The secretion of capsaicin protects the fruit from consumption by mammals while the bright colors attract birds that will disperse the seeds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Red_capsicum_and_cross_section.jpg/220px-Red_capsicum_and_cross_section.jpg
