Seán FitzPatrick subsequently resigned his position and was followed within twenty-four hours by the bank's non-executive director, Lar Bradshaw and chief executive, David Drumm. A new chairman of Anglo, Donal O'Connor, was quickly appointed from the board, a move welcomed by the Irish Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan. A number of investigations have been launched into the reasons behind the three resignations. The Central Bank of Ireland is carrying out a review of the bank's dealings, although its head of the Financial Regulation, Patrick Neary, has also since resigned his position. So too have a number of other chairmen, directors and executives involved with Anglo, Irish Life and Permanent and Irish Nationwide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Protest_against_bailout_of_Anglo_Irish_Bank.jpg/220px-Protest_against_bailout_of_Anglo_Irish_Bank.jpg
