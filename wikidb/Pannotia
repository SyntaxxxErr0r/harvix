Dalziel in 1997, is a hypothetical supercontinent that existed from the Pan-African orogeny about six hundred million years ago to the end of the Precambrian about five hundred and fifty million years ago. It is also known as the Vendian supercontinent. After that, it split into the islands of Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica, with the main landmass, Gondwana, south of it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Positions_of_ancient_continents%2C_550_million_years_ago.jpg/300px-Positions_of_ancient_continents%2C_550_million_years_ago.jpg
