2.00	Kaufmann%E2%80%93Bucherer%E2%80%93Neumann_experiments	Kaufmann–Bucherer–Neumann experiments	In 1902, Max Abraham published a theory based on the assumption that the electron was a rigid, perfect sphere, with its charge being distributed evenly on its surface. He also showed the earlier calculations of Searle are incomplete, since they only give the correct expression for the electron's energy and mass in the direction of motion – the "longitudinale electromagnetic mass". Abraham showed, that the expression for mass is different at right angles to the direction of motion (which was actually measured by Kaufmann), so he introduced the so-called "transverse electromagnetic mass". Consequently he demonstrated that Kaufmann's results are in full agreement with this predictions. Both Kaufmann and Abraham concluded that only electromagnetic mass exists, while the assumption of a constant Newtonian mass isn't necessary any more.A 5A 6	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Abraham-Lorentz-Bucherer.svg/300px-Abraham-Lorentz-Bucherer.svg.png
