63.1	Audio_mastering	Audio mastering	In the 1990s, electro-mechanical processes were largely superseded by digital technology, with digital recordings stored on HDDs or Digital Tape and transferred to CD. The digital audio workstation (DAW) became common in many mastering facilities, allowing the off-line manipulation of recorded audio via a graphical user interface (GUI). Although many digital processing tools are common during mastering, it is also very common to use analog media and processing equipment for the mastering stage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Optimum-mix-levels-for-mast.jpg/240px-Optimum-mix-levels-for-mast.jpg
