66.4	Craft	Craft	A craft is a profession that requires some particular kind of skilled work. In a historical sense, particularly as pertinent to the Middle Ages and earlier, the term is usually applied to people occupied in small-scale production of goods. The traditional terms craftsman and craftswoman are nowadays often replaced by artisan and rarely by craftsperson (craftspeople).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/MorganWoodworking.jpg/300px-MorganWoodworking.jpg
