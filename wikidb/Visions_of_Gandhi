4.00	Visions_of_Gandhi	Visions of Gandhi	Visions of Gandhi is the 3rd album from underground hip hop group Jedi Mind Tricks. Jus Allah split from the group after the release of their album Violent by Design (2000), returning the group back to its original lineup of Vinnie Paz and Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. Producer Stoupe expands his dark sounds, including beats with grand orchestral samples and Latin-tinged production. Vinnie Paz lessens his lyrical topics to focus on his thug persona. Album guests include Canibus, Kool G Rap, Percee P, Ras Kass, and Tragedy Khadafi, as well as underground peers Crypt the Warchild, Planetary of Outerspace, and Non Phixion members Ill Bill, Sabac Red, and Goretex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Visionsofgandhi.jpg
