34.90	Play_therapy	Play therapy	Play therapy is generally employed with children aged 3 through 11 and provides a way for them to express their experiences and feelings through a natural, self-guided, self-healing process. As childrenâ€™s experiences and knowledge are often communicated through play, it becomes an important vehicle for them to know and accept themselves and others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Sandspiel1.jpg/220px-Sandspiel1.jpg
