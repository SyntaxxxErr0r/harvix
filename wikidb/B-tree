60.7	B-tree	B-tree	In computer science, a B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. The B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children. (Comer 1979, p. 123) Unlike self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data. It is commonly used in databases and filesystems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/B-tree.svg/400px-B-tree.svg.png
