1.00	Belgaroth	List of Star Wars planets (Aâ€“B)	Alderaan, seen in Episode III briefly at the end and IV from outer space, was the home of Princess Leia Organa, Bail Organa, and also, in 4000 BBY, Ulic Qel-Droma, who fought in the Great Sith War. Its name is actually an archaic and disused astronomical name (see Alderaan (real)). Alderaan was known for its peaceful and nature-conscious citizens and vibrant, melodic culture. The planet's citizens had no weapons, and space pilots had to have port authorities hold theirs while they were on the planet. Despite the fact that they had a planetary shield system, Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star in 0 BBY. The planet was similar to Chandrila, Naboo, Dantooine, and also resembled Earth. Animals native to Alderaan included the nerf and the thranta, examples of which still survive on other planets.
