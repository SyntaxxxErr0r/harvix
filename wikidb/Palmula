1.00	Palmula	Palmula	Palmula is an extinct genus of foraminifera which is known from a number of species found in rocks dating from near the beginning of the Jurassic to the end of the Cretaceous, in Africa, Asia, Europe, and New Zealand. A genus of polycotylid plesiosaur was named Palmula in 2007, but because the name was already in use, the plesiosaur was renamed, becoming Palmulasaurus.
