1.00	Hamas-Fatah_conflict	Fatah–Hamas conflict	The Fatah–Hamas conflict , also referred to as the Palestinian Civil War (Arabic: الحرب الأهلية الفلسطينية al-Ḥarb al-ʾAhliyyah al-Filisṭīnīyyah), and the Conflict of Brothers (Arabic: صراع الإخوة Ṣirāʿ al-ʾIkhwah), i.e., fratricidal war (The conflict is called Wakseh among Palestinians, meaning humiliation, ruin, and collapse as a result of self-inflicted damage.), began in 2006, after Hamas's legislative victories and has continued, politically and sometimes militarily up to this day. The conflict, which erupted between the two main Palestinian parties, Fatah and Hamas, resulted in the split of Palestinian Authority into two polities, both seeing themselves the true representatives of the Palestinian people - the Fatah ruled Palestinian National Authority and the Hamas Government in Gaza.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Gz-map.png/300px-Gz-map.png
