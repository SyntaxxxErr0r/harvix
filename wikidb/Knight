67.0	Knight	Knight	A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe knighthood, has been conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Since the Early Modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Armored_Knight_Mounted_on_Cloaked_Horse.JPG/260px-Armored_Knight_Mounted_on_Cloaked_Horse.JPG
