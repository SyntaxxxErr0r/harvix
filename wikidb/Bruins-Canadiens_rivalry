1.00	Bruins-Canadiens_rivalry	Bruins–Canadiens rivalry	The rivalry between the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League is considered "one of the greatest rivalries in sports," along with the Yankees–Red Sox and Bears–Packers rivalries. The two teams have played each other more times, in both regular season play and the playoffs combined, than any other two teams in NHL history, though the Blackhawks and Red Wings have played against each other in more regular season games.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Cherry_Maclean2.jpg/170px-Cherry_Maclean2.jpg
