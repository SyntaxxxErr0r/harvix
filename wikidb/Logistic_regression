77.1	Logistic_regression	Logistic regression	In statistics, logistic regression (sometimes called the logistic model or logit model) is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the outcome of a binary dependent variable (a variable which can take only two possible outcomes, e.g. "yes" vs. "no" or "success" vs. "failure") based on one or more predictor variables. Logistic regression attempts to model the probability of a "yes/success" outcome using a linear function of the predictors. Specifically, the log-odds of success (the logit of the probability) is fit to the predictors using linear regression. Logistic regression is one type of discrete choice model, which in general predict categorical dependent variables â€” either binary or multi-way.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Logistic-curve.svg/320px-Logistic-curve.svg.png
