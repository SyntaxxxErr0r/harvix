1.10	Menuetto	Minuet	A minuet, also spelled menuet, is a social dance of French origin for two people, usually in 3/4 time. The word was adapted from Italian minuetto and French menuet, and may have been from French menu meaning slender, small, referring to the very small steps, or from the early 17th-century popular group dances called branle Ã  mener or amener.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Minuet_%28PSF%29.png/220px-Minuet_%28PSF%29.png
