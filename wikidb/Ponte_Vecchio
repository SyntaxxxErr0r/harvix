73.8	Ponte_Vecchio	Ponte Vecchio	The Ponte Vecchio ("Old Bridge", Italian pronunciation: ) is a Medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno River, in Florence, Italy, noted for still having shops built along it, as was once common. Butchers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewellers, art dealers and souvenir sellers. The Ponte Vecchio's two neighbouring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Ponte alle Grazie.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Italy_and_Greece_105.jpg/250px-Italy_and_Greece_105.jpg
