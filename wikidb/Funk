152.1	Funk	Funk	Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid-late 1960s when African American musicians blended soul music, jazz and R&amp;B into a rhythmic, danceable new form of music. Funk de-emphasizes melody and harmony and brings a strong rhythmic groove of electric bass and drums to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing it from R&amp;B and soul songs, which are centered on chord progressions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/James-Brown_1973.jpg/265px-James-Brown_1973.jpg
