Released in 1997, the game sparked the release of a collection of media centered around the game entitled the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. The discography of the Final Fantasy VII series includes not only the albums based on the soundtrack to the original game, but also the music albums released for the titles in the collection. The first album produced was Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack, a compilation of all the music in the game. It was released as a soundtrack album on four CDs by DigiCube in 1997. A selection of tracks from the album was released in the single-disc Reunion Tracks by DigiCube the same year. Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII, an album featuring piano arrangements of pieces from the soundtrack, was released in 2003 by DigiCube, and Square Enix began reprinting all three albums in 2004. To date, these are the only released albums based on the original game's soundtrack, and were solely composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu; his role for the majority of subsequent albums has been filled by Masashi Hamauzu and Takeharu Ishimoto.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Nobuo_Uematsu_-_Paris_4-dec-2004.JPG/220px-Nobuo_Uematsu_-_Paris_4-dec-2004.JPG
