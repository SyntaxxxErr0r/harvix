70.4	Revolver_(album)	Revolver (album)	Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band The Beatles, released on 5 August 1966 on the Parlophone label and produced by George Martin. Many of the tracks on Revolver are marked by an electric guitar-rock sound, in contrast with their previous LP, the folk rock inspired Rubber Soul (1965). In Britain, the fourteen tracks from Revolver were released to radio stations throughout July 1966, "building anticipation for what would clearly be a radical new phase in the group's recording career".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/Revolver.jpg/220px-Revolver.jpg
