145.9	Phonograph	Phonograph	The phonograph, record player, or gramophone (from the Greek: , gramma, "letter" and φωνή, phōnē, "voice"), is a device introduced in 1877 that has had continued common use for reproducing (playing) sound recordings; although when first developed, the phonograph was used to both record and reproduce sounds. The recordings played on such a device generally consist of wavy lines that are either scratched, engraved, or grooved onto a rotating cylinder or disc. As the cylinder or disc rotates, a stylus or needle traces the wavy lines and vibrates to reproduce the recorded sound waves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/EdisonPhonograph.jpg/230px-EdisonPhonograph.jpg
