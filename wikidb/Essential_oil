113.9	Essential_oil	Essential oil	An essential oil is a concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile aroma compounds from plants. Essential oils are also known as volatile oils, ethereal oils or aetherolea, or simply as the "oil of" the plant from which they were extracted, such as oil of clove. An oil is "essential" in the sense that it carries a distinctive scent, or essence, of the plant. Essential oils do not form a distinctive category for any medical, pharmacological, or culinary purpose.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/SandalwoodEssOil.png/220px-SandalwoodEssOil.png
