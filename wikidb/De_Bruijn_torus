1.00	De_Bruijn_torus	De Bruijn torus	In combinatorial mathematics, a De Bruijn torus, named after Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn, is an array of symbols from an alphabet (often just 0 and 1) that contains every m-by-n matrix exactly once. It is a torus because the edges are considered wraparound for the purpose of finding matrices. Its name comes from the De Bruijn sequence, which can be considered a special case where n is 1 (one dimension).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/65/2-2-4-4-de-Bruijn-torus.svg/220px-2-2-4-4-de-Bruijn-torus.svg.png
