15.21	Guanosine_triphosphate	Guanosine triphosphate	Guanosine-5'-triphosphate is a purine nucleoside triphosphate. It can act as a substrate for the synthesis of RNA during the transcription process. Its structure is similar to that of the guanine nucleobase, the only difference being that nucleotides like GTP have a ribose sugar and three phosphates, with the nucleobase attached to the 1' and the triphosphate moiety attached to the 5' carbons of the ribose.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Guanosintriphosphat_protoniert.svg/200px-Guanosintriphosphat_protoniert.svg.png
