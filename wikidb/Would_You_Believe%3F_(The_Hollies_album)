1.00	Would_You_Believe%3F_(The_Hollies_album)	Would You Believe? (The Hollies album)	Would You Believe? is an album by the Hollies, released in 1966. It features a cover of Simon and Garfunkel's "I Am a Rock," which displayed progression for the band at the timeâ€”the rising folk-rock nascent was on the horizon. However, Would You Believe also features a cover of Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen" - by 1966, R&amp;B and blues covers were becoming passe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/The_hollies_would_you_believe.jpg/220px-The_hollies_would_you_believe.jpg
