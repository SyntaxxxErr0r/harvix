52.2	National_Security_Letter	National security letter	A national security letter (NSL) is a form of administrative subpoena used by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation and reportedly by other U.S. government agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense. They require no probable cause or judicial oversight. An NSL is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various record and data pertaining to individuals. NSLs can only request non-content information, such as transactional records, phone numbers dialed or email addresses mailed to and from. They also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from disclosing that the letter was ever issued. The gag order was ruled unconstitutional as an infringement of free speech, in the Doe v. Gonzales case. From 2003 to 2006 the bureau issued 192,499 national security letter requests.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/EFF-IA_National_Security_Letter_1.PNG/250px-EFF-IA_National_Security_Letter_1.PNG
