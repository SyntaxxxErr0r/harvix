87.6	Warsaw	Warsaw	Warsaw is an Alpha- global city, a major international tourist destination and an important economic hub in Central and Eastern Europe. It is also known as the "phoenix city" because it has survived many wars throughout its history. Most notably, the city had to be painstakingly rebuilt after the extensive damage it suffered from World War II, during which 80% of its buildings were destroyed. On 9 November 1940 the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, for the Siege of Warsaw (1939).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Collage_of_views_of_Warsaw_1_with_Stadium.png/250px-Collage_of_views_of_Warsaw_1_with_Stadium.png
