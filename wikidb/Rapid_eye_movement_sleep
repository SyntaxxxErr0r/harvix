55.8	Rapid_eye_movement_sleep	Rapid eye movement sleep	Rapid eye movement sleep is a normal stage of sleep characterized by the rapid and random movement of the eyes. REM sleep is classified into two categories: tonic and phasic. It was identified and defined by Nathaniel Kleitman, Eugene Aserinsky, and Jon Birtwell in the early 1950s. Criteria for REM sleep includes rapid eye movement, but also low muscle tone and a rapid, low-voltage EEG; these features are easily discernible in a polysomnogram , the sleep study typically done for patients with suspected sleep disorders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/REM.png/300px-REM.png
