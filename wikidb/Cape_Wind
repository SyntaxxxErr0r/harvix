52.7	Cape_Wind	Cape Wind	The Cape Wind Project is an approved offshore wind farm, on Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound off Cape Cod in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, proposed by a private developer, Cape Wind Associates, the brainchild of Jim Gordon and a Limited Liability Company (LLC) set up as a joint business venture between Energy Management Inc. and Wind Management LLP. Great controversy has surrounded the project, and if it moves forward on schedule, the wind farm may become the first offshore wind energy project in United States coastal waters. The project has been fought by the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, formed in 2001 to oppose the proposal because it will construct 400-foot (120 m) tall wind turbines in the middle of environmentally sensitive Nantucket Sound. The project is expected to cost $2.5 billion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/USA_Massachusetts_location_map.svg/235px-USA_Massachusetts_location_map.svg.png
