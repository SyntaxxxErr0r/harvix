80.8	Medium-density_fibreboard	Medium-density fibreboard	Medium-density fibreboard is an engineered wood product formed by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres, often in a defibrator, combining it with wax and a resin binder, and forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure. MDF is denser than plywood. It is made up of separated fibres, but can be used as a building material similar in application to plywood. It is stronger and much more dense than normal particle board.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/MDF_Sample.jpg/220px-MDF_Sample.jpg
