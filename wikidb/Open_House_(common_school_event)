1.00	Open_House_(common_school_event)	Open house (common school event)	An "open house", or as it is more often called "Open Day", is an event held at an institution where its doors are open to the general public to allow people to have a look around it in order to gain information on it. These are often held at schools and universities in the United States, Australia, United Kingdom and Canada, to attract prospective students, familiarise them (and their parents) with facilities, allow new students to become familiar with facilities and meet others, or to open informal communication channels between school staff and students and parents.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/OpenHouse.jpg/200px-OpenHouse.jpg
