32.52	Adar	Adar	Adar is the sixth month of the civil year and the twelfth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. It is a winter month of 29 days. In leap years, it is preceded by a 30-day intercalary month named Adar Aleph (Aleph being the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet), Adar Rishon (First Adar) or Adar I and it is then itself called Adar Bet (Bet being the second letter of the Hebrew Alphabet), Adar Sheni (Second Adar) or Adar II. Occasionally instead of Adar I and Adar II, "Adar" and "Ve'Adar" are used (Ve means 'and' thus: And Adar). Adar I and II occur during Februaryâ€“March on the Gregorian calendar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Purim_carnival_in_Tel_Aviv_%28cropped%29_1934.png/215px-Purim_carnival_in_Tel_Aviv_%28cropped%29_1934.png
