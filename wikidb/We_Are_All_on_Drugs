1.00	We_Are_All_on_Drugs	We Are All on Drugs	"We Are All on Drugs" is a song by American alternative rock band Weezer. It was released as the second single from the band's 2005 album, Make Believe. Contrary to popular belief, the song is not specifically about drugs. Rather, Rivers Cuomo claims that it is more generally about the over-stimulated society addicted to the internet, gambling, drugs and relationships.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/We_Are_All_on_Drugs_-_Cover_Art.jpg/220px-We_Are_All_on_Drugs_-_Cover_Art.jpg
