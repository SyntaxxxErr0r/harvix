2.01	Thrusting	Thrust	Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton's second and third laws. When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on that system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Aeroforces.svg/220px-Aeroforces.svg.png
