155.2	Wind_turbine	Wind turbine	A wind turbine is a device that converts kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy. If the mechanical energy is used to produce electricity, the device may be called a wind generator or wind charger. If the mechanical energy is used to drive machinery, such as for grinding grain or pumping water, the device is called a windmill or wind pump. Developed for over a millennium, today's wind turbines are manufactured in a range of vertical and horizontal axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging or auxiliary power on sailing boats; while large grid-connected arrays of turbines are becoming an increasingly large source of commercial electric power.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Windmills_D1-D4_%28Thornton_Bank%29.jpg/220px-Windmills_D1-D4_%28Thornton_Bank%29.jpg
