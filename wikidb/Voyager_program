65.6	Voyager_program	Voyager program	The Voyager program is a U.S program that launched two unmanned space missions, scientific probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment of the late 1970s. Although officially designated to study just Jupiter and Saturn, the probes were able to continue their mission into the outer solar system, and are as of December 2011 on course to exit the solar system. These probes were built at JPL and were funded by NASA. Voyager 1 is the farthest human-made object from Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Voyager_Path.svg/220px-Voyager_Path.svg.png
