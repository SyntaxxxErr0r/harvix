6.80	German_orthography	German orthography	German orthography, although largely phonemic, shows many instances of spellings that are historic or analogous to other spellings rather than phonemic. The pronunciation of almost every word can be derived from its spelling, once the spelling rules are known, but the opposite is not generally the case. Today, German orthography is regulated by the Rat f√ºr deutsche Rechtschreibung (RdR; German for "Council for German Orthography").
