This theory reached its zenith in 1990, when the factor "predicted" that the Oakland Athletics were "doomed" in that year's World Series, and the A's were swept by the Cincinnati Reds in a stunning upset (coincidentally, then Reds manager Lou Piniella became the Cubs manager later on). In the 2001 World Series, however, the Arizona Diamondbacks faced the Yankees with three ex-Cubs on their roster and not only won the Series in dramatic fashion, but won it on a rally started by Mark Grace, an ex-Cub, and ended with a base hit by Luis Gonzalez, another ex-Cub, effectively discrediting the "Ex-Cubs" theory. (at least on an anecdotal basis). The only other time a team of numerous ex-Cubs won the World Series was in the 1960 World Series where the Pittsburgh Pirates also defeated the Yankees in dramatic fashion off of Bill Mazeroski's homerun in Game 7. The 1960 series occurred before the theory had been coined.
