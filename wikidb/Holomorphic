8.10	Holomorphic	Holomorphic function	In mathematics, holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis. A holomorphic function is a complex-valued function of one or more complex variables that is complex differentiable in a neighborhood of every point in its domain. The existence of a complex derivative is a very strong condition, for it implies that any holomorphic function is actually infinitely differentiable and equal to its own Taylor series.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Conformal_map.svg/220px-Conformal_map.svg.png
