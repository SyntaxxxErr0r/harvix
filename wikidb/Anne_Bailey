8.10	Anne_Bailey	Anne Bailey	"Mad" Anne Bailey (1742 â€“ November 22, 1825) was a famous story teller and frontier scout who served in the fights of the American Revolutionary War and Northwest Indian War. Her single person ride in search of an urgently needed powder supply for the endangered Clendenin's Settlement (present-day Charleston, West Virginia) was used as the template for Charles Robb's 1861 poem Anne Bailey's Ride. She is known as the Heroine of the Kanawha Valley.
