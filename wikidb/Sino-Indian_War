57.7	Sino-Indian_War	Sino-Indian War	The Sino-Indian War , was a war between China and India that occurred in 1962. A disputed Himalayan border was the main pretext for war, but other issues played a role. There had been a series of violent border incidents after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India had granted asylum to the Dalai Lama. India initiated a Forward Policy in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the McMahon Line, the eastern portion of a Line of Actual Control proclaimed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1959.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/India_China_Locator.png/250px-India_China_Locator.png
