14.84	Steatorrhea	Steatorrhea	Steatorrhea (or steatorrhoea) is the presence of excess fat in feces. Stools may also float due to excess lipid, have an oily appearance and be especially foul-smelling. An oily anal leakage or some level of fecal incontinence may occur. There is increased fat excretion, which can be measured by determining the fecal fat level. Definitions of how much fecal fat constitutes steatorrhea have not been standardized.
