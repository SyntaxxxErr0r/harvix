54.3	United_States_Statutes_at_Large	United States Statutes at Large	The United States Statutes at Large, commonly referred to as the Statutes at Large and abbreviated Stat., are the official source for the laws and concurrent resolutions passed by the United States Congress. They are also commonly called session laws since they are compiled from slip laws at the end of a Congressional session. They are part of a three-part model for publication of federal statutes consisting of slip laws, session laws, and codification.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/US_Statutes_at_Large.jpg/220px-US_Statutes_at_Large.jpg
