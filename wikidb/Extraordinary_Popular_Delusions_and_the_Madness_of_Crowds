According to Mackay, during this bubble, speculators from all walks of life bought and sold tulip bulbs and even futures contracts on them. Allegedly some tulip bulb varieties briefly became the most expensive objects in the world during 1637. Mackay's accounts are enlivened by colorful, comedic anecdotes, such as the Parisian hunchback who supposedly profited by renting out his hump as a writing desk during the height of the mania surrounding the Mississippi Company.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/South_Sea_Bubble_Cards-Tree.png/220px-South_Sea_Bubble_Cards-Tree.png
