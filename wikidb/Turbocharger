55.4	Turbocharger	Turbocharger	A turbocharger, or turbo (colloquialism), from the Greek "τύρβη" (mixing/spinning) is a forced induction device used to allow more power to be produced for an engine of a given size. Turbos are commonly used on truck, car, trains and construction equipment engines. The key difference between a turbocharger and a supercharger is that the turbocharger is driven by an engine's exhaust gases (a supercharger is mechanically driven from the engine, often from a belt connected to the crankshaft).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Turbocharger.jpg/300px-Turbocharger.jpg
