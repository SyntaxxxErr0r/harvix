65.9	Mica	Mica	The mica group of sheet silicate minerals includes several closely related materials having highly perfect basal cleavage. All are monoclinic, with a tendency towards pseudohexagonal crystals, and are similar in chemical composition. The highly perfect cleavage, which is the most prominent characteristic of mica, is explained by the hexagonal sheet-like arrangement of its atoms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Mica-in-rock-from-alstead.jpg/220px-Mica-in-rock-from-alstead.jpg
