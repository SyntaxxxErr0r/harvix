95.7	Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation	Transcranial magnetic stimulation	Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive method to cause depolarization or hyperpolarization in the neurons of the brain. TMS uses electromagnetic induction to induce weak electric currents using a rapidly changing magnetic field; this can cause activity in specific or general parts of the brain with minimal discomfort, allowing the functioning and interconnections of the brain to be studied. A variant of TMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has been tested as a treatment tool for various neurological and psychiatric disorders including migraines, strokes, Parkinson's disease, dystonia, tinnitus, depression and auditory hallucinations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Repetitive_transcranial_magnetic_stimulation_%28rTMS%29_is_a_technique_for_noninvasive_stimulation_of_the_adult_brain.jpg/230px-Repetitive_transcranial_magnetic_stimulation_%28rTMS%29_is_a_technique_for_noninvasive_stimulation_of_the_adult_brain.jpg
