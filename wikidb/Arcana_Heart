10.41	Arcana_Heart	Arcana Heart	Arcana Heart Arukana HƒÅto) is a 2D arcade fighting game series developed by Examu Inc. (formerly Yuki Enterprise). The first edition was released to arcades (mostly in Japan, but a few in other countries) in late 2006. The games feature an original all-female cast (each a variation of the moe archetype), and after choosing a character, the player chooses an "elemental alignment," or Arcana, which determines the character's special moves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/Arcana_Heart_JP.jpg/256px-Arcana_Heart_JP.jpg
