1.00	Institut_de_Radio_Astronomie_Millimetrique	Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique	The Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique (IRAM) operates two observatories for radio astronomy at millimeter wavelengths, which are open to the international astronomical community: the 30-m single-dish radio telescope located on Pico Veleta (2850 m) in the Spanish Sierra Nevada , and the six-antenna interferometer on the Plateau de Bure (2550 m) in the French Alps. Both sites are at high altitude to reduce the absorption by water vapor. The observatories are supported by the IRAM offices and laboratories in Granada and Grenoble, respectively. IRAM, which is directed by Pierre Cox, has its headquarters in Grenoble.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/IRAM_30m_Sierra_Nevada_-_sky.jpg/250px-IRAM_30m_Sierra_Nevada_-_sky.jpg
