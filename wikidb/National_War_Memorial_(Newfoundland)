It was erected at King's Beach on Water Street where, in 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed Newfoundland for England. It was formally unveiled on Memorial Day, July 1, 1924 by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig. The term "National" refers to this monument being built by the Dominion of Newfoundland as a nation, before it became part of Canada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Nfwarmemorial.jpg/300px-Nfwarmemorial.jpg
