10.36	California_State_Route_91	California State Route 91	State Route 91 (SR 91) is a major eastâ€“west freeway located entirely within Southern California and serving several regions of the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. Specifically, it runs from Vermont Avenue in Gardena, just west of the junction with the Harbor Freeway , east to Riverside at the junction with the Pomona (State Route 60 west of SR 91), and Moreno Valley (SR 60 and I-215 east of SR 91) freeways. The route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and, since the portion west of Vermont Avenue was relinquished to local governments, it is entirely a freeway. SR 91 is part of the State Scenic Highway System from SR 55 to the east city limit of Anaheim, in the western part of the Santa Ana Canyon, and is eligible for the system through the canyon to Interstate 15.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/California_State_Route_91.svg/290px-California_State_Route_91.svg.png
