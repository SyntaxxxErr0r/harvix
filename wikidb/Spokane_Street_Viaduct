1.00	Spokane_Street_Viaduct	West Seattle Bridge	The high-level West Seattle Bridge is a cantilevered segmental bridge that serves as the primary connection between West Seattle and the rest of the city. It was built between 1981 and 1984 after the previous bascule bridge was deemed inoperable as a result of being struck by the Chavez freighter in 1978. The West Seattle Bridge was renamed as the Jeanette Williams Memorial Bridge on July 6, 2009, in honor of Jeanette Williams, who served on the Seattle City Council from 1970 to 1989, and was instrumental in securing political support for the construction of the bridge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/West_Seattle_Bridge_from_12th_Ave_S_Viewpoint_01_-_cropped.jpg/250px-West_Seattle_Bridge_from_12th_Ave_S_Viewpoint_01_-_cropped.jpg
