3.10	Arkona,_Ontario	Arkona, Ontario	The site of the village is at the base of the Wyoming Moraine which formed along the shores of ancient Lake Arkona during the retreat of the Wisconsin Glacier some 16,000 years ago. Rich deposits of fossils are revealed at nearby Hungry Hollow. Evidence of early human habitation exists at the site of Paleo hunting camps which were found just a kilometer south of Arkona dating back some 11,000 years. Subsequent migrations of Archaic and Woodland peoples moved into the area as the climate and vegetation changed. Evidence of this long-standing habitation is frequently discovered in the fields surrounding the current village.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Arkona%2C_Ontario%2C_Canada.jpg/220px-Arkona%2C_Ontario%2C_Canada.jpg
