3.10	Thomas_Cardinal_Cajetan	Thomas Cajetan	Thomas Cajetan , also known as Gaetanus, commonly Tommaso de Vio (20 February 1469 - 9 August 1534), was an Italian cardinal. He is perhaps best known among Protestants for his opposition to the teachings of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation while he was the Pope's Legate in Wittenberg, and perhaps best known among Catholics for his extensive commentary on the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Luther-vor-Cajetan.jpg/220px-Luther-vor-Cajetan.jpg
