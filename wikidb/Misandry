58.8	Misandry	Misandry	Misandry ( ) is the hatred or dislike of men or boys. The word is of some history but did not appear in most dictionaries until the second half of the 20th century, and it was commonly seen as a neologism in the early 1970s. Misandry was formed from Greek misos (μῖσος, "hatred") and anēr, andros (ἀνήρ, gen. ἀνδρός; "man"). Misandry is the antonym of philandry, the fondness, love, or admiration of men.
