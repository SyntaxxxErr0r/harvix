It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbage's difference engine, a design for a mechanical calculator. The Analytical Engine incorporated an arithmetical unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first Turing-complete design for a general-purpose computer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/AnalyticalMachine_Babbage_London.jpg/220px-AnalyticalMachine_Babbage_London.jpg
