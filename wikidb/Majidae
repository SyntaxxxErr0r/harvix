4.10	Majidae	Majidae	Majidae is a family of crabs, comprising around 200 marine species with a carapace that is longer than it is broad, and which forms a point at the front. The legs can be very long in some species, leading to the name "spider crab". The exoskeleton is covered with bristles to which the crab attaches algae and other items to act as camouflage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Sheepcrab_300.jpg/220px-Sheepcrab_300.jpg
