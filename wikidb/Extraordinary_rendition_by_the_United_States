70.2	Extraordinary_rendition_by_the_United_States	Extraordinary rendition	Extraordinary rendition and irregular rendition are terms used to describe the apprehension and extrajudicial transfer of a person from one state to another, and the term "torture by proxy" is used by some critics to describe situations in which the U.S. has purportedly transferred suspected terrorists to countries known to employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture. It has been alleged that torture has been employed with the knowledge or acquiescence of the United States (a transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law), although Condoleezza Rice,(then the United States Secretary of State), stated in an April 2006 radio interview that the United States does not transfer people to places where it is known they will be tortured. Critics have argued that "ghost detainees", "secret prisoners", and references to "detainees in black sites" amount to little more than "enforced disappearances" by the United States under international human rights law.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Premier_Executive_Transport_Services_Boeing_737-700_KvW.jpg/220px-Premier_Executive_Transport_Services_Boeing_737-700_KvW.jpg
