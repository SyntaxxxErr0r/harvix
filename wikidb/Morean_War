2.20	Morean_War	Morean War	The Morean War peninsula in southern Greece. On the Venetian side, the war was fought to avenge the loss of Crete in the Cretan War (1645–1669), while the Ottomans were entangled in their northern frontier against the Habsburgs and were unable to concentrate their forces against the Republic. As such, the Morean War holds the distinction of being the only Ottoman–Venetian conflict from which Venice emerged victorious, gaining significant territory. Venice's expansionist revival would be short-lived however, as their gains were reversed by the Ottomans in 1715.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/South-eastern_Europe_1672.jpg/250px-South-eastern_Europe_1672.jpg
