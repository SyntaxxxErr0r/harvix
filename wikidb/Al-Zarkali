1.00	Al-Zarkali	Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī	, Al-Zarqali, Ibn Zarqala (1029–1087), Latinized as Arzachel, was an instrument maker and one of the leading theoretical and practical astronomers of his time. Although his name is conventionally given as al-Zarqālī, it is probable that the correct form was al-Zarqālluh. He lived in Toledo in Castile, Al-Andalus (now Spain), moving to Córdoba later in his life. His works inspired a generation of Islamic astronomers in Andalusia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Civitas_Toletana%2C_AD_976.jpg/220px-Civitas_Toletana%2C_AD_976.jpg
