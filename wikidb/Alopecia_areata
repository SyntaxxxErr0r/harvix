80.4	Alopecia_areata	Alopecia areata	Alopecia areata is a medical condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body, usually from the scalp. Because it causes bald spots on the scalp, especially in the first stages, it is sometimes called spot baldness. In 1â€“2% of cases, the condition can spread to the entire scalp (Alopecia totalis) or to the entire epidermis (Alopecia universalis). Conditions resembling AA, and having a similar cause, occur also in other species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Allopecia_areata.JPG/230px-Allopecia_areata.JPG
