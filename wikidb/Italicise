1.00	Italicise	Italic type	In typography, italic type is a cursive typeface based on a stylized form of calligraphic handwriting. Owing to the influence from calligraphy, such typefaces often slant slightly to the right. Different glyph shapes from roman type are also usually usedâ€”another influence from calligraphy. True italics are therefore distinct from oblique type, in which the font is merely distorted into a slanted orientation. However, uppercase letters are often oblique type or swash capitals rather than true italics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Niccolo_de_Niccoli_italic_handwriting.jpg/220px-Niccolo_de_Niccoli_italic_handwriting.jpg
