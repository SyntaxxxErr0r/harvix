3.00	Cut_Lunch	Cut Lunch	Cut Lunch is a mini-album or EP by Australian New Wave band Models, originally released on 10" vinyl by Mushroom Records in June 1981. The collection started off as demo recordings, which proved successful enough to release just before the group went to England to record their second album proper, Local and/or General. One track, "Man o' Action", was re-recorded for that album. Cut Lunch is generally regarded as the Models' release which is the most influenced by post-punk and dub, and least by conventional pop music. Apart from "Atlantic Romantic", which had been a live favourite of the group for a number of years, the songs were freshly composed: their lyrics were difficult to understand, and remain confusing even now. "Atlantic Romantic" was co-produced by Eddie Rayner of Split Enz fame.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/CutLunch3.jpg/220px-CutLunch3.jpg
