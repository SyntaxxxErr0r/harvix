1.00	COBISS	COBISS	COBISS (abbreviation for Co-operative Online Bibliographic System &amp; Services) is an organisational model used to join libraries in a uniform library information system with shared cataloguing. It has many functions of the so-called virtual library. It is currently in use in Slovenia (COBISS.SI), Bosnia and Herzegovina (COBISS.BH), Republic of Macedonia (COBISS.MK), Serbia (COBISS.SR) and Montenegro (COBISS.CG). These information systems are autonomous, but share the platform. Over 350 libraries use COBISS software for the automation of their operations. COBISS.Net is the name of the network connecting the COBISS co-operative bibliographic systems of different countries.
