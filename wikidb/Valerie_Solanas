65.9	Valerie_Solanas	Valerie Solanas	Valerie Jean Solanas (April 9, 1936 â€“ April 25, 1988) was an American radical feminist writer, best known for her attempted murder of Andy Warhol in 1968. She wrote the SCUM Manifesto, which urged women to "overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex." Some authors regard the manifesto as a parody of patriarchy and a satirical work.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/36/Valerie_Solanas.jpg
