They have competed in the Hong Kong Sevens since the 1980s. In 1989, veteran rugby commentator Bill McLaren mentions them in an article on the Hong Kong Sevens, saying that their team had players such as Kothalawala, Ekanayake and Lakshantha, and that he was grateful that he did not have to broadcast all the names, as he had trouble pronouncing them correctly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/SLRFU_Logo.png
