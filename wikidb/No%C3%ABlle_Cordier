2.00	No%C3%ABlle_Cordier	Noëlle Cordier	Noëlle Cordier (born 7 April 1944 in Paris) is a French singer. She participated for France in the 1967 Eurovision Song Contest in Vienna with the song "Il doit faire beau là-bas", finishing in third place of 17 entries (behind the runaway winner Sandie Shaw for the United Kingdom, and Ireland's Sean Dunphy). The song is very well thought-of and remains a favourite with Eurovision fans. Cordier attempted a return to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1970 with the song "Comme en pourrait s'aimer" but it was not selected to represent France.
