4.00	Bistecca_alla_fiorentina	T-bone steak	The T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin and including a T-shaped bone with meat on each side: the larger is a strip steak and the smaller a tenderloin steak. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and include more tenderloin, while T-bone steaks are cut from farther forward and contain less.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/BeefCutShortLoinTenderloin.svg/300px-BeefCutShortLoinTenderloin.svg.png
