79.1	HTML5_video	HTML5 video	HTML5 video is an element introduced in the HTML5 draft specification for the purpose of playing videos or movies, partially replacing the object element. HTML5 video is intended by its creators to become the new standard way to show video on the web without plugins, but has been hampered by lack of agreement as to which video formats should be supported in web browsers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Media_availablity_in_web_browsers.svg/220px-Media_availablity_in_web_browsers.svg.png
