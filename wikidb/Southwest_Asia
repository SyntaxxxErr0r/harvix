57.4	Southwest_Asia	Western Asia	Western Asia, West Asia, Southwest Asia or Southwestern Asia are terms that describe the westernmost portion of Asia. The terms are partly coterminous with the Middle East, which describes a geographical position in relation to Western Europe rather than its location within Asia. Due to this perceived Eurocentrism, international organizations such as the United Nations, have replaced Middle East and Near East with Western Asia. This region and Europe are collectively referred to as Western Eurasia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Western_Asia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/200px-Western_Asia_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png
