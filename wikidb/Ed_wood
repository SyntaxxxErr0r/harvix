26.64	Ed_wood	Ed Wood	Edward Davis "Ed" Wood, Jr. (October 10, 1924 â€“ December 10, 1978) was an American screenwriter, director, producer, actor, author, and editor, who often performed many of these functions simultaneously. In the 1950s, Wood made a number of low-budget genre films, now notable for their technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, large amounts of ill-fitting stock footage, idiosyncratic dialogue, eccentric casts and outlandish plot elements, although his flair for showmanship gave his projects at least a modicum of critical success.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Edwood1.jpg/220px-Edwood1.jpg
