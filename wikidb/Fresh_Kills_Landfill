51.6	Fresh_Kills_Landfill	Fresh Kills Landfill	The Fresh Kills Landfill was a landfill covering 2,200 acres (890 ha) in the New York City borough of Staten Island in the United States. The name comes from the landfill's location along the banks of the Fresh Kills estuary in western Staten Island. The landfill was opened in 1947 as a temporary landfill, but eventually became New York City's principal landfill in the second half of the 20th century, and it was once the largest landfill, as well as man-made structure, in the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Wpdms_usgs_photo_fresh_kills.jpg/250px-Wpdms_usgs_photo_fresh_kills.jpg
