78.4	B_vitamins	B vitamins	B vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism. The B vitamins were once thought to be a single vitamin, referred to as vitamin B (much as people refer to vitamin C or vitamin D). Later research showed that they are chemically distinct vitamins that often coexist in the same foods. In general, supplements containing all eight are referred to as a vitamin B complex. Individual B vitamin supplements are referred to by the specific name of each vitamin (e.g., B1, B2, B3 etc.).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/B_vitamin_supplement_tablets.jpg/220px-B_vitamin_supplement_tablets.jpg
