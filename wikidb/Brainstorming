115.2	Brainstorming	Brainstorming	Brainstorming is a group or individual creativity technique by which efforts are made to find a conclusion for a specific problem by gathering a list of ideas spontaneously contributed by its member(s). The term was popularized by Alex Faickney Osborn in the 1953 book Applied Imagination. Osborn claimed that brainstorming was more effective than individuals working alone in generating ideas, although more recent research has questioned this conclusion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/2007-07-13-brainstorming.gif/240px-2007-07-13-brainstorming.gif
