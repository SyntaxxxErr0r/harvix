70.1	Defragmentation	Defragmentation	In the maintenance of file systems, defragmentation is a process that reduces the amount of fragmentation. It does this by physically organizing the contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest number of contiguous regions (fragments). It also attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction to impede the return of fragmentation. Some defragmentation utilities try to keep smaller files within a single directory together, as they are often accessed in sequence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/FragmentationDefragmentation.gif/220px-FragmentationDefragmentation.gif
