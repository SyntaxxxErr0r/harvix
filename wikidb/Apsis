54.1	Apsis	Apsis	An apsis (Greek ἁψίς, gen. ἁψίδος), plural apsides (Greek: ἁψίδες), is the point of greatest or least distance of a body from one of the foci of its elliptical orbit. In modern celestial mechanics this focus is also the center of attraction, which is usually the center of mass of the system. Historically, in geocentric systems, apsides were measured from the center of the Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Apogee_%28PSF%29.png/250px-Apogee_%28PSF%29.png
