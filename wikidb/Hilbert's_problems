51.7	Hilbert's_problems	Hilbert's problems	Hilbert originally included 24 problems on his list, but decided against including one of them in the published list. The "24th problem" (in proof theory, on a criterion for simplicity and general methods) was rediscovered in Hilbert's original manuscript notes by German historian RÃ¼diger Thiele in 2000.
