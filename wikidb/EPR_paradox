61.9	EPR_paradox	EPR paradox	The EPR paradox is an early and influential critique leveled against quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein and his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (known collectively as EPR) designed a thought experiment intended to reveal what they believed to be inadequacies of quantum mechanics. To that end they pointed to a consequence of quantum mechanics that its supporters had not noticed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/EPR-paradox-illus.png/500px-EPR-paradox-illus.png
