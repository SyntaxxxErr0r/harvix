2.00	%CE%91-Parinaric_acid	alpha-Parinaric acid	α-Parinaric acid is a conjugated polyunsaturated fatty acid. Discovered by Tsujimoto and Koyanagi in 1933, it contains 18 carbon atoms and 4 conjugated double bonds. The repeating single bond-double bond structure of α-parinaric acid distinguishes it structurally and chemically from the usual "methylene-interrupted" arrangement of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have double-bonds and single bonds separated by a methylene unit (CH2). Because of the fluorescent properties conferred by the alternating double bonds, α-parinaric acid is commonly used as a molecular probe in the study of biomembranes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Alpha-Parinaric_acid.png/300px-Alpha-Parinaric_acid.png
