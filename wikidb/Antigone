35.53	Antigone	Antigone	In Greek mythology, Antigone ( -gə-nee; ) is the daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta, Oedipus' mother. The name may be taken to mean "unbending", coming from "anti-" (against, opposed to) and "-gon / -gony" (corner, bend, angle; ex: polygon), but has also been suggested to mean "opposed to motherhood", "in place of a mother", or "anti-generative", based from the root gonē, "that which generates" (related: gonos, "-gony"; seed, semen).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Antigoneleigh.jpg/200px-Antigoneleigh.jpg
