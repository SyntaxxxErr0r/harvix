51.6	What_would_Jesus_do%3F	What would Jesus do?	The phrase "What would Jesus do?" (often abbreviated to WWJD) became popular in the United States in the 1990s and as a personal motto for adherents of Evangelical Christianity who used the phrase as a reminder of their belief in a moral imperative to act in a manner that would demonstrate the love of Jesus through the actions of the adherents. A follow-up motto answered the question "Fully Rely On God" (often abbreviated to "FROG").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/WWJD-bracelet.jpg/200px-WWJD-bracelet.jpg
