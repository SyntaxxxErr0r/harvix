108.5	Darfur	Darfur	Darfur (Arabic: â€Ž , English: ) is a region in western Sudan. An independent sultanate for several hundred years, it was incorporated into Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1916. The region is divided into five federal states: Central Darfur, East Darfur, North Darfur, South Darfur and West Darfur. Because of the war in Darfur between Sudanese government forces and the non-Arab indigenous population, the region has been in a state of humanitarian emergency from 2003 to 2009/2010.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Map_of_Darfur_2011.png/250px-Map_of_Darfur_2011.png
