54.6	PDIF	S/PDIF	S/PDIF is a digital audio interconnect used in consumer audio equipment over relatively short distances. The signal is transmitted over either a coaxial cable with RCA connectors or a fibre optic cable with TOSLINK connectors. S/PDIF interconnects components in home theatres and other digital high fidelity systems. S/PDIF is based on the professional AES3 interconnect standard. S/PDIF can carry two channels of PCM audio or a multi-channel compressed surround sound format such as Dolby Digital or DTS.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Connector-high-quality-BNC-to-RCA.jpg/220px-Connector-high-quality-BNC-to-RCA.jpg
