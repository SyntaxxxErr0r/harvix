The war was preceded by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday, 15 February 2011, which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the crowd. The protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country, with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body, the National Transitional Council.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Libyancivilwar2.png/300px-Libyancivilwar2.png
