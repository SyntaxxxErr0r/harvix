1.00	Peruvian_presidential_line_of_succession	List of Presidents of Peru	Established in the Constitution of 1993, the President of Peru, officially the President of the Republic , is the head of state of Peru and represents the republic in official international matters. The presidential term is five years. Also, Peru allows an incumbent President to succeed himself only once. Therefore, after a re-election (ten years in power) an incumbent president is barred from running in the election. (A former president may run again in subsequent presidential elections if he hasn't been in power twice). The current president of Peru is Ollanta Humala, elected in 2011.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Flag_of_Peru_%28state%29.svg/150px-Flag_of_Peru_%28state%29.svg.png
