1.00	Podaxis_pistillaris	Podaxis pistillaris	Podaxis pistillaris is a very distinctive relative of the puffballs. It grows to 15 cm high and has a hard, woody stem. The large cap, which protects the blackish spore-bearing tissue, splits, and usually falls away at maturity, allowing the spores to be dispersed by wind. Large numbers may appear after soaking rains. It thrives in deserts and semi-deserts of Australia and other countries. In the Hawaiian Islands, it is frequently encountered along roadsides and in disturbed areas on the dry sides of the islands, especially in the Kona area of Hawaii and the Kihei area of Maui.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Mushroom_in_Wadi_Rum_01.jpg/200px-Mushroom_in_Wadi_Rum_01.jpg
