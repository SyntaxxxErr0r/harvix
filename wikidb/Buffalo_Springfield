61.5	Buffalo_Springfield	Buffalo Springfield	Buffalo Springfield is a North American folk rock band renowned both for its music and as a springboard for the careers of Neil Young, Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and Jim Messina. Among the first wave of North American bands to become popular in the wake of the British invasion, the group combined rock, folk, and country music into a sound all its own. Its million-selling song "For What It's Worth" became a political anthem for the turbulent late 1960s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f7/Buffalo_springfield_2.jpg/220px-Buffalo_springfield_2.jpg
