2.10	Heimlich_Maneuver	Choking	Choking is the mechanical obstruction of the flow of air from the environment into the lungs. Choking prevents breathing, and can be partial or complete, with partial choking allowing some, although inadequate, flow of air into the lungs. Prolonged or complete choking results in asphyxia which leads to anoxia and is potentially fatal. Oxygen stored in the blood and lungs keep the victim alive for several minutes after breathing is stopped completely.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Abdominal_thrusts3.jpg
