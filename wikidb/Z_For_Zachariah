7.31	Z_For_Zachariah	Z for Zachariah	Z for Zachariah is a novel by Robert C. O'Brien which was published posthumously in 1973. He died when writing the last chapter, so his family finished the book for him. It is written from the first person perspective of a sixteen-year-old girl named Ann Burden, who survives a nuclear war in a small American town. The town's location is in a geographically distinct and remote valley that shelters it from the nuclear fallout. The book takes the form of a diary kept by Ann as she recounts the events that followed the war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/ZforZachariah.png/220px-ZforZachariah.png
