138.7	Experiment	Experiment	An experiment is a methodical trial and error procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. Experiments vary greatly in their goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. A child may carry out basic experiments to understand the nature of gravity, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance the understanding of a phenomenon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Mirror_baby.jpg/160px-Mirror_baby.jpg
