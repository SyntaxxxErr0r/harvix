The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Mall as part of the National Mall and Memorial Parks unit. The term National Mall commonly includes areas that are officially part of West Potomac Park and Constitution Gardens to the west, and often is taken to refer to the entire area between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, with the Washington Monument providing a division slightly west of the center. The National Mall receives approximately 24 million visitors each year.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/National_Mall%2C_DC.jpg/250px-National_Mall%2C_DC.jpg
