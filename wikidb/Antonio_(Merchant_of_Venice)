10.20	Antonio_(Merchant_of_Venice)	Antonio (Merchant of Venice)	Antonio is the title character in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice. He is a middle-aged bachelor and merchant by trade who has his financial interests tied up in overseas shipments when the play begins. He is kind, generous, honest and confident, and is loved and revered by all the Christians who know him. Even Portia, who sees Antonio as a rival for her husband’s affections, reveres his character and appreciates — with reservations — his willingness to die for Bassanio. Antonio manifests his piety by cursing and spitting at Shylock (anti-semitism was common in Europe in Shakespeare's day).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Shylock_icon.png/100px-Shylock_icon.png
