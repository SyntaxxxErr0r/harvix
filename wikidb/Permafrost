73.4	Permafrost	Permafrost	In geology, permafrost or cryotic soil is soil at or below the freezing point of water for two or more years. Ice is not always present, as may be in the case of nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and it may be in amounts exceeding the potential hydraulic saturation of the ground material. Most permafrost is located in high latitudes (i.e. land close to the North and South poles), but alpine permafrost may exist at high altitudes in much lower latitudes. Permafrost accounts for 0.022% of total water and exists in 24% of exposed land in the Northern Hemisphere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Circum-Arctic_Map_of_Permafrost_and_Ground_Ice_Conditions.png/250px-Circum-Arctic_Map_of_Permafrost_and_Ground_Ice_Conditions.png
