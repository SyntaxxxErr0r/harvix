Beginning on July 23, 1983, there was an on-and-off insurgency against the government by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (the LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers), a separatist militant organization which fought to create an independent Tamil state named Tamil Eelam in the north and the east of the island. After a 26 year long military campaign, the Sri Lankan military defeated the Tamil Tigers in May 2009.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Sri_Lanka-CIA_WFB_Map.png/250px-Sri_Lanka-CIA_WFB_Map.png
