109.4	Superconducting_Super_Collider	Superconducting Super Collider	The Superconducting Super Collider (also nicknamed the Desertron) was a particle accelerator complex under construction in the vicinity of Waxahachie, Texas that was set to be world's largest and most energetic, surpassing the current record held by the Large Hadron Collider. Its planned ring circumference was 87.1 kilometres (54.1 mi) with an energy of 20 TeV per proton. The project's director was Roy Schwitters, a physicist at the University of Texas at Austin and Harvard University. Dr. Louis Ianniello served as Associate Director. The project was cancelled in 1993 due to budget problems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Ssc_mdl.JPG/300px-Ssc_mdl.JPG
