4.10	A272_road	A272 road	The A272 is a road in South-East England. It follows an approximate East-West route from near Heathfield, East Sussex to the city of Winchester, Hampshire. It has achieved somewhat unlikely fame in recent years by being the subject of a book by the Dutch author, Pieter Boogaart. It was also mentioned by Michael Palin in an early Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch about Pablo Picasso painting whilst riding a bicycle: "Well this is a truly remarkable occasion as it's the first time that a modern artist of such stature... has taken the A272."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/UK_road_A272.PNG/175px-UK_road_A272.PNG
