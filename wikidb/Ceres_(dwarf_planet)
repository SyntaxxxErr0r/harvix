85.1	Ceres_(dwarf_planet)	Ceres (dwarf planet)	Ceres, formally 1 Ceres, is the smallest identified dwarf planet in the Solar System and the only one in the asteroid belt. It is a rock–ice body some 950 km (590 mi) in diameter, comprising about a third of the mass of the asteroid belt, and by far the largest and most-massive asteroid. Discovered on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, it was the first asteroid to be identified, though it was considered a planet at the time. It is named after Cerēs, the Roman goddess of growing plants, the harvest, and motherly love.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Ceres_optimized.jpg/250px-Ceres_optimized.jpg
