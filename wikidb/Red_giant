52.2	Red_giant	Red giant	A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass (roughly 0.5â€“10 solar masses) in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius immense and the surface temperature low, somewhere from 5,000 K and lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow orange to red, including the spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/HR-diag-no-text-2.svg/400px-HR-diag-no-text-2.svg.png
