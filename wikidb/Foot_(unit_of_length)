55.2	Foot_(unit_of_length)	Foot (unit)	A foot (plural: feet; abbreviation or symbol: ft or â€² (the prime symbol)) is a unit of length in a number of different systems including Ancient Greek, Ancient Roman, English units, Imperial units, United States customary units and the units of many Continental European countries. Its size varied from system to system, but in each is around a quarter to a third of a meter and most but not all were subdivided into 12 inches. The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that does not mainly use the metric system in its commercial and standards activities, and uses the international foot (a customary unit of length) and the survey foot. The foot is still officially used in Canada and still commonly used in the United Kingdom, which has partially metricated in some walks of life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Fu%C3%9Fma%C3%9Fe1.jpg/250px-Fu%C3%9Fma%C3%9Fe1.jpg
