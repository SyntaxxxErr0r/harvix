56.0	Visual_basic	Visual Basic	Visual Basic is a third-generation event-driven programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft for its COM programming model first released in 1991. Visual Basic is designed to be relatively easy to learn and use. Visual Basic was derived from BASIC and enables the rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user interface (GUI) applications, access to databases using Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects, or ActiveX Data Objects, and creation of ActiveX controls and objects. Scripting languages such as VBA and VBScript are syntactically similar to Visual Basic, but perform differently.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/75/Microsoft_Visual_Studio_6_screenshot.png/250px-Microsoft_Visual_Studio_6_screenshot.png
