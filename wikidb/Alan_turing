102.7	Alan_turing	Alan Turing	Alan Mathison Turing, OBE, FRS ( -ing; 23 June 1912 â€“ 7 June 1954), was an English mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of "algorithm" and "computation" with the Turing machine, which played a significant role in the creation of the modern computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. He was stockily built, had a high-pitched voice, and was talkative, witty, and somewhat donnish. He showed many of the characteristics that are indicative of Asperger syndrome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Alan_Turing_photo.jpg/200px-Alan_Turing_photo.jpg
