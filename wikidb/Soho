81.5	Soho	Soho	Soho is an area of the City of Westminster and part of the West End of London. Long established as an entertainment district, for much of the 20th century Soho had a reputation for sex shops as well as night life and film industry. Since the early 1980s, the area has undergone considerable transformation. It now is predominantly a fashionable district of upmarket restaurants and media offices, with only a small remnant of sex industry venues.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Soho_palace_theatre_1.jpg/240px-Soho_palace_theatre_1.jpg
