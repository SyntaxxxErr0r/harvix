6.10	Walking_in_the_United_Kingdom	Walking in the United Kingdom	In England and Wales the public has a legally protected right to "pass and repass" (i.e. walk) on footpaths, bridleways and other routes which have the status of a public right of way. Footpaths typically pass over private land, but if they are public rights of way they are public highways with the same protection in law as other highways, such as trunk roads. Public rights of way originated in common law, but are now regulated by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. These rights have occasionally resulted in conflicts between walkers and landowners. The rights and obligations of farmers who cultivate crops in fields crossed by public footpaths are now specified in the law. Walkers can also use permissive paths, where the public does not have a legal right to walk, but where the landowner has granted permission for them to walk.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Ivinghoe_Beacon_seen_from_The_Ridgeway.jpg/220px-Ivinghoe_Beacon_seen_from_The_Ridgeway.jpg
