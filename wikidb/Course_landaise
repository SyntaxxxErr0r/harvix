7.00	Course_landaise	Course landaise	The course Landaise is an ancient form of bullfighting held in oval or rectangular arenas covered in sand, that does not involve any bloodshed. Experienced cows generally from the age of 2 and up to 14 years old are used instead of bulls. They are athletic animals selected from the same breed as the bulls used for the Spanish Corridas. The course Landaise is in Gascony a major spectator sport, counting as many as 600 events each year. It is one of the various forms of entertainment involving a bull or a cow found throughout the south of France, and the Iberian peninsula. The course Landaise is for the most part the main attraction of the yearly celebrations held in villages of western Gascony (Bas-Armagnac, Chalosse, and Bearn) and as far west as Bayonne. Other forms of related entertainments are the running of the bulls made famous in the neighboring Spanish Basque Country by the Ferias of Pamplona, but also enjoyed in Bayonne and smaller towns of Gascony such as Nogaro. The Course Landaise can in a way be compared with the steer-wrestling "games" in American rodeos to the extent that they are related expressions of a rural culture that can be traced to the ancient Iberic world.
