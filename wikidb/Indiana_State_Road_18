State Route 18 is mainly a 2 lane road with exception of 4 lane divided highway from Marion to Interstate 69 (I-69). Marion is the only considerably large city that Route 18 passes through. State Route 18 runs just south of the lakes region, with Lake Shafer, Lake Freeman, Mississinewa Reservoir, and Salamonie Reservoir not too far to the north. Along State Route 18, you will see small farming towns and lots of flat ground.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Map_of_Indiana_State_Road_18.svg/290px-Map_of_Indiana_State_Road_18.svg.png
