146.2	Unobtrusive_JavaScript	Unobtrusive JavaScript	Adherents to "Unobtrusive Javascript" argue that the purpose of markup is to describe a document's structure, not its programmatic behavior and that combining the two negatively impacts a site's maintainability for similar reasons that combining content and presentation does. They also argue that inline event handlers are harder to use and maintain, when one needs to set handlers for several events on a single element, when one wants to set the same event handler on several elements, or when one is using event delegation. Nor can they be used with custom events.
