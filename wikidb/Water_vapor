73.7	Water_vapor	Water vapor	Water vapor or water vapour (see spelling differences), also aqueous vapor, is the gas phase of water. It is one state of water within the hydrosphere. Water vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice. Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation. It is lighter than air and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/St_Johns_Fog.jpg/250px-St_Johns_Fog.jpg
