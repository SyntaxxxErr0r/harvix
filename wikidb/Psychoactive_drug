60.5	Psychoactive_drug	Psychoactive drug	A psychoactive drug, psychopharmaceutical, or psychotropic is a chemical substance that crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier and acts primarily upon the central nervous system where it affects brain function, resulting in changes in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, and behavior. These substances may be used recreationally, to purposefully alter one's consciousness, as entheogens, for ritual, spiritual, and/or shamanic purposes, as a tool for studying or augmenting the mind, or therapeutically as medication.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Pyschoactive_Drugs.jpg/250px-Pyschoactive_Drugs.jpg
