4.00	Shadrach,_Meshack,_and_Abednego	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are people recorded in the biblical Hebrew book of Daniel Chapters 1â€“3, known for their exclusive devotion to God. In particular, they are known for being saved by divine intervention from the Babylonian execution of being burned alive in a fiery furnace. They were three young Jews, of royal or noble birth from the Kingdom of Judah, who, along with Daniel, were inducted into Babylon when Jerusalem was occupied by the Babylonians in 606/605 BCE, under the campaign of Nebuchadnezzar II, during the first deportation of the Israelites.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Simeon_Solomon_-_Shadrach_Meshach_Abednego.JPG/240px-Simeon_Solomon_-_Shadrach_Meshach_Abednego.JPG
