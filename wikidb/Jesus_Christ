81.2	Jesus_Christ	Jesus	Jesus of Nazareth (7–2 BC/BCE to 30–36 AD/CE), also referred to as Jesus Christ or simply Christ, is the central figure of Christianity and is also regarded as an important prophet of God in Islam. Most Christian denominations venerate him as God the Son incarnated and believe that he rose from the dead after being crucified. The principal sources of information regarding Jesus are the Bible's four canonical gospels, which most biblical scholars find useful for reconstructing Jesus' life and teachings. Scholars have correlated the New Testament accounts with non-Christian historical records to arrive at an estimated chronology for the major episodes in the life of Jesus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/StJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd-frame_crop.jpg/220px-StJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd-frame_crop.jpg
