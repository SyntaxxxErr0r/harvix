1.20	Double_rifle	Double rifle	A double-barreled rifle or double rifle is a type of sporting rifle with two barrels instead of one, available in either side-by-side or over-and-under barrel configurations. Double rifles are one of the family of combination guns. In general, double rifles are much more expensive than the more common magazine-repeater rifles, and, owing to the large-calibre cartridges commonly used, have to withstand very high levels of recoil. Because of their ability to fire two quick shots, double rifles are often used for the hunting of dangerous game in Africa. While today double rifles are typically associated with African big game hunting, they saw their most extensive use during the colonial period in India.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/DoubleRifleProfile.jpg/220px-DoubleRifleProfile.jpg
