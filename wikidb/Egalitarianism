58.6	Egalitarianism	Egalitarianism	The Christian egalitarian view holds that the Bible teaches the fundamental equality of women and men of all racial and ethnic mixes, all economic classes, and all age groups, based on the teachings and example of Jesus Christ and the overarching principles of scripture. However, within the wide range of Christianity, there are dissenting views from opposing groups, some of which are Complementarians and Patriarchalists. At its foundational level, Christian thought holds that "... in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, man nor woman", defining all as equal in the sight of God. Various Christian groups have attempted to hold to this view and develop Christian oriented communities. The most notable of these are the Amish and Hutterite groups of Europe and North America, living in agricultural and collective communities.
