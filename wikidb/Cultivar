70.7	Cultivar	Cultivar	A cultivarnb 1 is a plant or group of plants selected for desirable characteristics that can be maintained by propagation. Most cultivars have arisen in cultivation but a few are special selections from the wild. Popular ornamental garden plants like roses, camellias, daffodils, rhododendrons, and azaleas are cultivars produced by careful breeding and selection for flower colour and form. Similarly the world's agricultural food crops are almost exclusively cultivars that have been selected for characteristics like improved yield, flavour, and resistance to disease: Very few wild plants are now used as food sources. Trees used in forestry are also special selections grown for their enhanced quality and yield of timber.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Daisy1web.jpg/400px-Daisy1web.jpg
