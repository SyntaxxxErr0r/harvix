170.4	Lawyer	Lawyer	A lawyer, according to Black's Law Dictionary, is "a person learned in the law; as an attorney, counsel or solicitor; a person who is practicing law." Law is the system of rules of conduct established by the sovereign government of a society to correct wrongs, maintain the stability of political and social authority, and deliver justice. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who retain (i.e., hire) lawyers to perform legal services.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Honor%C3%A9_Daumier_018.jpg/230px-Honor%C3%A9_Daumier_018.jpg
