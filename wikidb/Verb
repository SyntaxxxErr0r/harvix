69.4	Verb	Verb	A verb, from the Latin verbum meaning word, is a word that in syntax conveys an action (bring, read, walk, run, learn), an occurrence (happen, become), or a state of being (be, exist, stand). In the usual description of English, the basic form, with or without the particle to, is the infinitive. In many languages, verbs are inflected (modified in form) to encode tense, aspect, mood and voice. A verb may also agree with the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments, such as its subject, or object.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Conjugaci%C3%B3n_de_correr.png/220px-Conjugaci%C3%B3n_de_correr.png
