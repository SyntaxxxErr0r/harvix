2.10	Fianna_Eireann	Fianna Éireann	Fianna Éireann, organised as a youth hurling league for boys and girls, existed in West Belfast, ca. 1903 (see Witness Statement of Bulmer Hobson to the Bureau of Military History, 1948). This was the brainchild of Bulmer Hobson (see Hobson's Statement to BMH), a committed IRB member. (Hobson's statemnt) Hobson relocated to Dublin and the organisation collapsed in Belfast. In Dublin, Hobson became acquainted with Constance Markievicz, Helena Moloney and others, who were all members of the newly founded Sinn Féin. They were members of the Drumcondra branch. Hobson told Markievicz of his Belfast experiment and the seed was sown with her. With Helena Moloney and Seán McGarry, Markievicz and Hobson soon recreated a new Fianna Éireann. Prior to the setting up of Na Fianna in Dublin in 1909, it has now transpired that Lord Baden Powell had reportedly unsuccessfully sought the assistance of Patrick Pearse in setting up a branch of his Boy Scouts in Dublin.
