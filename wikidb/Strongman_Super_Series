4.40	Strongman_Super_Series	Strongman Super Series	The Strongman Super Series, known from 2005 to 2008 as the World's Strongest Man Super Series and reverting in 2009 to the World Strongman Super Series, is a sequence of grand prix events in the sport of strength athletics. It was introduced in 2001 in response to concerns that, unlike other individual sports such as golf or tennis, there was no recognized international "tour" in strength athletics. The Strongman Super Series ensures that there are a number of high-profile, professionally run contests during the year, with competitors' placings being used to decide the overall Super Series Champion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/StrongmanSuperSeries09Logo.jpg/150px-StrongmanSuperSeries09Logo.jpg
