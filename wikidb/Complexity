103.8	Complexity	Complexity	In general usage, complexity tends to be used to characterize something with many parts in intricate arrangement. The study of these complex linkages is the main goal of complex systems theory. In science there are at this time a number of approaches to characterizing complexity, many of which are reflected in this article. In a business context, complexity management is the methodology to minimize value-destroying complexity and efficiently control value-adding complexity in a cross-functional approach.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Complexity-map_Castellani.jpg/800px-Complexity-map_Castellani.jpg
