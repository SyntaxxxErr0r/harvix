102.5	Cosmological_constant	Cosmological constant	In physical cosmology, the cosmological constant (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter lambda: Î›) was proposed by Albert Einstein as a modification of his original theory of general relativity to achieve a stationary universe. Einstein abandoned the concept after the observation of the Hubble redshift indicated that the universe might not be stationary, as he had based his theory on the idea that the universe is unchanging. However, the discovery of cosmic acceleration in 1998 has renewed interest in a cosmological constant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/WMAP_2010.png/220px-WMAP_2010.png
