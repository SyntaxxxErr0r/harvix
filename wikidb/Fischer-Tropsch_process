54.9	Fischer-Tropsch_process	Fischer–Tropsch process	The F–T process has been applied on a large scale in some industrial sectors, although its popularity is hampered by high capital costs, high operation and maintenance costs, the uncertain and volatile price of crude oil, and environmental concerns. In particular, the use of natural gas as a feedstock becomes practical only with use of "stranded gas", i.e. sources of natural gas far from major cities which are impractical to exploit with conventional gas pipelines and LNG technology; otherwise, the direct sale of natural gas to consumers would become much more profitable. Several companies are developing the process to enable practical exploitation of so-called stranded gas reserves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Holzvergasung.jpg/220px-Holzvergasung.jpg
