6.14	Boss_(video_game)	Boss (video gaming)	A boss is an enemy-based challenge (and a computer-controlled opponent in such a challenge) which is found in video games. A fight with a boss character is commonly referred to as a boss battle or boss fight. Boss battles are generally seen at the climax of a particular section of the game, usually at the end of a stage or level, or guarding a specific objective, and the boss enemy is generally far stronger than the opponents the player has faced up to that point.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Supertux_boss.png/220px-Supertux_boss.png
