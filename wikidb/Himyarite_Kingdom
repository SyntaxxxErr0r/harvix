12.00	Himyarite_Kingdom	Himyarite Kingdom	The Himyarite Kingdom or Himyar (in Arabic مملكة حِمْيَر mamlakat ħimyâr) (r. 110 BC–520s), historically referred to as the Homerite Kingdom by the Greeks and the Romans, was a kingdom in ancient Yemen. Established in 110 BC, it took as its capital the modern day city of Sana'a after the ancient city of Zafar. The Kingdom conquered neighbouring Saba (Sheba) in c.25 BC, Qataban in c.200 CE, and Hadramaut c.300 CE. Its political fortunes relative to Saba changed frequently until it finally conquered the Sabaean Kingdom around 280 CE.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Map_of_Aksum_and_South_Arabia_ca._230_AD.jpg/250px-Map_of_Aksum_and_South_Arabia_ca._230_AD.jpg
