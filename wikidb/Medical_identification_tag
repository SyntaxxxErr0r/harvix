6.31	Medical_identification_tag	Medical identification tag	A medical identification tag is a small emblem or tag worn on a bracelet, neck chain, or on the clothing bearing a message that the wearer has an important medical condition that might require immediate attention. The intention is to alert a paramedic, physician, emergency department personnel or other first responders of the condition even if the wearer is not conscious enough or old enough to explain. Some people prefer to carry a wallet card with the same information.
