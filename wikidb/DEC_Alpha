77.0	DEC_Alpha	DEC Alpha	Alpha, originally known as Alpha AXP, is a 64-bit reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), designed to replace the 32-bit VAX complex instruction set computer (CISC) ISA and its implementations. Alpha was implemented in microprocessors originally developed and fabricated by DEC. These microprocessors were most prominently used in a variety of DEC workstations and servers, which eventually formed the basis for almost all of their mid-to-upper-scale lineup. Several third-party vendors also produced Alpha systems, including PC form factor motherboards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Alpha_AXP_21064_diephoto1.jpg/220px-Alpha_AXP_21064_diephoto1.jpg
