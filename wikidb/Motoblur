34.74	Motoblur	Motoblur	Motoblur (often stylized as MOTOBLUR) is an Android UI replacement and push-based service focused on social networking, developed by Motorola. It aims at functional similarity to Palm's Synergy, including such features as Remote Wipe. Motoblur includes a variety of widgets which combine various social networking portals such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter as well as other services (news or weather reports) all in one place. Feeds and data are regularly pushed to these widgets. Motoblur is currently on Electrify/Photon 4G, Atrix 4G, CLIQ/DEXT, Backflip, Devour, Flipout, Charm, Spice, Droid Pro, Filpside, DEFY, Bravo, Droid X, Droid 3, Droid 2, Droid Bionic, and Droid Razr. The version found on the Droid X, Droid Pro, Droid 2, Droid Bionic, Droid 3, Electrify/Photon 4G, and DEFY is intended to be less intrusive than previous versions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Android_robot.svg/100px-Android_robot.svg.png
