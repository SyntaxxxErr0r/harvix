1.10	West_Rock_Ridge_State_Park	West Rock Ridge State Park	West Rock Ridge State Park is a state park located in New Haven, Hamden, and Woodbridge, Connecticut. It is named for the 400-to-700-foot (120 to 210 m) trap rock West Rock Ridge, which is part of the Metacomet Ridge extending from Long Island Sound to the Vermont border. The ridge consists largely of diabase, much like its sister formation East Rock. The park offers recreational trails, car-top boating, and 7 miles (11 km) of open west-facing cliffs with vistas encompassing Metropolitan New Haven and suburban towns to the west. The park includes Judges Cave, a colonial era historic site; Lake Wintergreen; and the 7-mile (11 km) Regicides Trail, part of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association's Blue Trail system. West Rock Ridge State Park is part of a larger area of protected open space including state, municipal, and non-profit owned land.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/N58102886_30611581_9191.jpeg/220px-N58102886_30611581_9191.jpeg
