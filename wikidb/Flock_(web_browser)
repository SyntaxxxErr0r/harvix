55.1	Flock_(web_browser)	Flock (web browser)	Flock was a web browser that specialized in providing social networking and Web 2.0 facilities built into its user interface. Earlier versions of Flock used the Gecko HTML rendering engine by Mozilla. Version 2.6.2, released in July 2010, was the last version based on Mozilla. Starting with version 3, Flock was based on Chromium and so used the WebKit rendering engine. Flock was available as a free download, and supported Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms (previously also Linux).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flock_Screenshot.png/300px-Flock_Screenshot.png
