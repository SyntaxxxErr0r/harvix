The plant is in shutdown status and is in preparation for decontamination and decommissioning (D&amp;D), with some facilities overseen by the United States Enrichment Corporation, a subsidiary of USEC Incorporated, a publicly traded corporation (NYSE: USU). The D&amp;D work on the older facilities to prepare the site for future use is expected to continue through 2024 and is being conducted by Fluor-B&amp;W Portsmouth LLC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Portsmouth_Gaseous_Diffusion_Plant.jpg/220px-Portsmouth_Gaseous_Diffusion_Plant.jpg
