29.14	Allied	Allies	In everyday English usage, allies are people, groups, or nations that have joined together in an association for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out between them. When the term is used in the context of war or armed struggle, such associations may also be called allied powers, especially when discussing World War I or World War II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Childe_Hassam_-_Allies_Day.jpg/220px-Childe_Hassam_-_Allies_Day.jpg
