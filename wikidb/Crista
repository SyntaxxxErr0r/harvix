8.21	Crista	Crista	Cristae (singular crista) are the internal compartments formed by the inner membrane of a mitochondrion. They are studded with proteins, including ATP synthase and a variety of cytochromes. The maximum surface for chemical reactions to occur is within the mitochondria. This allows cellular respiration (aerobic respiration since the mitochondrion requires oxygen) to occur.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Mitochondrie.svg/300px-Mitochondrie.svg.png
