59.2	Merino	Merino	The Merino is an economically influential breed of sheep prized for its wool. Merinos are regarded as having some of the finest and softest wool of any sheep. Poll Merinos have no horns (or very small stubs, known as scurs), and horned Merino rams have long, spiral horns which grow close to the head.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Merino_sheep.png
