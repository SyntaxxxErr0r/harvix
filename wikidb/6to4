73.8	6to4	6to4	6to4 is an Internet transition mechanism for migrating from IPv4 to IPv6, a system that allows IPv6 packets to be transmitted over an IPv4 network (generally the IPv4 Internet) without the need to configure explicit tunnels. Special relay servers are also in place that allow 6to4 networks to communicate with native IPv6 networks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/6to4.svg/220px-6to4.svg.png
