2.32	Tubocurarine_chloride	Tubocurarine chloride	Tubocurarine (also known as D-tubocurare or DTC) is a neuromuscular-blocking drug or skeletal muscle relaxant in the category of non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drugs, used adjunctively in anesthesia to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Unlike a number of other related skeletal muscle relaxants, it is now rarely considered clinically to facilitate endotracheal intubation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Tubocurarine.svg/220px-Tubocurarine.svg.png
