1.00	Graber	Graber	Graber (also known as Carrosserie Hermann Graber) was a coachbuilder based in Wichtrach in central Switzerland. Between 1927 and 1970 the firm supplied coach-built bodies for fitting on the chassis of various European and US auto-makers. Graber had a particularly close relationship with the British firm of Alvis, providing the manufacturer with bespoke and elegant if expensive bodies for almost twenty years, mostly during the 1950s and 1960s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/1967_Graber_Alvis_front.jpg/220px-1967_Graber_Alvis_front.jpg
