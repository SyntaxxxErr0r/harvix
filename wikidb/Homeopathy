311.9	Homeopathy	Homeopathy	Homeopathy (also spelled homoeopathy or hom≈ìopathy) is a form of alternative medicine. Practitioners claim to treat patients using preparations that are highly diluted from constituents believed to cause healthy people to exhibit symptoms that are similar to those exhibited by the patient. The collective weight of scientific evidence has found homeopathy to be no more effective than a placebo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/LedumPalustre15CH.jpg/250px-LedumPalustre15CH.jpg
