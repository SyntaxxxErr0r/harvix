1.10	Nepenthes_villosa	Nepenthes villosa	Nepenthes villosa ( ), or the Villose Pitcher-Plant, is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon in northeastern Borneo. It grows at higher altitudes than any other Bornean Nepenthes species, occurring at elevations of over 3200 m. Nepenthes villosa is characterised by its highly-developed and intricate peristome, which distinguishes it from the closely related N. edwardsiana and N. macrophylla.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Nepenthes_villosa.jpg/220px-Nepenthes_villosa.jpg
