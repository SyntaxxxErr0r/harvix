51.1	Retro-futurism	Retro-futurism	Retro-futurism (adjective retro-futuristic or retro-future) is a trend in the creative arts showing the influence of depictions of the future produced prior to about 1960. Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned "retro" styles with futuristic technology, retro-futurism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of technology. Primarily reflected in artistic creations and modified technologies that realize the imagined artifacts of its parallel reality, retro-futurism has also manifested in the worlds of fashion, architecture, literature and film.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Diesel_Forces.jpg/300px-Diesel_Forces.jpg
