88.7	Doomsday_Clock	Doomsday Clock	The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face, maintained since 1947 by the board of directors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists at the University of Chicago. The closer the clock is to midnight, the closer the world is estimated to be to global disaster. The most recent officially-announced setting — five minutes to midnight (11:55pm) — was made on 10 January 2012. Reflecting international events dangerous to humankind, the clock's hands have been adjusted twenty times since its inception in 1947, when the clock was initially set to seven minutes to midnight (11:53pm).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Doomsday_clock.svg/100px-Doomsday_clock.svg.png
