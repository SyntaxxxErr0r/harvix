2.00	STS-25	STS-51-L	STS-51-L was the twenty-fifth flight of the American Space Shuttle program, using Space Shuttle Challenger, which lifted off from the Launch Complex 39-B on 28 January 1986 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This flight marked the first time an non-government civilian, schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, had flown aboard the Space Shuttle. The mission ended in disaster with the destruction of Challenger 73 seconds after lift-off and the death of all seven crewmembers. The Rogers Commission determined the cause was due to the failure of an O-ring seal on one of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/STS-51-L.svg/201px-STS-51-L.svg.png
