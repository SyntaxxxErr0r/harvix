145.7	G8	G8	The Group of Eight is a forum for the governments of eight of the world's largest economies. The forum originated with a 1975 summit hosted by France that brought together representatives of six governments: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, thus leading to the name Group of Six or G6. The summit became known as the Group of Seven or G7 the following year with the addition of Canada. In 1997, Russia was added to group which then became known as the G8. The European Union is represented within the G8 but cannot host or chair summits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/G8_organization.svg/280px-G8_organization.svg.png
