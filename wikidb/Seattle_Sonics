4.00	Seattle_Sonics	Seattle SuperSonics	The Seattle SuperSonics (also commonly referred to as the Sonics) were an American professional basketball team based in Seattle, Washington that played in the Pacific and Northwest Divisions of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1967 until 2008. Following the 2007â€“08 season, the team relocated to Oklahoma City, and now plays as the Oklahoma City Thunder. The SuperSonics nickname, logo, and color scheme will be made available to any subsequent NBA team in Seattle. According to the team's Oklahoma-based owners, the Sonics' franchise history will be "shared" between the Thunder and any future Seattle club.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/Seattle_SuperSonics_logo.png/200px-Seattle_SuperSonics_logo.png
