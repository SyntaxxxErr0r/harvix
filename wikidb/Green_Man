77.8	Green_Man	Green Man	A Green Man is a sculpture, drawing, or other representation of a face surrounded by or made from leaves. Branches or vines may sprout from the nose, mouth, nostrils or other parts of the face and these shoots may bear flowers or fruit. Commonly used as a decorative architectural ornament, Green Men are frequently found on carvings in churches and other buildings (both secular and ecclesiastical). "The Green Man" is also a popular name for English public houses and various interpretations of the name appear on inn signs, which sometimes show a full figure rather than just the head.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Domreiter%2C_Blattmaske.jpg/220px-Domreiter%2C_Blattmaske.jpg
