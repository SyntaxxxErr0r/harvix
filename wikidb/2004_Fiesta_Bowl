2.40	2004_Fiesta_Bowl	2004 Fiesta Bowl	The 2004 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, played on January 2, 2004, was the 33rd edition of the Fiesta Bowl. The game pitted #7 Ohio State against #8 Kansas State. It was a match-up between a perennial powerhouse in Ohio State, and a school that was only recently accustomed to winning in Kansas State. Despite Kansas State's historically losing record, head coach Bill Snyder had turned around the program in the decade prior to the bowl game, and K-State was actually making its second Fiesta Bowl appearance in 7 years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Fiesta_Bowl_logo_pre-2007.png/150px-Fiesta_Bowl_logo_pre-2007.png
