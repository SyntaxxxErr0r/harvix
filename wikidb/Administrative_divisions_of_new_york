3.21	Administrative_divisions_of_new_york	Administrative divisions of New York	The administrative divisions of New York are the various units of government that provide local government services in the state of New York. The state has four types of multi-purpose municipal corporation that provide most local government services, namely: counties, cities, towns, and villages. New York also has various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school and fire districts. Whether a municipality is defined as a city, town, or village is not dependent on population or land area, but rather by the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the state legislature. Each such government is granted varying home rule powers as provided by the New York Constitution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Town_and_village_halls%2C_Monroe%2C_NY.jpg/300px-Town_and_village_halls%2C_Monroe%2C_NY.jpg
