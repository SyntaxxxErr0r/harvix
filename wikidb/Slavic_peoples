93.4	Slavic_peoples	Slavic peoples	The Slavic peoples are an Indo-European ethno-linguistic group living in Europe, North and Central Asia. The term Slavic represents people who speak languages belonging to the Slavic language family and share, to varying degrees, certain cultural traits and historical backgrounds. From the early 6th century they spread to inhabit most of Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans. In addition to their main population centre in Europe, some East Slavs (Russians) also settled later in Siberia and Central Asia. Part of all Slavic ethnicities emigrated to other parts of the world. Over half of Europe's territory is inhabited by Slavic-speaking communities. The worldwide population of people of Slavic descent is close to 400 million.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Slavic_World.png/220px-Slavic_World.png
