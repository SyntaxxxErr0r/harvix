4.31	Ambystoma	Mole salamander	The mole salamanders are a group of salamanders endemic to North America, the only genus in the family Ambystomatidae. The group has become famous due to the presence of the Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), widely used in research, and the Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum, Ambystoma mavortium) which is the official amphibian of many states, and often sold as a pet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/SpottedSalamander.jpg/220px-SpottedSalamander.jpg
