It began as a solo recording project in the early 1980s to subvert the total media and propaganda onslaught of P. W. Bothaâ€™s Apartheid South Africa. With guest musicians, the Kalahari Surfers recorded five albums, toured Europe and played concerts in East Berlin, Moscow, Riga and Leningrad.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/BEAT_APART.jpg/220px-BEAT_APART.jpg
