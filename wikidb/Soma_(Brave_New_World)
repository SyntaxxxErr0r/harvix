Set in London of AD 2540 (632 A.F. in the book), the novel anticipates developments in reproductive technology and sleep-learning that combine to change society. The future society is an embodiment of the ideals that form the basis of futurology. Huxley answered this book with a reassessment in an essay, Brave New World Revisited (1958) and with his final work, a novel titled Island (1962).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/BraveNewWorld_FirstEdition.jpg/200px-BraveNewWorld_FirstEdition.jpg
