127.1	Dalai_Lama	Dalai Lama	The Dalai Lama is a high lama in the Gelug or "Yellow Hat" branch of Tibetan Buddhism. The name is a combination of the Mongolian word далай (dalai) meaning "Ocean" and the Tibetan word bla-ma (with a silent "b") meaning "teacher". According to the current Dalai Lama , the Tibetan word "lama" corresponds precisely to the better known Sanskrit word "guru".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/1st_Dalai_Lama.jpg/220px-1st_Dalai_Lama.jpg
