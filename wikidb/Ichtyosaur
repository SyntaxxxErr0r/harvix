During the middle Triassic Period, ichthyosaurs evolved from as-yet unidentified land reptiles that moved back into the water, in a development parallel to that of the ancestors of modern-day dolphins and whales. They were particularly abundant in the Jurassic Period, until they were replaced as the top aquatic predators by another reptilian order named plesiosaurs in the Cretaceous Period. They belong to the order known as Ichthyosauria or Ichthyopterygia ('fish flippers' - a designation introduced by Sir Richard Owen in 1840, although the term is now used more for the parent clade of the Ichthyosauria).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Temnodontosaurus_trigonodon_mounted_skeleton.JPG/250px-Temnodontosaurus_trigonodon_mounted_skeleton.JPG
