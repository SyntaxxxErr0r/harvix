72.1	BNC_connector	BNC connector	The BNC connector (Bayonet Neillâ€“Concelman or British Naval Connector) is a miniature quick connect/disconnect RF connector used for coaxial cable. It features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is achieved with only a quarter turn of the coupling nut. BNCs are ideally suited for cable termination for miniature-to-subminiature coaxial cable (e.g., RG-58, 59, to RG-179, RG-316). It is used with radio, television, and other radio-frequency electronic equipment, test instruments, video signals, and was once a popular computer network connector. BNC connectors are made to match the characteristic impedance of cable at either 50 ohms or 75 ohms. It is usually applied for frequencies below 3 GHz and voltages below 500 Volts. Similar connectors using the bayonet connection principle exist, and a threaded connector is also available. MIL-PRF-39012 entitled Connectors, Coaxial, Radio Frequency, General Specification for (formerly MIL-C-39012) covers the general requirements and tests for radio frequency connectors used with flexible cables and certain other types of coaxial transmission lines in military, aerospace, and spaceflight applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/BNC-Technik.jpg/220px-BNC-Technik.jpg
