144.1	Apple_Terminal	Terminal (OS X)	Terminal (also referred to as Terminal.app) is a terminal emulator included in Apple's OS X operating system. It originated in OS X's predecessors, NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP, and allows the user to interact with the computer through a command line interface. It provides an environment for Unix shells, which, among other things, allow the OS X user to visually interact with the system core. Terminal features include tabs and customization of styles such as fonts and colors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/Appleterminal2.png/220px-Appleterminal2.png
