58.5	Thoughtcrime	Thoughtcrime	In the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, a thoughtcrime is an illegal type of thought. In the book, the government attempts to control not only the speech and actions, but also the thoughts of its subjects, labelling disapproved thought as thoughtcrime or, in Newspeak, "crimethink". In the book, Winston Smith, the main character, writes in his diary: "Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime is death."
