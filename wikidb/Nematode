72.7	Nematode	Nematode	The nematodes ( ) or roundworms are the most diverse phylum of pseudocoelomates, and one of the most diverse of all animals. Nematode species are very difficult to distinguish; over 28,000 have been described, of which over 16,000 are parasitic. The total number of nematode species has been estimated to be about 1,000,000. Unlike cnidarians or flatworms, roundworms have tubular digestive systems with openings at both ends.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Roundworm.jpg
