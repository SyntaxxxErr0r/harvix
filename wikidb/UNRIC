2.22	UNRIC	UNRIC	The main task of the United Nations Regional Information Centre (UNRIC) is to spread the UN message, raise awareness and create understanding of issues relating to the United Nations' objectives. UNRIC serves the Western European Region by providing and disseminating UN information material, UN reports and documents, press kits, posters, fact sheets and brochures. The intention is to reach out to all segments of society and therefore the UNRIC Reference Library is open to all inquiries about the UN via telephone, e-mail and post. UN documents and publications are available in English, French and Spanish, but some material is also available in other European languages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b1/UnitedNationsRegionalInformationCentre_logo.png
