1.00	Amazing_Adult_Fantasy_(album)	Amazing Adult Fantasy (album)	Amazing Adult Fantasy is the fifth album released by novelty rock group Barnes &amp; Barnes. It was originally released in 1984 by Rhino Records, and rereleased in 2005 by Oglio Records. After the failure of their previous effort, the Soak It Up EP, Barnes &amp; Barnes were dropped from Boulevard Records, and promptly re-signed with Rhino Records. This album showcases the later stage of their effort to abandon novelty music and record more contemporary material, although the album does contain some comedic elements. Despite this, it is the lowest-selling Barnes &amp; Barnes album of all time. The title is derived from the Marvel comic book Amazing Adult Fantasy, and features the cover of issue #10 in the album art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2e/AAFantasy.jpg/220px-AAFantasy.jpg
