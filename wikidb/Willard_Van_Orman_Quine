57.8	Willard_Van_Orman_Quine	Willard Van Orman Quine	Willard Van Orman Quine (June 25, 1908 â€“ December 25, 2000) (known to intimates as "Van") was an American philosopher and logician in the analytic tradition. From 1930 until his death 70 years later, Quine was continuously affiliated with Harvard University in one way or another, first as a student, then as a professor of philosophy and a teacher of mathematics, and finally as a professor emeritus who published or revised several books in retirement. He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978. A recent poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine one of the five most important philosophers of the past two centuries. He won the first Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy in 1993, for "his systematical and penetrating discussions of how learning of language and communication are based on socially available evidence and of the consequences of this for theories on knowledge and linguistic meaning."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Wvq-passport-1975-400dpi-crop.jpg/220px-Wvq-passport-1975-400dpi-crop.jpg
