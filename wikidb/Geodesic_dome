176.6	Geodesic_dome	Geodesic dome	A geodesic dome is a spherical or partial-spherical shell structure or lattice shell based on a network of great circles on the surface of a sphere. The geodesics intersect to form triangular elements that have local triangular rigidity and also distribute the stress across the structure. When completed to form a complete sphere, it is a geodesic sphere. A dome is enclosed, unlike open geodesic structures such as playground climbers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Epcot07.jpg/375px-Epcot07.jpg
