3.01	Black_oystercatcher	Oystercatcher	The oystercatchers are a group of waders; they form the family Haematopodidae, which has a single genus, Haematopus. They are found on coasts worldwide apart from the polar regions and some tropical regions of Africa and South East Asia. The exception to this is the Eurasian Oystercatcher and the South Island Oystercatcher, both of which breed inland, far inland in some cases. In the past there has been a great deal of confusion as to the species limits, with discrete populations of all black oystercatchers being afforded specific status but pied oystercatchers being considered one single species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Haematopus_longirostris_2.jpg/220px-Haematopus_longirostris_2.jpg
