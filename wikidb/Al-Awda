2.00	Al-Awda	Palestinian right of return	The Palestinian right of return is a political position or principle asserting that Palestinian refugees, both first-generation refugees and their descendants, have a right to return, and a right to the property they or their forebears left or which they were forced to leave in what is now Israel and the Palestinian territories (formerly part of the British Mandate of Palestine), as part of the 1948 Palestinian exodus, a result of the 1948 Palestine war and due to the 1967 Six-Day War.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Resolution_194.jpg/200px-Resolution_194.jpg
