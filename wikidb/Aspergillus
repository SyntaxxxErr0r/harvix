56.6	Aspergillus	Aspergillus	Aspergillus (IPA: ˌæspəˈdʒɪləs) is a genus consisting of several hundred mold species found in various climates worldwide. Aspergillus was first catalogued in 1729 by the Italian priest and biologist Pier Antonio Micheli. Viewing the fungi under a microscope, Micheli was reminded of the shape of an aspergillum (holy water sprinkler), from Latin spargere (to sprinkle), and named the genus accordingly. Today "aspergillum" is also the name of an asexual spore-forming structure common to all Aspergilli; around one-third of species are also known to have a sexual stage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Aspergillus_niger_01.jpg/250px-Aspergillus_niger_01.jpg
