161.1	Honeypot_(computing)	Honeypot (computing)	An e-mail address that is not used for any other purpose than to receive spam can also be considered a spam honeypot. Compared with the term spamtrap, the term "honeypot" might better be reserved for systems and techniques used to detect or counter attacks and probes. Spam arrives at its destination "legitimately"â€”exactly as non-spam e-mail would arrive.
