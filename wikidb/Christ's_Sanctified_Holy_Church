1.10	Christ's_Sanctified_Holy_Church	Christ's Sanctified Holy Church	Christ's Sanctified Holy Church is a holiness denomination located primarily in the Southeastern United States. The group was organized on February 14, 1892, when members of the Methodist Episcopal Church on Chincoteague Island, Virginia, became convinced that they could not be saved without experiencing the "second blessing," i.e. entire sanctification. The group was under the leadership of Joseph B. Lynch. Christ's Sanctified Holy Church grew significantly during the first part of the 20th century as members traveled across the country preaching the doctrines of holiness and sanctification.
