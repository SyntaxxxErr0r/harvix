287.7	Geotagging	Geotagging	Geotagging can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information. For instance, one can find images taken near a given location by entering latitude and longitude coordinates into a suitable image search engine. Geotagging-enabled information services can also potentially be used to find location-based news, websites, or other resources. Geotagging can tell users the location of the content of a given picture or other media or the point of view, and conversely on some media platforms show media relevant to a given location.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Geotagging_gThumb.png/220px-Geotagging_gThumb.png
