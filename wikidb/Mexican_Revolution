65.7	Mexican_Revolution	Mexican Revolution	The Mexican Revolution (Spanish: ) was a major armed struggle that started in 1910, with an uprising led by Francisco I. Madero against longtime autocrat Porfirio DÃ­az, and lasted for the better part of two decades until around 1929. The Revolution was characterized by several socialist, liberal, anarchist, populist, and agrarian movements. Over time the Revolution changed from a revolt against the established order to a multi-sided civil war. This armed conflict is often categorized as the most important sociopolitical event in Mexico and one of the greatest upheavals of the 20th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Colage_revoluci%C3%B3n_mexicana.jpg/300px-Colage_revoluci%C3%B3n_mexicana.jpg
