102.5	CMOS	CMOS	Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor ( ) is a technology for constructing integrated circuits. CMOS technology is used in microprocessors, microcontrollers, static RAM, and other digital logic circuits. CMOS technology is also used for several analog circuits such as image sensors (CMOS sensor), data converters, and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication. Frank Wanlass patented CMOS in 1967 (US patent 3,356,858).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/CMOS_Inverter.svg/220px-CMOS_Inverter.svg.png
