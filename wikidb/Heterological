2.10	Heterological	Autological word	An autological word (also called homological word) is a word expressing a property which it also possesses itself (the word "short" is short, "common" is common, "noun" is a noun, "English" is English, "pentasyllabic" has five syllables, "word" is a word). The opposite is heterological, a word that does not apply to itself ("long" is not long, "banana" is not a banana, "Englisch" is German).
