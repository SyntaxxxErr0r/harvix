66.7	Wayne_Thiebaud	Wayne Thiebaud	Wayne Thiebaud (born November 15, 1920) is an American painter whose most famous works are of cakes, pastries, boots, toilets, toys and lipsticks. He is associated with the Pop art movement because of his interest in objects of mass culture, although his works, executed during the fifties and sixties, slightly predate the works of the classic pop artists. Thiebaud uses heavy pigment and exaggerated colors to depict his subjects, and the well-defined shadows characteristic of advertisements are almost always included in his work.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2e/WayneThiebaudThreeMachines.jpg/300px-WayneThiebaudThreeMachines.jpg
