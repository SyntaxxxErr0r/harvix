70.7	Reagan_assassination_attempt	Reagan assassination attempt	The Reagan assassination attempt occurred on Monday, March 30, 1981, just 69 days into the presidency of Ronald Reagan. While leaving a speaking engagement at the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., President Reagan and three others were shot and wounded by John Hinckley, Jr. Reagan suffered a punctured lung, but prompt medical attention allowed him to recover quickly. No formal invocation of presidential succession took place, although Secretary of State Alexander Haig controversially stated that he was "in control here" while Vice President George H. W. Bush returned to Washington. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity and remains confined to a psychiatric facility.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Reagan_assassination_attempt_montage.jpg/300px-Reagan_assassination_attempt_montage.jpg
