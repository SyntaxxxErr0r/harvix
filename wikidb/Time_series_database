3.20	Time_series_database	Time series database	A time series database server (TSDS) is a software system that is optimized for handling a time series. In this context, a time series is an associative array of numbers indexed by a datetime or a datetime range. These time series are often called profiles or curves, depending upon the market. A time series of stock prices might be called a price curve, or a time series of energy consumption might be called a load profile. Despite the disparate naming, the operations performed on them are sufficiently common as to demand special database treatment.
