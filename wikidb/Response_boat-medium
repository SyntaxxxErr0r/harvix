3.20	Response_boat-medium	Response Boat-Medium	The response boat-medium (RBM) is a 45-foot (13.7m) utility boat used by the United States Coast Guard. It is intended as a replacement for the Coast Guard’s fleet of 41′ utility boats (UTB), which have been in use by the Coast Guard since the 1970s. The Coast Guard plans to acquire 180 of these RB-Ms over a 6–10 year period. The boats will be built by Kvichak Marine Industries of Kent, Washington and Marinette Marine of Manitowoc, Wisconsin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/USCG_response_boat_medium_45607_Yorktown.jpg/220px-USCG_response_boat_medium_45607_Yorktown.jpg
