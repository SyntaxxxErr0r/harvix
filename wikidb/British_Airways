British Airways is the largest airline in the UK based on fleet size, international flights and international destinations and second largest measured by passengers carried, behind easyJet. BA's UK passengers originating at non-London airports must connect via London after British Airways discontinued all direct overseas flights from UK airports outside London following the sale of BA Connect to British regional carrier Flybe in 2007.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/British_Airways_Logo.svg/225px-British_Airways_Logo.svg.png
