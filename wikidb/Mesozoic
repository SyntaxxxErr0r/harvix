59.4	Mesozoic	Mesozoic	The Mesozoic Era is an interval of geological time from about 250 million years ago to about 65 million years ago. It is often referred to as the Age of Reptiles because reptiles, namely dinosaurs, were the dominant terrestrial and marine vertebrates of the time. The era began in the wake of the Permian-Triassic event, the largest mass extinction in Earth's history, and ended with the Cretaceous-Paleogene event, another mass extinction which is known for having killed off non-avian dinosaurs, as well as other plant and animal species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/LateJurassicGlobal.jpg/220px-LateJurassicGlobal.jpg
