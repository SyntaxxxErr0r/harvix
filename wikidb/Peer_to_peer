59.4	Peer_to_peer	Peer-to-peer	Peer-to-peer (abbreviated to P2P) refers to a computer network in which each computer in the network can act as a client or server for the other computers in the network, allowing shared access to files and peripherals without the need for a central server. P2P networks can be set up in the home, a business or over the Internet. Each network type requires all computers in the network to use the same or a compatible program to connect to each other and access files and other resources found on the other computer. P2P networks can be used for sharing content such as audio, video, data or anything in digital format.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/P2P-network.svg/200px-P2P-network.svg.png
