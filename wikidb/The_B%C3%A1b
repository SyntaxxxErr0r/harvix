4.43	The_B%C3%A1b	Báb	Siyyid `Alí Muḥammad Shírází . After his declaration he took the title of Báb (Arabic: ‎) meaning "Gate". He composed hundreds of letters and books (often termed tablets) in which he stated his messianic claims and defined his teachings, which constituted a new sharí'ah or religious law. His movement eventually acquired tens of thousands of supporters, was opposed by Iran's Shi'a clergy, and was suppressed by the Iranian government, leading to the persecution and killing of thousands of his followers, called Bábís. In 1850, at the age of thirty, the Báb was shot by a firing squad in Tabríz.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Shrine_Bab_North_West.jpg/200px-Shrine_Bab_North_West.jpg
