In smaller circuses, the ringmaster is often the owner and artistic director of the circus. Many modern-day ringmasters become an integral part of the performance, singing and dancing along with the other entertainers. He is called "Monsieur Loyal" in French, after the name of Anselme-Pierre Loyal (1753-1826), one of the first renowned circus personalities.
