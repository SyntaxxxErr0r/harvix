53.9	Selkie	Selkie	Selkies (also known as silkies or selchies) are mythological creatures found in Faroese, Icelandic, Irish, and Scottish folklore. The word derives from earlier Scots selich, (from Old English seolh meaning seal). Selkies are said to live as seals in the sea but shed their skin to become human on land. The legend apparently originated on the Orkney and Shetland Islands.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Faroese_stamp_580_the_seal_woman.jpg/220px-Faroese_stamp_580_the_seal_woman.jpg
