84.5	Arminianism	Arminianism	Arminianism is a school of soteriological thought within Protestant Christianity based on the theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560â€“1609) and his historic followers, the Remonstrants. The doctrine's acceptance stretches through much of Christianity from the early arguments between Athanasius and Origen, to Augustine of Hippo's defense of "original sin."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Arminius_5_flopped_and_cropped.png/125px-Arminius_5_flopped_and_cropped.png
