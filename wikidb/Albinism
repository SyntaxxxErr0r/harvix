88.8	Albinism	Albinism	Albinism (from Latin albus, "white"; see extended etymology, also called achromia, achromasia, or achromatosis) is a congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes due to absence or defect of an enzyme involved in the production of melanin. Albinism results from inheritance of recessive gene alleles and is known to affect all vertebrates, including humans. While an organism with complete absence of melanin is called an albino ( , or ), an organism with only a diminished amount of melanin is described as albinoid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Albinisitic_man_portrait.jpg/230px-Albinisitic_man_portrait.jpg
