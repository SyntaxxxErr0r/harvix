3.00	Battle_Harbour	Battle Harbour	Battle Harbour is a 19th century summer fishing station, formerly a permanent settlement, located on the Labrador coast in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Battle Harbour was for two centuries the economic and social centre of the southeastern Labrador coast. Mercantile saltfish premises first established there in the 1770s developed into a thriving community that was known as the Capital of Labrador. After six years of research and painstaking architectural restoration, the efforts of the Battle Harbour Historic Trust have breathed new life into this place. Battle Harbour has been restored to its former glory and a living commemoration to the life and society created there by Newfoundlanders and Labradorians during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/BattleHarbour_Labrador_2008.JPG/220px-BattleHarbour_Labrador_2008.JPG
