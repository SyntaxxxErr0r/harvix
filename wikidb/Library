152.9	Library	Library	A library is an organized collection of books, other printed materials, and in some cases special materials such as manuscripts, films and other sources of information. Its collections can be of print, audio, or visual materials, including maps, prints, documents, microform (e.g. microfilm/microfiche), CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, video games, e-books, audiobooks and many other types of electronic resource. The places where this material is stored include public libraries, subscription libraries, and private libraries, and material can also be in digital form, stored on computers or accessible over the Internet. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books in a small organization's library to collections of several million items in the larger national and academic libraries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Melk_-_Abbey_-_Library.jpg/300px-Melk_-_Abbey_-_Library.jpg
