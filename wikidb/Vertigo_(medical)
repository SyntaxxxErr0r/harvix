51.4	Vertigo_(medical)	Vertigo	Vertigo (from the Latin vertō "a whirling or spinning movement") is a type of dizziness, where there is a feeling of motion when one is stationary. The symptoms are due to a dysfunction of the vestibular system in the inner ear. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting as well as difficulties standing or walking. There are three types of vertigo: objective− subjects are moving around the patient; subjective− patient feels as if moving himself; pseudovertigo− intensive sensation of rotation inside the patient's head.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Optokinetic_nystagmus.gif
