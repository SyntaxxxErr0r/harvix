38.28	A._E._Housman	A. E. Housman	Alfred Edward Housman (26 March 1859 â€“ 30 April 1936), usually known as A. E. Housman, was an English classical scholar and poet, best known to the general public for his cycle of poems A Shropshire Lad. Lyrical and almost epigrammatic in form, the poems were mostly written before 1900. Their wistful evocation of doomed youth in the English countryside, in spare language and distinctive imagery, appealed strongly to late Victorian and Edwardian taste, and to many early 20th century English composers (beginning with Arthur Somervell) both before and after the First World War. Through its song-setting the poetry became closely associated with that era, and with Shropshire itself.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Alfred_Edward_Housman.jpeg/220px-Alfred_Edward_Housman.jpeg
