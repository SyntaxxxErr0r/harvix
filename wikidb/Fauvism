51.5	Fauvism	Fauvism	Fauvism is the style of les Fauves (French for "the wild beasts"), a short-lived and loose group of early twentieth-century Modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong colour over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism. While Fauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1904–1908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were Henri Matisse and André Derain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/Matisse_-_Green_Line.jpeg/220px-Matisse_-_Green_Line.jpeg
