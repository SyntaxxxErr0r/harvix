4.00	Himinbj%C3%B6rg	Himinbjörg	In Norse mythology, Himinbjörg is the home of the god Heimdallr. Himinbjörg is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Himinbjörg is associated with Heimdallr in all sources. According to the Poetic Edda, Heimdallr dwells there as watchman for the gods and there drinks fine mead, whereas in the Prose Edda Himinbjörg is detailed as located where the burning rainbow bridge Bifröst meets heaven. Scholars have commented on the differences between the two attestations and linked the name of the mythical location to various place names.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Heimdall_and_little_Hnossa_by_Willy_Pogany.png/220px-Heimdall_and_little_Hnossa_by_Willy_Pogany.png
