As we know leadership and power are closely linked. This idea shows how the different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in organizational communication and throughout the workforce. "The French-Raven power forms are introduced with consideration of the level of observability and the extent to which power is dependent or independent of structural conditions. Dependency refers to the degree of internalization that occurs among persons subject to social control. Using these considerations it is possible to link personal processes to structural conditions". (Donald Warren 1968) (Lazarfeld and Menzel 1961) French &amp; Raven introduce five bases of power Coercive, Reward, Legitimate, Referent, and Expert.
