84.3	Gordon_Freeman	Gordon Freeman	Gordon Freeman is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the Half-Life video game series. A theoretical physicist, he finds himself thrust into a battle for survival against both alien and human forces. Throughout the series, Gordon must prevail in hostile situations despite overwhelming odds, often without backup. As a means of immersing the player in the role, the character never speaks, and there are no cutscenes or mission briefingsâ€”all action is viewed through Gordon's eyes, with the player retaining control of Gordon's actions at nearly all times. The images of Gordon are only seen on the game's cover and menu pages, and also in advertisements, making them marketing tools rather than pictures of what Gordon is "really like". Designer Gabe Newell has explicitly rejected giving the in-game Gordon a face or voice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Gordon_Freeman.png/240px-Gordon_Freeman.png
