51.0	Definition_of_terrorism	Definitions of terrorism	There is neither an academic nor an international legal consensus regarding the definition of the term "terrorism". Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions of "terrorism". Moreover, the international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed upon, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term "terrorism" is politically and emotionally charged.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Terrorism2_london_times_1-30-1795.jpg/300px-Terrorism2_london_times_1-30-1795.jpg
