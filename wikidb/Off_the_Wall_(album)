While working on that project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album. Recording sessions took place between December 1978 and June 1979 at Allen Zentz Recording, Westlake Recording Studios, and Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California. Jackson collaborated with a number of other writers and performers such as Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton. Five singles were released from the album. Three of the singles had music videos released. Jackson wrote several of the songs himself, including the Platinum-certified lead single, "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough". It was his first solo release under Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death in 2009.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Off_the_wall.jpg/220px-Off_the_wall.jpg
