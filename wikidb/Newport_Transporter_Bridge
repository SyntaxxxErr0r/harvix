It is a Grade I listed structure. Designed by French engineer Ferdinand Arnodin, it was built in 1906 and opened by Godfrey Charles Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar on 12 September 1906. The span is an example of the very rare transporter bridge concept, of which only eight remain in use worldwide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Newport_Transporter_Bridge_2002.jpg/250px-Newport_Transporter_Bridge_2002.jpg
