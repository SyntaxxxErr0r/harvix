3.00	Stuf	Kings of the Isle of Wight	The Isle of Wight is a 147-square-mile (380 km2) island off the south coast of England. The first Kings of the Isle of Wight were recorded by St Bede in 512CE as Stuf and Wihtgar,the nephews of Cerdic, the founder of the Wessex dynasty, then known as the "Allies" or "Gewisse". However, the name for the "Men of Wight" was "Wihtwara" and their fort "Wihtwarasburgh". Hence it is conjectured (by Stenton, Yorke et al.) that Wihtgar was a made-up name to account for this. Although the dynasty has never been given a name, presumably they would be named after their founderâ€”as the kings of Kent and East Anglia were (the "Oiscings" and "Wuffings" respectively after Oisc and after Wuffa). Hence the Isle of Wight dynasty may have been the "Stuffings".
