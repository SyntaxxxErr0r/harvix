15.21	Columbia_Gorge	Columbia River Gorge	The Columbia River Gorge is a canyon of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Up to 4,000 feet (1,200 m) deep, the canyon stretches for over 80 miles (130 km) as the river winds westward through the Cascade Range forming the boundary between the State of Washington to the north and Oregon to the south. Extending roughly from the confluence of the Columbia with the Deschutes River down to eastern reaches of the Portland metropolitan area, the gorge furnishes the only navigable route through the Cascades and the only water connection between the Columbia River Plateau and the Pacific Ocean.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Columbia_river_gorge_from_crown_point.jpg/256px-Columbia_river_gorge_from_crown_point.jpg
