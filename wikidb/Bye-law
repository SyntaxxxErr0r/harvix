1.00	Bye-law	By-law	Municipal by-laws are public regulatory laws which apply in a certain area. The main difference between a by-law and a law passed by a national/federal or regional/state body is that a bylaw is made by a non-sovereign body, which derives its authority from another governing body, and can only be made on a limited range of matters. A local council or municipal government gets its power to pass laws through a law of the national or regional government which specifies what things the town or city may regulate through bylaws. It is therefore a form of delegated legislation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Sign_in_a_car_park_in_Ripon%2C_North_Yorkshire.jpg/220px-Sign_in_a_car_park_in_Ripon%2C_North_Yorkshire.jpg
