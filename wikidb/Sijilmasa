7.20	Sijilmasa	Sijilmasa	Sijilmasa (also Sijilmassa, Sidjilmasa, Sidjilmassa and Sigilmassa) was a medieval Berber city and trade entrep√¥t at the northern edge of the Sahara Desert in Morocco. The ruins of the town lie along the River Ziz in the Tafilalt oasis near the town of Rissani. The town's history was marked by several successive invasions by Berber dynasties during the Golden Age of Berber Islam. Up until the 14th century, it was, as the northern terminus for the western trans-Sahara trade route, one of the most important trade centres in the Maghreb during the "Golden Age" of the Berber dynasties.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Morocco_location_map.svg/300px-Morocco_location_map.svg.png
