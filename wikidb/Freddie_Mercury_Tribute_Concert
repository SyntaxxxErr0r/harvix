The concert was produced for television by Ray Burdis and broadcast live on television and radio to 76 countries around the world, with an audience of up to one billion. The concert was a tribute to the life of the late Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury, with all proceeds going to AIDS research. The show marked bassist John Deacon's final concert with Queen (save one live appearance with Brian May, Roger Taylor and Elton John in 1997). The profits from the concert were used to launch The Mercury Phoenix Trust AIDS charity organisation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9d/Freddie_Mercury_Tribute_Concert_poster.jpg/220px-Freddie_Mercury_Tribute_Concert_poster.jpg
