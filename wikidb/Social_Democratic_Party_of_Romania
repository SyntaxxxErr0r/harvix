It was formed in 1992, after the post-communist National Salvation Front (Romania) broke apart. It adopted its present name after a merger with a minor social-democratic party in 2001. Since its formation, it has always been one of the two dominant parties of the country. The Social Democratic Party governed Romania from 1992 to 1996, and from 2000 to 2004. With Ion Iliescu, it also produced a President of the Republic, in office from the end of communism to 1996, and from 2000 to 2004.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Psd.jpg/100px-Psd.jpg
