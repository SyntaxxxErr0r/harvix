64.5	Synthpop	Synthpop	Synthpop (also known as electropop, or technopop) is a genre of popular music that first became prominent in the 1980s, in which the synthesizer is the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic art rock, disco and particularly the "Kraut rock" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the New Wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Sequential_Circuits_Prophet_5.jpg/220px-Sequential_Circuits_Prophet_5.jpg
