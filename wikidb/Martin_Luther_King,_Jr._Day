120.4	Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day	Martin Luther King, Jr. Day	Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is a United States federal holiday marking the birthday of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It is observed on the third Monday of January each year, which is around the time of King's birthday, January 15. The floating holiday is similar to holidays set under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, though the act predated the establishment of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day by 15 years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg/225px-Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg
