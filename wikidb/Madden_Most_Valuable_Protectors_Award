The trophy, sponsored by Prilosec OTC, is named in honor of former NFL coach and commentator, John Madden. Designed and sculpted by artist Tom Tsuchiya, the award's shape is meant to evoke a castle wall with the figures of the five offensive line players representing crenellation. The bronze trophy, finished with a silver nitrate patina, weighs 102 lbs (42.3 kg) and stands 16" (42 cm) tall.
