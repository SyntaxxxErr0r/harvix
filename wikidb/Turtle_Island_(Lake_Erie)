3.10	Turtle_Island_(Lake_Erie)	Turtle Island (Lake Erie)	Turtle Island is a remote 1.5 acres (0.61 ha) island in the western portion of Lake Erie in the United States. The island has unique political status, as its ownership is divided between the U.S. states of Michigan and Ohio, even though the island has no residents or use. The island is located about 5 mi (8.0 km) northeast of the mouth of the Maumee River in Maumee Bay. Today, the island houses several abandoned structures and the ruins of a lighthouse dating back to 1866.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/USA_Michigan_location_map.svg/240px-USA_Michigan_location_map.svg.png
