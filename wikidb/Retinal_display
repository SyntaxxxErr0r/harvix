1.00	Retinal_display	Virtual retinal display	A virtual retinal display (VRD), also known as a retinal scan display (RSD) or retinal projector (RP), not to be confused with a "Retina Display" as marketed by Apple, is a display technology that draws a raster display (like a television) directly onto the retina of the eye. The user sees what appears to be a conventional display floating in space in front of them. (However, the portion of the visual area where imagery appears must still intersect with optical elements of the display system. It is not possible to display an image over a solid angle from a point source unless the projection system can bypass the lenses within the eye.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Virtual_Retinal_Display_Diagram.svg/300px-Virtual_Retinal_Display_Diagram.svg.png
