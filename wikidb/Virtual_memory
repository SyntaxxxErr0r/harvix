89.2	Virtual_memory	Virtual memory	In computing, virtual memory is a memory management technique developed for multitasking kernels. This technique virtualizes a computer architecture's various forms of computer data storage (such as random-access memory and disk storage), allowing a program to be designed as though there is only one kind of memory, "virtual" memory, which behaves like directly addressable read/write memory (RAM).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Virtual_memory.svg/250px-Virtual_memory.svg.png
