59.3	Consumer_electronics	Consumer electronics	Consumer electronics are electronic equipment intended for everyday use, most often in entertainment, communications and office productivity. Radio broadcasting in the early 20th century brought the first major consumer product, the broadcast receiver. Later products include personal computers, telephones, MP3 players, audio equipment, televisions, calculators, GPS automotive electronics, digital cameras and players and recorders using video media such as DVDs, VCRs or camcorders. Increasingly these products have become based on digital technologies, and have largely merged with the computer industry in what is increasingly referred to as the consumerization of information technology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Jvc_gz-mg555-02.jpg/220px-Jvc_gz-mg555-02.jpg
