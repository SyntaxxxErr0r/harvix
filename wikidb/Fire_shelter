4.00	Fire_shelter	Fire shelter	A fire shelter is a safety device of last resort used by wildland firefighters when trapped by wildfires. It is designed to reflect radiant heat, protect against convective heat, and trap breathable air (most firefighters' deaths are from inhaling hot gases) in an attempt to save the firefighter's life. First required in the United States in 1977, fire shelters are constructed layers of aluminum foil, woven silica, and fiberglass. When deployed, its maximum dimensions are 86 in. x 15.5 in. x 31 in. (approximately 218.44 cm x 39.37 cm x 78.74 cm) and is shaped like a mound. When the shelter is packed into its carrying case, its dimensions are 8.5in. x 5.5 in. x 4 in. (approximately 21.59 cm x 13.97 cm x 10.16 cm). The new-generation fire shelter was developed in 2002 to replace the old style fire shelter which is shaped like a pup-tent and has a carrying case. Its dimensions are smaller than that of the old-generation shelter.
