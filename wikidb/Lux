79.7	Lux	Lux	The lux (symbol: lx) is the SI unit of illuminance and luminous emittance, measuring luminous flux per unit area. It is used in photometry as a measure of the intensity, as perceived by the human eye, of light that hits or passes through a surface. It is analogous to the radiometric unit watts per square metre, but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function, a standardized model of human visual brightness perception. In English, "lux" is used in both singular and plural.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Lux_meter.jpg/220px-Lux_meter.jpg
