They are attracted to light and feed on the needles of coniferous trees. They can make a hissing sound when touched or otherwise disturbed, which can resemble the hissing of a bat. This sound is made by their wings pushing down, forcing the air out between their wings and back.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Ten-Line-June-Beetle-2.JPG/240px-Ten-Line-June-Beetle-2.JPG
