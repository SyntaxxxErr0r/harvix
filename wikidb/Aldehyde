54.9	Aldehyde	Aldehyde	An aldehyde ( ) is an organic compound containing a formyl group. This functional group, with the structure R-CHO, consists of a carbonyl center (a carbon double bonded to oxygen) bonded to hydrogen and an R group, which is any generic alkyl or side chain. The group without R is called the aldehyde group or formyl group. Aldehydes differ from ketones in that the carbonyl is placed at the end of a carbon skeleton rather than between two carbon atoms. Aldehydes are common in organic chemistry. Many fragrances are aldehydes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Aldehyde.svg/150px-Aldehyde.svg.png
