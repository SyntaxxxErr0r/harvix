77.7	Carmen_Miranda	Carmen Miranda	Carmen Miranda, GCIH (Portuguese pronunciation: , 9 February 1909 â€“ 5 August 1955) was a Portuguese-born Brazilian samba singer, Broadway actress and Hollywood film star popular in the 1940s and 1950s. She was, by some accounts, the highest-earning woman in the United States and noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in the 1943 movie The Gang's All Here. Though hailed as a talented performer, her movie roles in the United States soon became cartoonish and she grew to resent them. She is considered the precursor of Brazil's Tropicalismo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Gangs_all_here_trailer.jpg
