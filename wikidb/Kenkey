6.01	Kenkey	Kenkey	Kenkey or Dokonu or Komi is a staple dish similar to a sourdough dumpling from the Akan, Ga and Ewe inhabited regions of West Africa, usually served with a soup, stew, or sauce. Areas where Kenkey are eaten are southern Ghana, eastern CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Togo, western Benin and Jamaica. It is usually made from ground corn , like sadza and ugali. Unlike ugali, making kenkey involves letting the maize ferment before cooking. Therefore, preparation takes a few days in order to let the dough ferment. After fermentation, the kenkey is partially cooked, wrapped in banana leaves, corn husks, or foil, and steamed. There are several versions of Kenkey, such as Ga and Fanti kenkey.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Fante_kenkey.jpg/275px-Fante_kenkey.jpg
