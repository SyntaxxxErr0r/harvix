1.00	Torulopsis	Candida (fungus)	Candida is a genus of yeasts. Many species are harmless commensals or endosymbionts of hosts including humans, but other species, or harmless species in the wrong location, can cause disease. Candida albicans can cause infections (candidiasis or thrush) in humans and other animals, especially in immunocompromised patients. Many species are found in gut flora, including C. albicans in mammalian hosts, whereas others live as endosymbionts in insect hosts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Candida_albicans.jpg/320px-Candida_albicans.jpg
