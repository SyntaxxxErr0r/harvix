138.3	Organization	Organization	There are a variety of legal types of organizations, including: corporations, governments, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, armed forces, charities, not-for-profit corporations, partnerships, cooperatives, and universities. A hybrid organization is a body that operates in both the public sector and the private sector, simultaneously fulfilling public duties and developing commercial market activities. As a result the hybrid organization becomes a mixture of a government and a corporate organization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg/240px-Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg
