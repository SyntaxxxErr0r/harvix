20.20	Star_Wars_Celebration	Star Wars Celebration	Star Wars Celebration is a fan gathering to celebrate the release of a Star Wars franchise movie. It all began in 1999, when Lucasfilm held the Star Wars Celebration in Denver, Colorado to celebrate the upcoming release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Subsequent events have taken place to welcome Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, as well as honoring the 30th Anniversary of the release of the original three films. The seventh such event, the fifth to be held in the United States, took place in August 2010 in Orlando, Florida.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/C3501st.jpg/220px-C3501st.jpg
