108.1	French_and_Indian_War	French and Indian War	The French and Indian War (1754-1763) is the name for the North American theater of the Seven Years War. The war was fought primarily between the colonies of Great Britain and New France, with both sides supported by military troops from Europe. In 1756, the war erupted into the world-wide conflict involving Britain and France. In Canada, some historians refer to the conflict as simply the Seven Years' War, although French Canadians often call it La guerre de la ConquÃªte ("The War of Conquest"). In Europe, there is no specific name for the North American part of the war. The name refers to the two main enemies of the British colonists: the royal French forces and the various Native American forces allied with them, although Great Britain also had Native allies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/French_and_Indian_War.png/250px-French_and_Indian_War.png
