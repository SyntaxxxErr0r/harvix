3.00	Francesco_Sannino	Francesco Sannino	Francesco Sannino (Torre del Greco, February 9, 1968) is an Italian theoretical physicist and a professor at the University of Southern Denmark. He is an expert in effective field theories and their applications to strongly coupled theories such as quantum chromodynamics. He is also an expert in beyond standard model physics and quantum field theory. He received a bachelor's degree at the University of Naples, Federico II in 1992 and soon after won the INFN fellowship for young researchers. He has two PhD degrees awarded simultaneously in physics in 1997, one from the University of Syracuse and the other from the University of Naples. In 1997 he was hired at Yale as a research fellow, and in 2000 he moved to NORDITA (Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics) as a research fellow. In 2004 he won the Marie Curie Excellence Grant awarded by the European Commission and became Marie Curie fellow while associate professor at the Niels Bohr Institute. In 2007 he has been a paid associate at CERN while becoming full professor at the University of Southern Denmark. In 2009 the centre of excellence for particle physics phenomenology was formed under his leadership by the Danish Research Foundation. In 2010 he was awarded the Elite Researcher Prize by the Danish Ministry of Science.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/FrancescoSannino.jpg/220px-FrancescoSannino.jpg
