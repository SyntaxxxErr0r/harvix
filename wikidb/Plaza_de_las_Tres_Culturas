The name "Three Cultures" is in recognition of the three periods of Mexican history reflected by those buildings pre-Columbian, Spanish colonial, and the independent "mestizo" nation. The plaza, designed by Mexican architect and urbanist Mario Pani, was completed in 1966.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/PLAZA_DE_LAS_TRES_CULTURAS-1.jpg/220px-PLAZA_DE_LAS_TRES_CULTURAS-1.jpg
