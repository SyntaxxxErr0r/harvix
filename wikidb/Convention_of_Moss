6.00	Convention_of_Moss	Convention of Moss	The Convention of Moss was a cease fire agreement, signed August 14, 1814, between the Swedish King and the Norwegian government. It followed the Swedish-Norwegian War due to Norway's claim to sovereignty. It also became the de facto peace agreement and formed the basis for the personal union between Sweden and Norway that was established when the Norwegian Storting (Parliament) elected Charles XIII of Sweden as king of Norway on 4 November 1814. The Union lasted until Norway declared its dissolution in 1905.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Moss_Ironworks_main_office2005-20-03.jpg/220px-Moss_Ironworks_main_office2005-20-03.jpg
