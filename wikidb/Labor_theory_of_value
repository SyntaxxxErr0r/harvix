77.2	Labor_theory_of_value	Labor theory of value	Many economists believe that the Marxist labor theory of value has been "discredited". The criticism revolves around the undue stress Marx put on labor, ignoring other sources of value (such as technology or know-how). Nonetheless certain elements of the theory are still believed to be valid , in particular, argument that interests of employee and employer are not the same, and that markets do not have a long-term tendency towards stability and equilibrium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Marx_color2.jpg/110px-Marx_color2.jpg
