4.00	Gonzalo_S%E1nchez_de_Lozada	Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada	Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada y Sánchez de Bustamante (born July 1, 1930), familiarly known as "Goni", is a Bolivian politician, businessman, and former President of Bolivia. A lifelong member of the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR), he is credited for using "shock therapy", the economic theory championed by then Harvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs. This measure was used by Bolivia in 1985 (when Sánchez de Lozada was Minister of Planning in the government of President Víctor Paz Estenssoro) to cut hyperinflation from an estimated 25,000% to a single digit within a period of 6 weeks. More broadly, he is credited with having engineered the restructuring of the Bolivian state and the dismantling the state-capitalist model that had prevailed in the country since the 1952 Revolution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Gonz%C3%A1lo_S%C3%A1nchez_de_Lozada-Agencia_BrasilAntonio_Cruz.jpg/220px-Gonz%C3%A1lo_S%C3%A1nchez_de_Lozada-Agencia_BrasilAntonio_Cruz.jpg
