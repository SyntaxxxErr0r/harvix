15.11	Brownian_tree	Brownian tree	A Brownian tree, whose name is derived from Robert Brown via Brownian motion, is a form of computer art that was briefly popular in the 1990s, when home computers started to have sufficient power to simulate Brownian motion. Brownian trees are mathematical models of dendritic structures associated with the physical process known as diffusion-limited aggregation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Brownian_tree_vertical_large.png/250px-Brownian_tree_vertical_large.png
