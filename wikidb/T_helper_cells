10.13	T_helper_cells	T helper cell	T helper cells are a sub-group of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, that play an important role in the immune system, particularly in the adaptive immune system. These cells have no cytotoxic or phagocytic activity; they cannot kill infected host cells or pathogens. Rather, they help other immune cellsâ€”they activate and direct other immune cells. They are essential in B cell antibody class switching, in the activation and growth of cytotoxic T cells, and in maximizing bactericidal activity of phagocytes such as macrophages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Lymphocyte_activation.png/400px-Lymphocyte_activation.png
