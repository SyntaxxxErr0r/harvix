Its wings feature an easily recognizable orange and black pattern, with a wingspan of . (The Viceroy butterfly has a similar size, color, and pattern, but can be distinguished by an extra black stripe across the hind wing.)

Males are also slightly larger.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Monarch_In_May.jpg/250px-Monarch_In_May.jpg
