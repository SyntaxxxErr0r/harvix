81.0	Dead_zone_(ecology)	Dead zone (ecology)	Dead zones are hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas in the world's oceans, the observed incidences of which have been increasing since oceanographers began noting them in the 1970s. These occur near inhabited coastlines, where aquatic life is most concentrated. (The vast middle portions of the oceans, which naturally have little life, are not considered "dead zones".) The term can also be applied to the identical phenomenon in large lakes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Aquatic_Dead_Zones.jpg/400px-Aquatic_Dead_Zones.jpg
