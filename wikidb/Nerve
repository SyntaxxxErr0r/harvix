62.9	Nerve	Nerve	A nerve, is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (the long, slender projections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons. In the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as tracts. Neurons are sometimes called nerve cells, though this term is potentially misleading since many neurons do not form nerves, and nerves also include non-neuronal Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Nerves_of_the_left_upper_extremity.gif/250px-Nerves_of_the_left_upper_extremity.gif
