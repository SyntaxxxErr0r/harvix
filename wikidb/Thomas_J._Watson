152.6	Thomas_J._Watson	Thomas J. Watson	Thomas John Watson, Sr. (February 17, 1874 â€“ June 19, 1956) was the chairman and CEO of International Business Machines (IBM), who oversaw that company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM's distinctive management style and corporate culture, and turned the company into a highly-effective selling organization, based largely around punched card tabulating machines. A leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Thomas_J_Watson_Sr.jpg/200px-Thomas_J_Watson_Sr.jpg
