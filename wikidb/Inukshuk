These structures are found from Alaska to Greenland. This region, above the Arctic Circle, is dominated by the tundra biome and has areas with few natural landmarks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Inukshuk_Sunset_Kuujjuaraapik_January.jpg/177px-Inukshuk_Sunset_Kuujjuaraapik_January.jpg
