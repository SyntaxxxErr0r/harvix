55.9	Polyrhythm	Polyrhythm	Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter. The rhythmic conflict may be the basis of an entire piece of music , or a momentary disruption. Polyrhythms can be distinguished from irrational rhythms, which can occur within the context of a single part; polyrhythms require at least two rhythms to be played concurrently, one of which is typically an irrational rhythm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Polyrhythm.png/350px-Polyrhythm.png
