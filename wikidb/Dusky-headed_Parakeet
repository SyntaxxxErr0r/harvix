2.10	Dusky-headed_Parakeet	Dusky-headed Parakeet	The Dusky-headed Parakeet , also known as the or Weddell's Conure or Dusky-headed Conure in aviculture, is a species of parrot found in wooded habitats in the western Amazon Basin. It prefers semi-open habitats such as v√°rzea, forest edge and forest remnants, but can also be found in coffee plantations. It is generally common and its habitat preference makes it less vulnerable than many other Amazonian species. Consequently, it is considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Aratinga_weddellii_-Beale_Park%2C_Reading%2C_Berkshire%2C_England-8a-4c.jpg/300px-Aratinga_weddellii_-Beale_Park%2C_Reading%2C_Berkshire%2C_England-8a-4c.jpg
