70.8	Resistor	Resistor	A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. The current through a resistor is in direct proportion to the voltage across the resistor's terminals. Thus, the ratio of the voltage applied across a resistor's terminals to the intensity of current through the circuit is called resistance. This relation is represented by Ohm's law:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Resistor.jpg/200px-Resistor.jpg
