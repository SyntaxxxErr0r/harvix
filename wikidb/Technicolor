70.7	Technicolor	Technicolor	Technicolor is a color motion picture process invented in 1916 and improved over several decades. It was the second major process, after Britain's Kinemacolor, and the most widely used color process in Hollywood from 1922 to 1952. Technicolor became known and celebrated for its saturated levels of color, and was used most commonly for filming musicals such as The Wizard of Oz and Singin' in the Rain, costume pictures such as The Adventures of Robin Hood and Joan of Arc, and animated films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Fantasia. However, it was also used for less spectacular dramas and comedies, and sometimes even a Film noir such as Leave Her to Heaven or Niagara was filmed in Technicolor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Spirit_43_-_Average_Donald_Duck_Title_card_-_t%C3%ADtol.JPG/300px-Spirit_43_-_Average_Donald_Duck_Title_card_-_t%C3%ADtol.JPG
