4.00	Berkeley_Branch_Railroad	Berkeley Branch Railroad	The Berkeley Branch Railroad was a 3.84 miles (6.18 km) long branch line of the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) from a junction in what later became Emeryville called "Shellmound" to what soon became downtown Berkeley, adjacent to the new University of California campus. The line opened on August 16, 1876. The initial terminal point was at Shattuck and University Avenues in Berkeley. In 1878, the line was extended north along Shattuck to Vine ("Berryman's Station") with the original terminus then becoming Berkeley Station. The line connected at Shellmound with trains headed to the Oakland Pier and ferries to San Francisco. Beginning on January 22, 1882, Berkeley Branch trains proceeded directly to the pier.
