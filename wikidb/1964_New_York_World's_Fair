70.4	1964_New_York_World's_Fair	1964 New York World's Fair	The 1964/1965 New York World's Fair was the third major world's fair to be held in New York City. Hailing itself as a "universal and international" exposition, the fair's theme was "Peace Through Understanding," dedicated to "Man's Achievement on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe"; although American corporations dominated the exposition as exhibitors. The theme was symbolized by a 12-story high, stainless-steel model of the earth called the Unisphere. The fair ran for two six-month seasons, April 22–October 18, 1964 and April 21–October 17, 1965. Admission price for adults (13 and older) was $2.00 in 1964 but $2.50 in 1965, and $1.00 for children (2–12) both years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/New_York_World%27s_Fair_August_1964.jpeg/450px-New_York_World%27s_Fair_August_1964.jpeg
