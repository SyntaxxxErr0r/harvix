89.5	Easter_Bunny	Easter Bunny	The Easter Bunny or Easter Rabbit (sometimes Spring Bunny in the U.S.) is a character depicted as a rabbit bringing Easter eggs, who sometimes is depicted with clothes. In legend, the creature brings baskets filled with colored eggs, candy and sometimes also toys to the homes of children, and as such shows similarities to Father Christmas, as they both bring gifts to children on the night before their respective holiday. It was first mentioned in Georg Franck von Frankenau's De ovis paschalibus (About Easter Eggs) referring to an Alsace tradition of an Easter Hare bringing Easter Eggs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Easter_Bunny_Postcard_1907.jpg/220px-Easter_Bunny_Postcard_1907.jpg
