75.3	Sapphire	Sapphire	Sapphire is a gemstone variety of the mineral corundum, an aluminium oxide (Î±-Al2O3). Trace amounts of other elements such as iron, titanium, or chromium can give corundum blue, yellow, pink, purple, orange, or greenish color. Chromium impurities in corundum yield a red tint, and the resultant gemstone is called a ruby.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Logan_Sapphire_SI.jpg/100px-Logan_Sapphire_SI.jpg
