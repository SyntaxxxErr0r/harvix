6.10	Sopwith_Tabloid	Sopwith Tabloid	The Sopwith Tabloid and Schneider were British biplanes, originally designed as sports aircraft and later adapted for military use. They were among the first types to be built by the Sopwith Aviation Company. The "Tabloid", so named because of its small size, caused a sensation when it first appeared, its performance easily surpassing the existing monoplanes of the day. A floatplane variant was prepared and entered for the 1914 Schneider Trophy race. Piloted by Howard Pixton this aircraft comfortably won the competition, the floatplane variant consequently becoming known as the Sopwith Schneider. Production orders for both types were placed by the military, and although the Tabloid only saw limited service in the early years of the war some Schneiders were still in service at the end of the war in 1918.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Sopwith_Schneider.jpg/300px-Sopwith_Schneider.jpg
