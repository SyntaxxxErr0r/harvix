66.7	Oil_platform	Oil platform	An oil platform, also referred to as an offshore platform or, somewhat incorrectly, oil rig, is a large structure with facilities to drill wells, to extract and process oil and natural gas, and to temporarily store product until it can be brought to shore for refining and marketing. In many cases, the platform contains facilities to house the workforce as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Oil_platform_P-51_%28Brazil%29.jpg/400px-Oil_platform_P-51_%28Brazil%29.jpg
