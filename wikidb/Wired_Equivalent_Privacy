185.9	Wired_Equivalent_Privacy	Wired Equivalent Privacy	Standard 64-bit WEP uses a 40 bit key (also known as WEP-40), which is concatenated with a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) to form the RC4 key. At the time that the original WEP standard was drafted, the U.S. Government's export restrictions on cryptographic technology limited the key size. Once the restrictions were lifted, manufacturers of access points implemented an extended 128-bit WEP protocol using a 104-bit key size (WEP-104).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Wep-crypt-alt.svg/305px-Wep-crypt-alt.svg.png
