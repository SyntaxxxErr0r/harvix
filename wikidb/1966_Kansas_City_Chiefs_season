Instead of finishing the season with the AFL Championship win, the Chiefs were invited to play in the inaugural AFL-NFL World Championship Game, later known as the Super Bowl, against the NFL's Green Bay Packers. After a strong first half in the game, the Chiefs lost momentum and the Packers won 35â€“10.
