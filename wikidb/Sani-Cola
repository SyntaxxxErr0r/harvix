1.00	Sani-Cola	List of The Adventures of Tintin characters	The supporting characters Hergé created for his series The Adventures of Tintin have been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with a strength of character and depth of personality which has been compared with that of the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. It has been speculated that the occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. The major supporting cast was developed during this period.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Adventures_of_Tintin_Cast.png/250px-Adventures_of_Tintin_Cast.png
