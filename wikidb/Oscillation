62.1	Oscillation	Oscillation	Oscillation is the repetitive variation, typically in time, of some measure about a central value (often a point of equilibrium) or between two or more different states. Familiar examples include a swinging pendulum and AC power. The term vibration is sometimes used more narrowly to mean a mechanical oscillation but sometimes is used to be synonymous with "oscillation". Oscillations occur not only in physical systems but also in biological systems and in human society.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Simple_harmonic_oscillator.gif
