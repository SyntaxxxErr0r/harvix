Marshall and the mill making team at Sutter's Mill, and for establishing Sutter's Fort in the area that would eventually become Sacramento, the state's capital. Although famous throughout California for his association with the Gold Rush, Sutter died almost poor, having seen his business ventures fail while those of his elder son, John Augustus Sutter, Jr., were more successful.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/John_Augustus_Sutter_c1850.jpg/200px-John_Augustus_Sutter_c1850.jpg
