3.60	Tom%C3%A1s_Rivera	Tomás Rivera	Tomás Rivera (December 22, 1935 – May 16, 1984) was a Chicano author, poet, and educator. He was born in Texas to migrant farm workers, and worked in the fields as a young boy. However, he achieved social mobility through education—earning a degree at Southwest Texas State University (now known as Texas State University), and later a PhD at the University of Oklahoma—and came to believe strongly in the virtues of education for Mexican-Americans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Tom%C3%A1s_Rivera.jpg
