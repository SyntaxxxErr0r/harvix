238.5	Luddite	Luddite	The Luddites were a social movement of 19th-century English textile artisans who protested – often by destroying mechanized looms – against the changes produced by the Industrial Revolution, which they felt were leaving them without work and changing their way of life. The movement was named after General Ned Ludd or King Ludd, a mythical figure who, like Robin Hood, was reputed to live in Sherwood Forest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Luddite.jpg/170px-Luddite.jpg
