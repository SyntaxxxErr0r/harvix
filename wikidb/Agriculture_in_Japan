2.00	Agriculture_in_Japan	Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan	Agriculture, forestry, and fishing form the primary sector of industry of the Japanese economy, together with the Japanese mining industry, but together they account for only 1.3% of gross national product. Only 15% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation, but the agricultural economy is highly subsidized and protected. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing dominated the Japanese economy until the 1940s, but thereafter declined into relative unimportance Japanese agriculture before WWII). In the late 19th century (Meiji period), these sectors had accounted for more than 80 % of employment. Employment in agriculture declined in the prewar period, but the sector was still the largest employer (about 50 % of the work force) by the end of World War II. It was further declined to 23.5 % in 1965, 11.9 % in 1977, and to 7.2 % in 1988. The importance of agriculture in the national economy later continued its rapid decline, with the share of net agricultural production in GNP finally reduced between 1975 and 1989 from 4.1 to 3 % In the late 1980s, 85.5 % of Japan's farmers were also engaged in occupations outside of farming, and most of these part-time farmers earned most of their income from nonfarming activities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/TawaramotoRiceField.png/250px-TawaramotoRiceField.png
