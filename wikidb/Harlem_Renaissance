83.6	Harlem_Renaissance	Harlem Renaissance	The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural movement that spanned the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the "New Negro Movement", named after the 1925 anthology by Alain Locke. Though it was centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/New_Negro_Movement.gif/300px-New_Negro_Movement.gif
