49.53	All_the_world's_a_stage	All the world's a stage	"All the world's a stage" is the phrase that begins a monologue from William Shakespeare's As You Like It, spoken by the melancholy Jaques in Act II Scene VII. The speech compares the world to a stage and life to a play, and catalogues the seven stages of a man's life, sometimes referred to as the seven ages of man: infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, justice, pantaloon, and second childhood, "sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything". It is one of Shakespeare's most frequently-quoted passages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Seven_ages_of_man.jpg/220px-Seven_ages_of_man.jpg
