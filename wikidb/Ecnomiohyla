2.00	Ecnomiohyla	Ecnomiohyla	Ecnomiohyla, commonly known as fringe-limbed treefrogs, is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. This genus was erected in 2005 following a major revision of Hylidae. The ten original species in this genus (E. rabborum and E. sukia were a later discoveries) were previously placed in the genus Hyla. The generic name Ecnomiohyla comes from Greek ecnomios ("marvelous" or "unusual") and Hylas, the companion of Hercules.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Ecnomiohyla_miliaria.jpg/220px-Ecnomiohyla_miliaria.jpg
