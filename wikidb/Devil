132.1	Devil	Devil	The Devil (from Greek: διάβολος or diábolos = 'slanderer' or 'accuser') is believed in many religions and cultures to be a powerful, supernatural entity that is the personification of evil and the enemy of God and humankind. The nature of the role varies greatly. It ranges from being an effective opposite force to the creator god at one extreme, where both are locked in an eons long holy war for human souls on what may seem even terms (to the point of dualistic ditheism/bitheism), to being just a comical figure of fun or even an abstract aspect of the individual human condition at the other.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Codex_Gigas_devil.jpg/200px-Codex_Gigas_devil.jpg
