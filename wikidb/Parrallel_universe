1.00	Parrallel_universe	Many-worlds interpretation	The many-worlds interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts the objective reality of the universal wavefunction, but denies the actuality of wavefunction collapse. Many-worlds implies that all possible alternative histories and futures are real, each representing an actual "world" (or "universe"). It is also referred to as MWI, the relative state formulation, the Everett interpretation, the theory of the universal wavefunction, many-universes interpretation, or just many-worlds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/MWI_Schrodingers_cat.png/350px-MWI_Schrodingers_cat.png
