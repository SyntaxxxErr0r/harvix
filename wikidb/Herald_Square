27.54	Herald_Square	Herald Square	Herald Square is formed by the intersection of Broadway, Sixth Avenue (officially named Avenue of the Americas) and 34th Street in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. Named for the New York Herald, a now-defunct newspaper formerly headquartered there, it also gives its name to the surrounding area. The intersection is a typical Manhattan bow-tie square that consists of two named sections: Herald Square to the north (uptown) and Greeley Square to the south (downtown). Most non-New Yorkers know of it from the song Give My Regards to Broadway where the singer asks "remember me to Herald Square", or from the fact that Herald Square is the terminus for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, broadcast nationally each year by NBC-TV.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Herald_Square_in_Manhattan.jpg/287px-Herald_Square_in_Manhattan.jpg
