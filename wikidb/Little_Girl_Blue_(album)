6.00	Little_Girl_Blue_(album)	Little Girl Blue (album)	Little Girl Blue is the debut album by Jazz singer/pianist/songwriter Nina Simone (1933â€“2003) for Bethlehem Records. It was also released as Jazz As Played in an Exclusive Side Street Club. Nina was in her mid-20s at the time of this album, and still aspiring to be a classical concert pianist. She immediately sold the rights for the songs on this album to Bethlehem for $3,000. In the end, this cost her royalty profits of more than a million dollars. Simone was dissatisfied by the lack of effort the record company took in promoting her, and after this album she went over for a long relationship with Colpix Records. The album Nina Simone and Her Friends was released after she left, and comprised songs that were left over from the Little Girl Blue recording session.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/53/Ninasimonelittlegirlblue.jpg
