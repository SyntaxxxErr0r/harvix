78.5	Id,_ego,_and_super-ego	Id, ego and super-ego	Id, ego and super-ego are the three parts of the psychic apparatus defined in Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described. According to this model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the ego is the organized, realistic part; and the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Freud_Sofa.JPG/170px-Freud_Sofa.JPG
