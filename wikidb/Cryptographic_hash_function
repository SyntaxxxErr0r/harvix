386.9	Cryptographic_hash_function	Cryptographic hash function	A cryptographic hash function is a hash function that can be defined as a deterministic procedure that takes an arbitrary block of data and returns a fixed-size bit string, the hash value, such that an accidental or intentional change to the data will change the hash value. The data to be encoded is often called the "message," and the hash value is sometimes called the message digest or simply digest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Cryptographic_Hash_Function.svg/375px-Cryptographic_Hash_Function.svg.png
