7.31	Nipple_clamp	Nipple clamp	A nipple clamp is a clamp that can be applied to the nipples of either men or women. It is a sex toy which can be attached to the nipples to create pain by restricting blood flow from erect nipples by applying pressure to them. Some people derive erotic pleasure from seeing nipple clamps applied. They are used in some BDSM activities, such as tit torture. The use of nipple clamps is often portrayed in the media as deviant or kinky sexual behavior.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Nipple_Clamps_in_Use.png/220px-Nipple_Clamps_in_Use.png
