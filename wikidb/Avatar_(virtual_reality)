112.4	Avatar_(virtual_reality)	Avatar (computing)	The use of the term avatar for the on-screen representation of the user was coined in 1985 by Chip Morningstar and Joseph Romero in designing LucasFilm's online role-playing game Habitat. The computer game Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar was released in 1985, but does not use the word in this sense, only in its original religious sense; the player's in-game final objective is to become an "Avatar". Later games in the Ultima series use the term in the same sense as Habitat and introduce Habitat-style customization of avatars. Another early use of the term was in the pen and paper role-playing game Shadowrun (1989).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Automated_online_assistant.png/170px-Automated_online_assistant.png
