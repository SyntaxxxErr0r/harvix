51.6	Tevatron	Tevatron	The Tevatron is a circular particle accelerator in the United States, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (also known as Fermilab), just east of Batavia, Illinois, and is the second highest energy particle collider in the world after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The Tevatron is a synchrotron that accelerates protons and antiprotons in a 6.28 km (3.90 mi) ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million ($280 million today) and significant upgrade investments were made in 1983-2011. (The 'Energy Doubler', as it was known then, produced its first accelerated beam — 512 GeV — on July 3, 1983.) The Main Injector was the most substantial addition, built over five years from 1994 at a cost of $290 million ($677 million today).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Fermilab.jpg/300px-Fermilab.jpg
