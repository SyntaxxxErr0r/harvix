3.10	Icelandic_car_number_plates	Vehicle registration plates of Iceland	Vehicle registration plates in Iceland are issued by the The road traffic directorate and are made in the state penitentiary. The plates are made of aluminum with reflective base and embossed characters. The current registration system uses three letters and two digits or two letters and three digits. The plates are issued randomly, they are not issued sequentially and they do not have any geographic coding. There are no special letters or number series for special vehicle types (this may vary depending on type of plates, see chart below.) All plates have validation sticker that indicates the year the vehicle is due for safety inspection. The current registration system was introduced on 1 January 1989. The system replaced the old decentralized system that had been in use for decades. From 1989-2007 the system consisted of two letters and three digits. In 2007 the system ran out of combinations and the third character was changed to letter. Vehicles in Iceland keep the same registration number for life. If a vehicle is e.g. changed to commercial vehicle it gets commercial plates but they have the same registration number. Early 2004 a country identifier (IS) and the Icelandic flag was added on the left side of all standard plates. The country identifier is mandatory and all plates issued Between 1989 and 2004 are required to get a national identifier sticker so they look like the new plates. although this law is not widely enforced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Standard_IS_plate.jpg/250px-Standard_IS_plate.jpg
