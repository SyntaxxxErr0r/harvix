65.3	Java_applet	Java applet	A Java applet is an applet delivered to users in the form of Java bytecode. Java applets can run in a Web browser using a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), or in Sun's AppletViewer, a stand-alone tool for testing applets. Java applets were introduced in the first version of the Java language in 1995, and are written in programming languages that compile to Java bytecode, usually in Java, but also in other languages such as Jython, JRuby, or Eiffel (via SmartEiffel).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Java_applet.png/220px-Java_applet.png
