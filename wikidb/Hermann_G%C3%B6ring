89.7	Hermann_G%C3%B6ring	Hermann Göring	In 1935 Göring was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe (air force), a position he held until the final days of World War II. By 1940 Göring was at the peak of his power and influence. Adolf Hitler had promoted him to the rank of Reichsmarschall, making Göring senior to all other Wehrmacht commanders, and in 1941 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. By 1942, with the German war effort stumbling on both fronts, Göring's standing with Hitler was very greatly reduced. Göring largely withdrew from the military and political scene to enjoy the pleasures of life as a wealthy and powerful man. After World War II, Göring was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg Trials. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by cyanide ingestion the night before the sentence was to be carried out.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Hermann_Goering_-_Nuremberg2.jpg/220px-Hermann_Goering_-_Nuremberg2.jpg
