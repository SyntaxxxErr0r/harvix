101.3	Fixing_Broken_Windows	Broken windows theory	The broken windows theory is a criminological theory of the norm setting and signaling effect of urban disorder and vandalism on additional crime and anti-social behavior. The theory states that monitoring and maintaining urban environments in a well-ordered condition may stop further vandalism and escalation into more serious crime.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Pruitt-Igoe-vandalized-windows.jpg/300px-Pruitt-Igoe-vandalized-windows.jpg
