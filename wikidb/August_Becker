3.10	August_Becker	August Becker	August Becker (17 August 1900, Staufenberg, Hesse - 31 December 1967) was during the Nazi regime in Germany (1933â€“1945) an SS lieutenant colonel and chemist in the Central Reich Security Office (RSHA). He helped design the vans with a gas chamber built into the back compartment used in early Nazi mass murder of disabled people, political dissidents, Jews, and other "racial enemies," including Action T4 as well as the Einsatzgruppen (mobile Nazi death squads) in the Nazi-occupied portions of the Soviet Union. Generally his role was to provide important technical support, but on at least one occasion he personally gassed about 20 people.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-15663%2C_Geistig_Kranker.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-15663%2C_Geistig_Kranker.jpg
