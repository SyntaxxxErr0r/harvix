3.00	Emily_J._Hilscher	Virginia Tech massacre	The Virginia Tech massacre was a school shooting that took place on April 16, 2007, on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, United States. In two separate attacks, approximately two hours apart, the perpetrator, Seung-Hui Cho, killed 32 people and wounded 25 others before committing suicide. The massacre is the deadliest shooting incident by a single gunman in U.S. history. It was also the worst act of mass murder on college students since Syracuse University lost 36 students in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. It is also the second-deadliest act of mass murder at a school campus, behind the Bath School bombing of 1927.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Virginia_Tech_massacre_candlelight_vigil_Burruss.jpg/220px-Virginia_Tech_massacre_candlelight_vigil_Burruss.jpg
