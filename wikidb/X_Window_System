144.0	X_Window_System	X Window System	The X window system (commonly X Window System or X11, based on its current major version being 11) is a computer software system and network protocol that provides a basis for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and rich input device capability for networked computers. It creates a hardware abstraction layer where software is written to use a generalized set of commands, allowing for device independence and reuse of programs on any computer that implements X.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/X-Window-System.png/300px-X-Window-System.png
