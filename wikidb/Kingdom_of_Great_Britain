109.4	Kingdom_of_Great_Britain	Kingdom of Great Britain	The former Kingdom of Great Britain, also described occasionally as the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain', was a sovereign state in northwest Europe, that existed from 1707 to 1801. It came into being on 1 May 1707, with the political union of the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England (which included Wales). With the 1706 Treaty of Union (ratified by the Acts of Union 1707), it was agreed to create a single, united kingdom, encompassing the whole of the island of Great Britain and its minor outlying islands, excluding Ireland, which remained a separate realm under the newly created British crown. A single parliament and government, based at Westminster, controlled the new kingdom. The former kingdoms had already shared the same monarch since James VI, King of Scots became King of England in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a "Union of the Crowns".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg/125px-Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg.png
