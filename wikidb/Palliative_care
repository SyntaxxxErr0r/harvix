73.4	Palliative_care	Palliative care	Medications used for palliative patients are used differently than standard medications, based on established practices with varying degrees of evidence. Examples include the use of antipsychotic medications to treat nausea, anticonvulsants to treat pain, and morphine to treat dyspnea. Routes of administration may differ from acute or chronic care, as many patients lose the ability to swallow. A common alternative route of administration is subcutaneous, as it is less traumatic and less difficult to maintain than intravenous medications. Other routes of administration include sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular and transdermal. Medications are often managed at home by family or nursing support.
