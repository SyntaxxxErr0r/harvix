98.6	Hannah_Arendt	Hannah Arendt	Hannah Arendt (October 14, 1906 â€“ December 4, 1975) was a German American political theorist. She has often been described as a philosopher, although she refused that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular." She described herself instead as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world". Arendt's work deals with the nature of power, and the subjects of politics, authority, and totalitarianism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Hannah_Arendt.jpg/220px-Hannah_Arendt.jpg
