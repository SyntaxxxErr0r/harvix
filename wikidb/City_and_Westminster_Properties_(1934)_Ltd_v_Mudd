1.00	City_and_Westminster_Properties_(1934)_Ltd_v_Mudd	City and Westminster Properties (1934) Ltd v Mudd	City and Westminster Properties (1934) Ltd v Mudd Ch 129 is an English contract law case, regarding the parol evidence rule. It illustrates one of the large exceptions, that a written document is not deemed to be exhaustive of the parties intentions when there is clear evidence of a collateral contract. It shows that even evidence from outside a written agreement may contradict evidence inside it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/City_v_Mudd_site.jpg/180px-City_v_Mudd_site.jpg
