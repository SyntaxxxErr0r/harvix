1.00	Cadmium_telluride_solar_cell	Cadmium telluride photovoltaics	Cadmium telluride (CdTe) photovoltaics describes a photovoltaic (PV) technology that is based on the use of cadmium telluride thin film, a semiconductor layer designed to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity. Cadmium telluride PV is the first and only thin film photovoltaic technology to surpass crystalline silicon PV in cheapness for a significant portion of the PV market, namely in multi-kilowatt systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/NREL_Array.jpg/220px-NREL_Array.jpg
