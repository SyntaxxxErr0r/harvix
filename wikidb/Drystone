3.01	Drystone	Dry stone	Dry stone is a building method by which structures are constructed from stones without any mortar to bind them together. Dry stone structures are stable because of their unique construction method, which is characterized by the presence of a load-bearing facade of carefully selected interlocking stones. Dry stone technology is best known in the context of wall construction, but dry stone artwork, buildings, bridges, and other structures also exist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Muchallscastledrystone.jpg/250px-Muchallscastledrystone.jpg
