55.5	Copyrights	Copyright	Copyright is a legal concept, enacted by most governments, giving the creator of an original work exclusive rights to it, usually for a limited time. Generally, it is "the right to copy", but also gives the copyright holder the right to be credited for the work, to determine who may adapt the work to other forms, who may perform the work, who may financially benefit from it, and other related rights. It is an intellectual property form (like the patent, the trademark, and the trade secret) applicable to any expressible form of an idea or information that is substantive and discrete.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Statute_of_anne.jpg/250px-Statute_of_anne.jpg
