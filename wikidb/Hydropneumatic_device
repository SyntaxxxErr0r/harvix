2.00	Hydropneumatic_device	Hydropneumatic device	North American, European, and other languages refer to hydropneumatic devices such as a hydropneumatic accumulator or pulsation damper using very different words. In many cases this can cause a great deal of word usage confusion. This article includes information about devices that prevent, and do not either absorb, alleviate, arrest, attenuate, nor suppress a shock that exists (devices which prevent the creation of a shock wave at an otherwise higher level). The words frequently used for devices such as pulsation dampeners, hydropneumatic accumulators, water hammer preventers, water hammer arrestors, and others, are included.
