F. Petrov in 1942 and 1943, based on the carriage of the 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30) and using the barrel of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10). The powerful and mobile D-1, with its wide range of ammunition, significantly increased the firepower and breakthrough abilities of Red Army tank and motor rifle formations. Several hundred D-1s were manufactured before the end of World War II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/D1_howitzer_kiev.jpg/300px-D1_howitzer_kiev.jpg
