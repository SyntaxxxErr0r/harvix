6.00	Federazione_Anarchica_Italiana	Federazione Anarchica Italiana	In the early seventies a platformist tendency emerged within the Italian Anarchist Federation which argued for more strategic coherence and social insertion in the workers movement while rejecting the syntesist "Associative Pact" of Malatesta which the FAI adhered to. These groups started organizing themselves outside the FAI in organizations such as O.R.A. from Liguria which organized a Congress attended by 250 delegates of grupos from 60 locations. In 1986, the Congress of ORA/UCAT adopted the name Federation of Anarchist Communists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Facciamo_breccia_2008_by_Stefano_Bolognini18.JPG/200px-Facciamo_breccia_2008_by_Stefano_Bolognini18.JPG
