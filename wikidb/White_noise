168.0	White_noise	White noise	White noise is a random signal (or process) with a flat power spectral density. In other words, the signal contains equal power within a fixed bandwidth at any center frequency. White noise draws its name from white light in which the power spectral density of the light is distributed over the visible band in such a way that the eye's three color receptors are approximately equally stimulated. In statistical sense, a time series rt is characterized as having weak white noise if {rt} is a sequence of serially uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and finite variance. Strong white noise also has the quality of being independent and identically distributed, which implies no autocorrelation. In particular, if rt is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation Ïƒ , the series is called a Gaussian white noise.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/White-noise.png/220px-White-noise.png
