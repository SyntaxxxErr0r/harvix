1.00	Cake-cutting_problem	Fair division	Fair division, also known as the cake-cutting problem, is the problem of dividing a resource in such a way that all recipients believe that they have received a fair amount. The problem is easier when recipients have different measures of value of the parts of the resource: in the "cake cutting" version, one recipient may like marzipan, another prefers cherries, and so onâ€”then, and only then, the n recipients may get even more than what would be one n-th of the value of the "cake" for each of them. On the other hand, the presence of different measures opens a vast potential for many challenging questions and directions of further research.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Berlin_Blockade-map.svg/200px-Berlin_Blockade-map.svg.png
