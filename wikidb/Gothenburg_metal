2.00	Gothenburg_metal	Melodic death metal	Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath or MDM) is a heavy metal music style that combines elements from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) with elements of death metal. The style was developed during the early and mid-1990s, primarily in England and Scandinavia. Scandinavia in particular did much to popularize the style, which soon centered in Gothenburg, Sweden, and spawned a local music scene called Gothenburg metal. This "Gothenburg" style subsequently inspired many bands in the United States, which led to a flourishing movement in that country.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Carcass_31.jpg/220px-Carcass_31.jpg
