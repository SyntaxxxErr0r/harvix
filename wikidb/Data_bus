4.34	Data_bus	System bus	A system bus is a single computer bus that connects the major components of a computer system. The technique was developed to reduce costs and improve modularity. It combines the functions of a data bus to carry information, an address bus to determine where it should be sent, and a control bus to determine its operation. Although popular in the 1970s and 1980s, modern computers use a variety of separate buses adapted to more specific needs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Computer_system_bus.svg/350px-Computer_system_bus.svg.png
