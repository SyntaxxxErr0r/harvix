63.1	Nun	Nun	A nun is a woman who has taken vows committing her life to her religion. She may be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live her life in prayer and contemplation in a monastery or convent. The term "nun" is applicable to Catholics – both eastern and western traditions – Orthodox Christians, Anglicans, Lutherans, Jains, Buddhists, Taoists, and Hindus. While in common usage the terms nun and sister are often used interchangeably, in some cases they are differentiated, a nun being a religious woman who lives a contemplative cloistered life of prayer and meditation for the salvation of others, while a sister, in Christian Catholic order like Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity, lives an active vocation of prayer and service, often to the needy, sick, poor, and uneducated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Nonne_im_Kreuzgang%2C_1930.jpg/250px-Nonne_im_Kreuzgang%2C_1930.jpg
