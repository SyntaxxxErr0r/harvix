4.00	Uni-	Number prefix	For Latinate 21, 22, etc., the pattern for the teens is followed: unvigint-, duovigint-, etc. For higher numbers, the reverse order may be found: 36 trigintisex-. For Greek, the word kai ('and') is used: icosikaihena-, icosikaidi-, pentacontakaipenta-, etc. In these and in the tens, the kai is frequently omitted, though not in triskaidekaphobia. (The inconsistency of triskaidekaphobia with the table above is explained by the fact that the Greek letter kappa can be transliterated either "c" or "k".) Sesqui- is used in Latin combinations for 1½ (sesquicentennial) and quasqui- for 1¼; multi- and poly- are used in Latin and Greek combinations for 'many' (multilateral, polygon). In chemical nomenclature, 11 is generally mixed Latin-Greek undec-, and the 20s are based on -cos-, for example tricos- for 23.
