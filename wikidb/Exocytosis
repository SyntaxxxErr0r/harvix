18.82	Exocytosis	Exocytosis	Exocytosis (from Greek ἔξω "out" and English cyto- "cell" from Gk. κύτος "receptacle") is the durable process by which a cell directs the contents of secretory vesicles out of the cell membrane. These membrane-bound vesicles contain soluble proteins to be secreted to the extracellular environment, as well as membrane proteins and lipids that are sent to become components of the cell membrane.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Synapse_diag1.svg/300px-Synapse_diag1.svg.png
