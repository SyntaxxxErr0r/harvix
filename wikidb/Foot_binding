64.1	Foot_binding	Foot binding	Foot binding (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; Mandarin Pinyin: chánzú; Jyutping: gwo2 goek3; literally "bound feet" or Chinese: ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: pa̍k-kha) was the custom of binding the feet of young girls painfully tight to prevent further growth. The practice likely originated among court dancers in the early Song dynasty, but spread to upper class families and eventually became common among all classes. The tiny narrow feet were considered beautiful and to make a woman's movements more feminine and dainty. Although reformers challenged the practice, it was not until the early 20th century that footbinding began dying out, partly from changing social conditions and partly as a result of anti-footbinding campaigns. Foot-binding resulted in lifelong disabilities for most of its subjects, and some elderly Chinese women still survive today with disabilities related to their bound feet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Chinese_Ladies_Footbinding_Shoes_QM_r_.jpg/220px-Chinese_Ladies_Footbinding_Shoes_QM_r_.jpg
