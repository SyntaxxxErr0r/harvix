1.00	Sigelgaita_of_Salerno	Sikelgaita	She married Robert in 1058, after Robert divorced his first wife Alberada, due to supposed consanguinity. Her sister Gaitelgrima had earlier married Robert's half-brother Drogo. The divorce from Alberada and the marriage of Sikelgaita were probably part of a strategy of alliance with the remaining Lombard princes, of whom Guaimar was chief. Alberada, for her part, appears to have had no qualms about dissolving her marriage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Roberto_il_Guiscardo_Costantino.jpg/350px-Roberto_il_Guiscardo_Costantino.jpg
