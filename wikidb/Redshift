125.9	Redshift	Redshift	In physics (especially astrophysics), redshift happens when light seen coming from an object that is moving away is proportionally increased in wavelength, or shifted to the red end of the spectrum. More generally, where an observer detects electromagnetic radiation outside the visible spectrum, "redder" amounts to a technical shorthand for "increase in electromagnetic wavelength" â€” which also implies lower frequency and photon energy in accord with, respectively, the wave and quantum theories of light.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/WMAP_2010.png/220px-WMAP_2010.png
