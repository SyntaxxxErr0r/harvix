52.1	Valentina_Tereshkova	Valentina Tereshkova	Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova (Russian: ; born March 6, 1937) is a retired Soviet cosmonaut, and was the first woman in space. She was selected out of more than four hundred applicants, and then out of five finalists, to pilot Vostok 6 on the 16 June, 1963, becoming both the first woman and the first civilian to fly in space, as she was only honorarily inducted into the USSR's Air Force as a condition on joining the Cosmonaut Corps. During her three-day mission, she performed various tests on herself to collect data on the female body's reaction to spaceflight.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/RIAN_archive_612748_Valentina_Tereshkova.jpg/280px-RIAN_archive_612748_Valentina_Tereshkova.jpg
