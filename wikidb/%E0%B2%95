They are used throughout South Asia (including Pakistan and Afghanistan), Southeast Asia, and parts of Central and East Asia, and are descended from the Brāhmī script of the ancient Indian subcontinent. They are used by languages of several language families: Indo-European, Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, Mongolic , Austro-Asiatic, Austronesian, Tai, and possibly influenced Korean (hangul). They were also the source of the dictionary order of Japanese kana.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg/140px-Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg
