55.8	1948_Palestinian_exodus	1948 Palestinian exodus	The 1948 Palestinian exodus, known in Arabic as the Nakba (Arabic: â€Ž, an-Nakbah, lit. "disaster", "catastrophe", or "cataclysm"), occurred when approximately 711,000 to 725,000 Palestinian Arabs left, fled or were expelled from their homes, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the Civil War that preceded it. The exact number of refugees is a matter of dispute. The causes remain the subject of fundamental disagreement between Arabs and Israelis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Palestinian_refugees.jpg/300px-Palestinian_refugees.jpg
