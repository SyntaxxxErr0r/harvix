55.1	Cuisine	Cuisine	Cuisine (from French cuisine, "cooking; culinary art; kitchen"; ultimately from Latin coquere, "to cook") is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions, often associated with a specific culture. Cuisines are often named after the geographic areas or regions that they originate from. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Religious food laws, such as Islamic dietary laws and Jewish dietary laws, can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine. Regional food preparation traditions, customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a particular region.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Floris_Claesz._van_Dyck_001.jpg/180px-Floris_Claesz._van_Dyck_001.jpg
