1.00	Piano_Quartet_No._1_(Faur%C3%A9)	Piano Quartet No. 1 (Fauré)	Gabriel Fauré's Piano Quartet No. 1, in C minor, Op. 15 is one of two chamber works written by him for the conventional piano quartet combination of piano, violin, viola and cello. Despite being in a minor key it is predominantly positive in tone, though with some hints in the slow movement of the emotional turmoil of Fauré's life at the time of the composition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Faur%C3%A9-1875.jpg/220px-Faur%C3%A9-1875.jpg
