59.4	Glycoprotein	Glycoprotein	Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. In proteins that have segments extending extracellularly, the extracellular segments are often glycosylated. Glycoproteins are often important integral membrane proteins, where they play a role in cellâ€“cell interactions. Glycoproteins are also formed in the cytosol, but their functions and the pathways producing these modifications in this compartment are less well understood.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Glicoprotein.svg/220px-Glicoprotein.svg.png
