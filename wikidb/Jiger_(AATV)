2.00	Jiger_(AATV)	Jiger (AATV)	The Jiger was the first All Terain Vehicle (ATV). It was a 6-wheeled amphibious ATV with differential steering via separate throttle control of its dual (left vs right) engines. The first Jigers were built-to-order beginning in 1961 by JGR Gunsport in Toronto and were mass produced by Jiger Corporation beginning in 1965. Production of the Jiger ended in 1968 due to the financial weakness of the company, despite strong demand. Around 3337 Jigers were built.
