62.3	Economic_rent	Economic rent	Economic rent is technical terminology used by economists to define one aspect of the price of goods and services. Generally, it designates the difference between the raw costs of everything needed to produce the goods or service and the price. In the analysis, economic rent is determined for each of the factors of production that are used to produce the good or service. Usually economic rent is due to some exclusivity. For example, for labor, it could be due to celebrity or skill (e.g., higher pay for skilled workers, in a region where there is a scarcity of such skilled workers); for a good, it may be due to the power of a patent; for real estate, it may be due to a favorable location. By contrast, if there is no exclusivity and there is perfect competition, there are no economic rents, as competition drives prices down to their floor. A recipient of economic rent is a rentier.
