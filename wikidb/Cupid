He is often portrayed as the son of the goddess Venus, with a father rarely mentioned. His Greek counterpart is Eros. Cupid is also known in Latin as Amor ("Love"). The Amores (plural) or amorini in the later terminology of art history are the equivalent of the Greek Erotes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Cupido4b.jpg/200px-Cupido4b.jpg
