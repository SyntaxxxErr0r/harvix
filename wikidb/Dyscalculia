54.3	Dyscalculia	Dyscalculia	Dyscalculia (or math disability) is a specific learning disability involving innate difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic. It is akin to dyslexia and includes difficulty in understanding numbers, learning how to manipulate numbers, learning maths facts, and a number of other related symptoms (although there is no exact form of the disability). Math disabilities can also occur as the result of some types of brain injury, in which case the proper term is acalculia, to distinguish it from dyscalculia which is of innate, genetic or developmental origin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Gray726_intraparietal_sulcus.svg/230px-Gray726_intraparietal_sulcus.svg.png
