102.8	Visitor_pattern	Visitor pattern	In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to easily follow the open/closed principle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/VisitorClassDiagram.svg/300px-VisitorClassDiagram.svg.png
