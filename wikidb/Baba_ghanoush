78.0	Baba_ghanoush	Baba ghanoush	Baba ghanoush, baba ganush, baba ghannouj or baba ghannoug is a Levantine dish of eggplant (aubergine) mashed and mixed with virgin olive oil and various seasonings. A popular preparation method is for the eggplant to be baked or broiled over an open flame before peeling, so that the pulp is soft and has a smoky taste. Often, it is eaten as a dip with khubz or pita bread, and is sometimes added to other dishes. It is usually of an earthy light-brown color. It is popular in the Levant (area covering Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria), Kurdistan, and Egypt.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Baba_Ghanoush.jpg/230px-Baba_Ghanoush.jpg
