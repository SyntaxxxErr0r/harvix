58.6	Apollo_Guidance_Computer	Apollo Guidance Computer	The Apollo Guidance Computer was a digital computer produced for the Apollo program that was installed onboard each Apollo Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM). The AGC provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance, navigation, and control of the spacecraft. The AGC had a 16-bit word length, with 15 data bits and one parity bit. Most of the software on the AGC was stored in a special read only memory known as core rope memory, fashioned by weaving wires through magnetic cores, though a small amount of read-write core memory was provided.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Agc_view.jpg/220px-Agc_view.jpg
