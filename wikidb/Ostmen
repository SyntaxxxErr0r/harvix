1.00	Ostmen	Norseâ€“Gaels	The Norse-Gaels originated in Viking colonies of Ireland and Scotland, whose inhabitants became subject to the process of Gaelicisation, whereby starting as early as the ninth century, most intermarried with native Gaels (except for the Norse who settled in Cumbria) and adopted the Gaelic language as well as many other Gaelic customs. Many left their original worship of Norse gods and converted to Christianity, and this contributed to the Gaelicisation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Skuldelev_II.jpg/220px-Skuldelev_II.jpg
