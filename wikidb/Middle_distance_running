6.11	Middle_distance_running	Middle distance running	The 800 m consists of two laps around a standard 400 m track, and has always been an Olympic event. In 1882, American Lon Myers set what was then a world record at 800 m, running it in 1:44.4. It was included in the first women's track programme in 1928, but suspended until 1960 because of shock and the exhaustion it caused the competitors. Without the benefits of modern training, men of the era were, in contrast, expected to run themselves to complete exhaustion during competitions .
