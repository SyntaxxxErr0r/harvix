63.4	Flux_capacitor	DeLorean time machine	The DeLorean time machine is a fictional automobile-based time travel device featured in the Back to the Future trilogy. In the feature film series, Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown builds a time machine from a DeLorean DMC-12 with the intent of gaining insights into history and the future but instead winds up using it to travel across 130 years of Hill Valley history (from 1885 to 2015) undoing the negative effects of time travel. One of the cars used in filming is currently on display in the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Back_to_the_Future_DeLorean_-_Universal_Studios_Florida.jpg/250px-Back_to_the_Future_DeLorean_-_Universal_Studios_Florida.jpg
