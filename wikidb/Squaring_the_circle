55.1	Squaring_the_circle	Squaring the circle	Squaring the circle is a problem proposed by ancient geometers. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge. More abstractly and more precisely, it may be taken to ask whether specified axioms of Euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles entail the existence of such a square.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Squaring_the_circle.svg/250px-Squaring_the_circle.svg.png
