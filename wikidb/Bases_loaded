4.12	Bases_loaded	Bases loaded	In the sport of baseball, the bases are loaded when there is a runner on each base (1st, 2nd, and 3rd). This presents a great scoring opportunity for the batting team, but it also presents an easy double play opportunity for the defense. Causing the bases to become loaded is called loading the bases. A batter is often intentionally walked when there are runners on 2nd and 3rd base to make it easier for the defense to record more than one out.
