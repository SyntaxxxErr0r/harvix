6.00	Mini_4WD	Mini 4WD	A mini 4WD is a 1/32 scale or 1:32-sized AA battery powered plastic model race car without remote control. All 4 rubber-tired wheels are driven, thus "4WD" for 4 wheel drive. Side rollers secure the vehicle against the vertical walls of the un-banked track for steering, providing very fast speeds compared to slot or RC cars. In Japan, Mini 4WD is also known as mini yonku (ミニ四駆) in Japanese. Though mostly popular in Asia, they have also been sold in the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Mini_4WD.JPG/250px-Mini_4WD.JPG
