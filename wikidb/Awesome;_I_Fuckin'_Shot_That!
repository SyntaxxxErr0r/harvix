4.41	Awesome;_I_Fuckin'_Shot_That!	Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!	Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That! (alternate title: Awesome; I... Shot That!) is a 2006 concert film of the Beastie Boys. It was created by giving camcorders to 50 audience members of a sold out concert at Madison Square Garden on October 9, 2004. The audience members were instructed to keep the cameras rolling at all times. For a low budget operation, all cameras were returned to the place of purchase for a refund.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3f/Awesome%3B_I_Fuckin%27_Shot_That%21.jpg/220px-Awesome%3B_I_Fuckin%27_Shot_That%21.jpg
