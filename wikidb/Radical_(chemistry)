79.2	Radical_(chemistry)	Radical (chemistry)	Radicals (often referred to as free radicals) are atoms, molecules, or ions with unpaired electrons or an open shell configuration. Free radicals may have positive, negative, or zero charge. With some exceptions, these unpaired electrons cause radicals to be highly chemically reactive.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Gombergm01.jpg/220px-Gombergm01.jpg
