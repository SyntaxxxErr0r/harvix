6.00	Samuel_Pepys_Cockerell	Samuel Pepys Cockerell	Samuel Pepys Cockerell (1754â€“1827) was an English architect. He was the son of John Cockerell, of Bishop's Hull, Somerset, and the brother of Sir Charles Cockerell, 1st Baronet, for whom he designed the house he is best known for, Sezincote House, Gloucestershire, where the uniquely Orientalizing features inspired the more extravagant fantasy of the Brighton Pavilion. Through their mother they were great-great nephews of the diarist Samuel Pepys.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Samuel_Pepys_Cockerell_by_George_Dance_1793.jpg/220px-Samuel_Pepys_Cockerell_by_George_Dance_1793.jpg
