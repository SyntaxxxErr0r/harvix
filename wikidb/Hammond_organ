71.2	Hammond_organ	Hammond organ	The Hammond organ is an electric organ invented by Laurens Hammond in 1934 and manufactured by the Hammond Organ Company. While the Hammond organ was originally sold to churches as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven pipe organ, in the 1960s and 1970s it became a standard keyboard instrument for jazz, blues, rock, church and gospel music.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Hammond_l100.jpg/300px-Hammond_l100.jpg
