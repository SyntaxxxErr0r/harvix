The marímbula is usually classified as part of the lamellophone family of musical instruments. With its roots in African instruments, marimbula originated in the province of Oriente, Cuba in the 19th century. Eventually it spread throughout the Caribbean the Americas and Africa, from Liberia to the Congo. By the 1930s it had made its way to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, other Caribbean islands, Mexico, and as far away as New York City. The Cubans call it marímbula, and most of the other Caribbean countries have adopted this name or some variant of it: marimba, malimba, manimba, marimbol. The instrument has a number of other names, such as marímbola (Puerto Rico), bass box, calimba (also spelled calymba), rhumba box, Church &amp; Clap, Jazz Jim (Jamaica), and box lamellophone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Marimbula.png/250px-Marimbula.png
