75.0	Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade	Charge of the Light Brigade	The Charge of the Light Brigade was a charge of British cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854 in the Crimean War. The charge was the result of a miscommunication in such a way that the brigade attempted a much more difficult objective than intended by the overall commander Lord Raglan. Blame for the miscommunication has remained controversial, as the original order itself was vague. The charge produced no decisive gains and resulted in very high casualties, and is best remembered as the subject of the poem "The Charge of the Light Brigade" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, whose lines emphasize the valour of the cavalry in carrying out their orders, even "tho' the soldier knew / Some one had blunder'd".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/William_Simpson_-_Charge_of_the_light_cavalry_brigade%2C_25th_Oct._1854%2C_under_Major_General_the_Earl_of_Cardigan.jpg/300px-William_Simpson_-_Charge_of_the_light_cavalry_brigade%2C_25th_Oct._1854%2C_under_Major_General_the_Earl_of_Cardigan.jpg
