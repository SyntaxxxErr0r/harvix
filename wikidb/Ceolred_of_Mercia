2.30	Ceolred_of_Mercia	Ceolred of Mercia	By the end of the 7th century, England was almost entirely divided into kingdoms ruled by the Anglo-Saxons, who had come to Britain two hundred years earlier. The kingdom of Mercia occupied what is now the English Midlands, bordered by Northumbria to the north, East Anglia to the east, and Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, to the south. Essex, the kingdom of the East Saxons, included London and lay between East Anglia and the kingdom of Kent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/British_kingdoms_c_800.png/250px-British_kingdoms_c_800.png
