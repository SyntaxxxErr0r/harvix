1.01	Outrage_(band)	Outrage (band)	Outrage is a thrash metal band formed in Nagoya, Japan in 1982. The band was named after Motörhead's song "Sex &amp; Outrage" from Iron Fist. They were influenced by NWOBHM bands in their early years. Outrage released their debut album in 1988. In 1999 singer Naoki left the band, they continued as a three piece with Yosuke and Yoshihiro sharing vocals. During this period their music changed to a more hard rock sound, but still had a metal edge to it. To celebrate the band's 20th anniversary in 2007, Noaki returned for what was supposed to be a few performances, including one at Loud Park '07. But the following year it was announced he would fully rejoin Outrage, and in 2009 they released a new self-titled album, which was recorded in Sweden with Fredrik Nordström and marked a return to their thrash sound. On March 23, 2010, the band was given the "Aichi Prefecture Cultural Art Prize" for their continued musical activities in their hometown of Nagoya.
