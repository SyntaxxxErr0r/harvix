70.50	Pyrite	Pyrite	The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, is an iron sulfide with the formula FeS2. This mineral's metallic luster and pale-to-normal, brass-yellow hue have earned it the nickname fool's gold because of its resemblance to gold. The color has also led to the nicknames brass, brazzle and Brazil, primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Pyrite_3.jpg/240px-Pyrite_3.jpg
