1.00	La_Bodeguita_del_Medio	Bodeguita del medio	La Bodeguita del Medio is a typical restaurant-bar of Havana (Cuba). It is a famous tourist destination because of the personalities which have patronized it: Salvador Allende, the poet Pablo Neruda, the writer Ernest Hemingway, the artist Josignacio and many others. La Bodeguita lays claim to being the birthplace of the Mojito cocktail, prepared in the bar since its opening in 1942, although this is disputed. The rooms are full of curious objects, frames, photos, as well as the walls covered by signatures of famous or unknown customers, recounting the islandâ€™s past.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Bodeguita_del_Medio%2C_Havana%2C_Cuba_9.jpg/220px-Bodeguita_del_Medio%2C_Havana%2C_Cuba_9.jpg
