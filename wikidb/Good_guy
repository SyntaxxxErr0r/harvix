1.00	Good_guy	Hero	A hero (heroine is usually used for females) (Greek: ), in Greek mythology and folklore, was originally a demigod, their cult being one of the most distinctive features of ancient Greek religion. Later, hero (male) and heroine (female) came to refer to characters who, in the face of danger and adversity or from a position of weakness, display courage and the will for self sacrifice—that is, heroism—for some greater good of all humanity. This definition originally referred to martial courage or excellence but extended to more general moral excellence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Risorgimento%2C_Giuseppe_Garibaldi.jpg/220px-Risorgimento%2C_Giuseppe_Garibaldi.jpg
