56.3	Chaplain	Chaplain	Traditionally, a chaplain is a minister in a specialized setting such as a priest, pastor, rabbi, or imam or lay representative of a religion attached to a secular institution such as a hospital, prison, military unit, police department, university, or private chapel. Though originally the word "chaplain" referred to representatives of the Christian faith, it is now applied to men and women of other religions or philosophical traditionsâ€“such as in the case of the humanist chaplains serving with military forces in the Netherlands and Belgium. In recent years many lay individuals have received professional training in chaplaincy and are now appointed as chaplains in schools, hospitals, universities, prisons and elsewhere to work alongside or instead of official members of the clergy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/US_Navy_080615-N-1281H-130_Chaplain_Lt._Barbara_Wood_partakes_in_communion_during_a_Sunday_morning_service_aboard_Nimitz-class_USS_Abraham_Lincoln_%28CVN_72%29.jpg/200px-US_Navy_080615-N-1281H-130_Chaplain_Lt._Barbara_Wood_partakes_in_communion_during_a_Sunday_morning_service_aboard_Nimitz-class_USS_Abraham_Lincoln_%28CVN_72%29.jpg
