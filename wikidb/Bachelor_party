35.57	Bachelor_party	Bachelor party	A bachelor party , also known as a stag party, stag night or stag do (especially in Commonwealth countries and Ireland), a bull's party (South Africa), or a buck's party or buck's night (Australia), is a party held for a man shortly before he enters marriage, to celebrate his "last night of freedom" or merely to spend time with his male friends, who are often at his wedding party afterwards. A bachelor party is usually planned by the best man or other friends of the groom, occasionally, with the assistance of a bachelor party planning company.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Wes%27_Bachelor_Party_005.jpg/220px-Wes%27_Bachelor_Party_005.jpg
