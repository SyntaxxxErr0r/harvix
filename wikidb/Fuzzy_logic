205.3	Fuzzy_logic	Fuzzy logic	Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic; it deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact. In contrast with traditional logic theory, where binary sets have two-valued logic: true or false, fuzzy logic variables may have a truth value that ranges in degree between 0 and 1. Fuzzy logic has been extended to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. Furthermore, when linguistic variables are used, these degrees may be managed by specific functions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Fuzzy_logic_temperature_en.svg/300px-Fuzzy_logic_temperature_en.svg.png
