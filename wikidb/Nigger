66.1	Nigger	Nigger	Nigger is a noun in the English language, most notable for its usage in a pejorative context to refer to black people (generally people of Sub-Saharan African descent), and also as an informal slang term, among other contexts. It is a common ethnic slur, and suggests that its target is extremely unsophisticated. The word originated as a term used in a neutral context to refer to black people, as a variation of the Spanish/Portuguese noun negro, a descendant of the Latin adjective niger, meaning the color "black".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/MrBradish.jpg/220px-MrBradish.jpg
