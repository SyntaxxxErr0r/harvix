3.01	Mise-en-sc%C3%A8ne	Mise en scène	Mise-en-scène (French pronunciation: "placing on stage") is an expression used to describe the design aspects of a theatre or film production, which essentially means "visual theme" or "telling a story"—both in visually artful ways through storyboarding, cinematography and stage design, and in poetically artful ways through direction. Mise-en-scène has been called film criticism's "grand undefined term".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/CABINET_DES_DR_CALIGARI_01.jpg
