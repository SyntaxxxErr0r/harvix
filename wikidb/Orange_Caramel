2.10	Orange_Caramel	Orange Caramel	Orange Caramel (Hangul: 오렌지 캬라멜), is the first sub group formed from the South Korean pop group After School. This sub-unit was formed with the three newest members: Nana, Raina and Lizzy. Orange Caramel’s concept is more lighthearted and sweet unlike many girl groups that have recently taken on darker, sexier concepts.
