56.3	Anus	Anus	The anus is an opening at the opposite end of an animal's digestive tract from the mouth. Its function is to control the expulsion of feces, unwanted semi-solid matter produced during digestion, which, depending on the type of animal, may be one or more of: matter which the animal cannot digest, such as bones; food material after all the nutrients have been extracted, for example cellulose or lignin; ingested matter which would be toxic if it remained in the digestive tract; and dead or excess gut bacteria and other endosymbionts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Protovsdeuterostomes.svg/250px-Protovsdeuterostomes.svg.png
