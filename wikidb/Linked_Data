170.7	Linked_Data	Linked data	In computing, linked data describes a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and queried.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/LOD_Cloud_Diagram_as_of_September_2011.png/220px-LOD_Cloud_Diagram_as_of_September_2011.png
