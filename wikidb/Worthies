2.00	Worthies	Nine Worthies	The Nine Worthies are nine historical, scriptural and legendary personages who personify the ideals of chivalry as were established in the Middle Ages. All are commonly referred to as 'Princes' in their own right, despite whatever true titles each man may have held. In French they are called Les Neuf Preux, meaning "Nine Valiants", which term gives a slightly more focused idea of the sort of moral virtue they were deemed to represent so perfectly, that of soldierly courage and generalship. The study of the life of each would thus form a good education for the aspirant to chivalric status. In Italy they are i Nove Prodi.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Neun_gute_helden_rathaus_koeln.jpg/350px-Neun_gute_helden_rathaus_koeln.jpg
