56.1	Chess_boxing	Chess boxing	Chessboxing is a hybrid sport that combines chess with boxing in alternating rounds. Five events organised by the World Chess Boxing Organisation have been held in Germany overall. In London, England there have been 15 international chessboxing tournaments since 2008. Several other chessboxing events have taken place around the world, including in Los Angeles, Nantes (France), Reykjav√≠k (Iceland), Amsterdam and Krasnoyarsk (Russia) although London in particular has emerged as the most important centre for chessboxing. The sport was invented by Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, who was inspired by a French comic book 'Le Froid Equateur' by artist and filmmaker Enki Bilal. Chess boxing is now growing in popularity. Participants must be skilled as both boxers and chess players, as a match may be won either way.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Schachboxen1.jpg/300px-Schachboxen1.jpg
