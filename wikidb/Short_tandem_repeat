56.0	Short_tandem_repeat	Short tandem repeat	A short tandem repeat (STR) in DNA occurs when a pattern of two or more nucleotides are repeated and the repeated sequences are directly adjacent to each other. The pattern can range in length from 2 to 5 base pairs (bp) (for example (CATG)n in a genomic region) and is typically in the non-coding intron region. A short tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) occurs when homologous STR loci differ in the number of repeats between individuals. By identifying repeats of a specific sequence at specific locations in the genome, it is possible to create a genetic profile of an individual. There are currently over 10,000 published STR sequences in the human genome. STR analysis has become the prevalent analysis method for determining genetic profiles in forensic cases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Str_profile.jpg/400px-Str_profile.jpg
