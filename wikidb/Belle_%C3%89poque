Occurring during the era of the Third French Republic and the German Empire, it was a period characterised by optimism and new technological and medical discoveries. The Belle Époque was named in retrospect, when it began to be considered a "golden age" when compared to the horrors of World War I.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Vin_mariani_publicite156.jpg/180px-Vin_mariani_publicite156.jpg
