2.00	EOS_1D	Canon EOS-1D	The Canon EOS-1D is a 4-megapixel professional digital single-lens reflex camera launched in November 2001. It was Canon's first professional-level digital camera developed and released by themselves, the previous D2000 being a collaborative effort with Kodak. It has a 1.3x crop factor with a CCD image sensor sourced from Panasonic. The camera shares its body design with the Canon EOS-1V 35mm camera (with the additional battery grip attached). It was succeeded by the 1D Mark II in January 2004.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Canon_EOS-1D.jpg/300px-Canon_EOS-1D.jpg
