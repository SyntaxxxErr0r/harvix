132.9	GNU_Compiler_Collection	GNU Compiler Collection	The GNU Compiler Collection is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages. GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain. As well as being the official compiler of the unfinished GNU operating system, GCC has been adopted as the standard compiler by most other modern Unix-like computer operating systems, including Linux, the BSD family and Mac OS X. A port to RISC OS has also been developed extensively in recent years. There is also an old (3.0) port of GCC to Plan9, running under its ANSI/POSIX Environment (APE). GCC is also available for the widely-used Microsoft Windows operating systems, and for the ARM processor used by many portable devices.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Gccegg.svg/100px-Gccegg.svg.png
