1.00	Richard_Drake	Richard Drake	Richard Drake of Esher (1535 – 11 July 1603), Equerry of the Stable to Queen Elizabeth I, was the son of John Drake, of Ashe, and Amy (née Grenville); he was a brother of Sir Bernard Drake. He served as factor and prize agent to Sir Francis Drake (to whom he may have been very distantly related), taking charge of the Spanish Armada prisoners taken off Plymouth in 1588, which included the Spanish vice-admiral, Don Pedro de Valdés, whom he kept at his manor of Esher in Surrey, pending arrangements for the ransom, a subject over which his heirs and those of Sir Francis quarrelled.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Richard_Drake_George_Gower_1577.jpg/220px-Richard_Drake_George_Gower_1577.jpg
