36.03	David_I_of_Scotland	David I of Scotland	David I or Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim (Modern: Daibhidh I mac Chaluim; 1083 x 1085 – 24 May 1153) was a 12th-century ruler who was Prince of the Cumbrians (1113–1124) and later King of the Scots (1124–1153). The youngest son of Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III) and Margaret of Wessex, David spent most of his childhood in Scotland, but was exiled to England temporarily in 1093. Perhaps after 1100, he became a dependent at the court of King Henry I. There he was influenced by the Norman and Anglo-French culture of the court.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/DavidIofScotland.jpg
