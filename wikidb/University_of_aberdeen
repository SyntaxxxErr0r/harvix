It is the country's third oldest university, and the fifth oldest in the English-speaking world. The modern University of Aberdeen was formed in 1860 by the merger of two pre-existing ancient universities: King's College, located in Old Aberdeen and Marischal College, founded in 1593 and located in the new city of Aberdeen. The University is deeply embedded within the city, with many of the iconic buildings of King's College dominating Old Aberdeen. The University features a large international community of students drawn from 120 different countries and with over 650 first degree programmes, the University has an excellent reputation for teaching quality and research.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Aberdeen_university_logo.gif/250px-Aberdeen_university_logo.gif
