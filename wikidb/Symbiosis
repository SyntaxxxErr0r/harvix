86.4	Symbiosis	Symbiosis	Symbiosis (from Ancient Greek sýn "with" and bíōsis "living") is close and often long-term interaction between different biological species. In 1877, Bennett used the word symbiosis (which previously had been used of people living together in community) to describe the mutualistic relationship in lichens. In 1879, by the German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary, defined it as "the living together of unlike organisms."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Common_clownfish_curves_dnsmpl.jpg/250px-Common_clownfish_curves_dnsmpl.jpg
