The cheetah achieves by far the fastest land speed of any living animalâ€”between 112 and 120 km/h (70 and 75 mph) in short bursts covering distances up to 500 m (1,600 ft), and has the ability to accelerate from 0 to over 100 km/h (62 mph) in three seconds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/TheCheethcat.jpg/220px-TheCheethcat.jpg
