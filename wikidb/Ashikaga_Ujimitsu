Son of first Kantō Kubō Ashikaga Motouji, he succeeded his father in 1367 at the age of nine when this last suddenly died during an epidemic. It was during his reign that the Kanto Kubō title became common enough to appear for the first time in writing. It is in fact contained in a 1382 entry of the Tsurugaoka Jishoan ). This title was in itself rebellious, because it was first adopted by Takauji himself and its use therefore implied equality with the shogun. In fact, sometimes the Kanto Kubō was called Kantō Shogun.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Ashikaga_Ujimitsu.jpg/200px-Ashikaga_Ujimitsu.jpg
