1.20	Cimeliidae	Cimeliidae	Cimeliidae or the "Gold Moths" (formerly known as Axiidae) is a family of moths whose precise relationships within the Macrolepidoptera are currently uncertain, but they currently represent the only family in a recently-recognized superfamily whose nearest relatives include the butterflies, Calliduloidea, Drepanoidea, Geometroidea, Bombycoidea, Mimallonoidea and Lasiocampoidea, and the Noctuoidea. Uniquely, they have a pair of pocket-like organs on the seventh abdominal spiracle of the adult moth which are only possibly sound receptive organs. They are quite large and brightly coloured moths that occur only in Southern Europe and feed on species of Euphorbia. Sometimes they are attracted to light.
