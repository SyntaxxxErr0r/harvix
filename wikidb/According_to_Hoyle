4.01	According_to_Hoyle	Edmond Hoyle	Edmond Hoyle (1672 â€“ August 29, 1769) was a writer best known for his works on the rules and play of card games. The phrase "according to Hoyle" came into the language as a reflection of his generally-perceived authority on the subject; since that time, use of the phrase has expanded into general use in situations in which a speaker wishes to indicate an appeal to a putative authority.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Edmond_Hoyle.jpg/220px-Edmond_Hoyle.jpg
