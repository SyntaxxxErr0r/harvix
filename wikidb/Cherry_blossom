Many of the varieties that have been cultivated for ornamental use do not produce fruit. Edible cherries generally come from cultivars of the related species Prunus avium and Prunus cerasus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/2007_Sakura_of_Fukushima-e_007_rotated.jpg/190px-2007_Sakura_of_Fukushima-e_007_rotated.jpg
