177.6	Poet	Poet	A poet is a person who writes poetry. A poet's work can be literal, meaning that his work is derived from a specific event, or metaphorical, meaning that his work can take on many meanings and forms. Poets have existed since antiquity, in nearly all languages, and have produced works that vary greatly in different cultures and time periods. Throughout each civilization and language, poets have used various styles that have changed through the course of literary history, resulting in a history of poets as diverse as the literature they have produced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Calligramme.jpg/230px-Calligramme.jpg
