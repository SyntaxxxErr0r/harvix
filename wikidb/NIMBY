120.1	NIMBY	NIMBY	NIMBY or Nimby is an acronym for the phrase "not in my back yard". The term (or the derivative Nimbyism) is used pejoratively to describe opposition by residents to a proposal for a new development close to them. Opposing residents themselves are sometimes called Nimbies. The term was coined in 1980 by Emilie Travel Livezey, and was popularized by British politician Nicholas Ridley, who was Conservative Secretary of State for the Environment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Airport_overhead.jpg/220px-Airport_overhead.jpg
