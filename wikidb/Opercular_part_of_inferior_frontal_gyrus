1.20	Opercular_part_of_inferior_frontal_gyrus	Opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus	In the human brain the Pars opercularis (literally "the part that covers") is the part of the inferior frontal gyrus that lies between the inferior precentral sulcus and the ascending ramus of the lateral sulcus. It is called opercularis because it covers part of the insula. The pars opercularis together with the pars triangularis form Broca's area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Operculum.png/250px-Operculum.png
