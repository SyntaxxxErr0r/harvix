Their history can be traced back to the 18th century at least. The glassworks have become part of the culture of Sweden; examples can be found in many Swedish homes, recognizable by a small sticker at the bottom with the name Orrefors, Kosta, etc.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Glasriket-Sm%C3%A5land.jpg/250px-Glasriket-Sm%C3%A5land.jpg
