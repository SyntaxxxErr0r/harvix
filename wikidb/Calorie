153.4	Calorie	Calorie	The calorie is a pre-SI metric unit of energy. It was first defined by Nicolas Cl√©ment in 1824 as a unit of heat, entering French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867. In most fields its use is archaic, having been replaced by the SI unit of energy, the joule. However, in many countries it remains in common use as a unit of food energy.
