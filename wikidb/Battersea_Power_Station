52.7	Battersea_Power_Station	Battersea Power Station	Battersea Power Station is a decommissioned coal-fired power station located on the south bank of the River Thames, in Battersea, South London. It comprises two individual power stations, built in two stages in the form of a single building. Battersea A Power Station was built in the 1930s, with Battersea B Power Station to its east in the 1950s. The two stations were built to an identical design, providing the well known four-chimney layout. The station ceased generating electricity in 1983, but over the past 50 years it has become one of the best known landmarks in London and is Grade II* listed. The station's celebrity owes much to numerous cultural appearances, which include a shot in The Beatles' 1965 movie Help!, and being used in the cover art of Pink Floyd's 1977 album Animals. In addition, a photograph of the plant's control room was used as cover art on Hawkwind's 1977 album Quark, Strangeness and Charm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Battersea_Power_Station%2C_London-22May2010.jpg/220px-Battersea_Power_Station%2C_London-22May2010.jpg
