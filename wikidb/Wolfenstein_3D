103.9	Wolfenstein_3D	Wolfenstein 3D	Wolfenstein 3D is a seminal first-person shooter game first released in 1992, pitting the player, a captured American spy, against a horde of WWII-era Nazis ensconced within Castle Wolfenstein. It is widely regarded by critics and game journalists as having helped popularize the genre on the PC, and having established the basic run-and-gun archetype for subsequent FPS games. It was created by id Software and published by Apogee Software. Released on May 5, 1992 for DOS, the game was inspired by the 1980s Muse Software computer games Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Wolfenstein-3d.jpg/250px-Wolfenstein-3d.jpg
