130.3	John_Stuart_Mill	John Stuart Mill	John Stuart Mill, (20 May 1806 â€“ 8 May 1873) was a British philosopher, political economist and civil servant. He was also an influential contributor to social theory, political theory, and political economy. He has been called "the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century" Mill's conception of liberty justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state control. He was a proponent of utilitarianism, an ethical theory developed by Jeremy Bentham. Hoping to remedy the problems found in an inductive approach to science, such as confirmation bias, he clearly set forth the premises of falsification as the key component in the scientific method. Mill was also a Member of Parliament and an important figure in liberal political philosophy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/John_Stuart_Mill_by_John_Watkins%2C_1865.jpg/220px-John_Stuart_Mill_by_John_Watkins%2C_1865.jpg
