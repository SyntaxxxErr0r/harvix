94.1	Reason	Reason	Reason is a term that refers to the capacity human beings have to make sense of things, to establish and verify facts, and to change or justify practices, institutions, and beliefs. It is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a definitive characteristic of human nature. The concept of reason is sometimes referred to as rationality and sometimes as discursive reason, in opposition to intuitive reason.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Goya_Caprichos3.jpg/220px-Goya_Caprichos3.jpg
