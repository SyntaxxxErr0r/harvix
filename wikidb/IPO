62.9	IPO	Initial public offering	An initial public offering or stock market launch, is the first sale of stock by a company to the public. It can be used by either small or large companies to raise expansion capital and become publicly traded enterprises. Many companies that undertake an IPO also request the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter to help them correctly assess the value of their shares, that is, the share price (IPO Initial Public Offerings, 2011).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Met_life_tower_crop.jpg/135px-Met_life_tower_crop.jpg
