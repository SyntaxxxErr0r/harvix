27.36	Proud_Mary	Proud Mary	"Proud Mary" is a rock song written by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist John Fogerty, and recorded by his band Creedence Clearwater Revival. The song was released as a single from the band's second studio album, Bayou Country, both released by Fantasy Records in January 1969 (although another reference related to album liner notes says just before Christmas, which would imply December 1968). The song became a hit in the United States, peaking at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March, 1969, the first of five consecutive singles to peak at #2 for the group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a3/TinaTurner_ProudMary.jpg/220px-TinaTurner_ProudMary.jpg
