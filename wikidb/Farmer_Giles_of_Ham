20.31	Farmer_Giles_of_Ham	Farmer Giles of Ham	"Farmer Giles of Ham" is a Medieval fable written by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1937 and published in 1949. The story describes the encounters between Farmer Giles and a wily dragon named Chrysophylax, and how Giles manages to use these to rise from humble beginnings to rival the king of the land. It is cheerfully anachronistic and light-hearted, set in a fantasy Great Britain of long ago, with mythical creatures, medieval knights, and primitive firearms. It is only tangentially connected with the author's Middle-earth legendarium: both were originally intended as essays in "English mythology".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/FarmerGilesOfHam.jpg/220px-FarmerGilesOfHam.jpg
