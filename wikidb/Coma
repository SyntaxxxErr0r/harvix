84.5	Coma	Coma	In medicine, a coma (from the Greek koma, meaning deep sleep) is a state of unconsciousness, lasting more than 6 hours in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, sound, lacks a normal sleep-wake cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions. A person in a state of coma is described as comatose. According to the Glasgow Coma Scale though, a person with confusion is considered to be in the mildest coma.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Decorticate.PNG/220px-Decorticate.PNG
