63.4	Lemuria_(continent)	Lemuria (continent)	Lemuria ( ) is the name of a hypothetical "lost land" variously located in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The concept's 19th century origins lie in attempts to account for discontinuities in biogeography; however, the concept of Lemuria has been rendered obsolete by modern theories of plate tectonics. Although sunken continents do exist – like Zealandia in the Pacific and the Kerguelen Plateau in the Indian Ocean – there is no known geological formation under the Indian or Pacific Oceans that corresponds to the hypothetical Lemuria .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Ancientlemuria.jpg/250px-Ancientlemuria.jpg
