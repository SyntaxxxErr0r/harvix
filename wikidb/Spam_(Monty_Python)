84.7	Spam_(Monty_Python)	Spam (Monty Python)	"Spam" is a popular Monty Python sketch, first televised in 1970. In the sketch, two customers are in a greasy spoon caf√© trying to order a breakfast from a menu that includes Spam in almost every dish. The term spam (in electronic communication, and general slang) is derived from this sketch. The sketch was written by Terry Jones and Michael Palin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/MontySpam.jpg/350px-MontySpam.jpg
