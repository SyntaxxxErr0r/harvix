4.00	House_of_Stewart	House of Stuart	The House of Stuart (previously spelt Stewart) is a European royal house. Founded by Robert II of Scotland, the Stewarts first became monarchs of the Kingdom of Scotland during the late 14th century, and subsequently held the position of the Kings of Great Britain and Ireland. Their patrilineal ancestors (from Brittany) had held the title High Steward of Scotland since the 12th century, after arriving by way of Norman England. The dynasty inherited further territory by the 17th century which covered the entire British Isles, including the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland, also upholding a claim to the Kingdom of France.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg/230px-Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg.png
