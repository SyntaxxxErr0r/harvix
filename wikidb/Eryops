6.44	Eryops	Eryops	Eryops ( ) meaning "drawn-out face" because most of its skull was in front of its eyes (Greek ερυειν, eryein = drawn-out + ωψ, ops = face) is a genus of extinct, semiaquatic amphibian found primarily in the Lower Permian-aged Admiral Formation (about 295 million years ago) of Archer County, Texas, but fossils are also found in New Mexico and parts of the eastern United States. Eryops also occurs in older Pennsylvanian strata of the Conemaugh Group in West Virginia Eryops averaged a little over 1.5-2.0 meters (5–6 ft) long, making it one of the largest land animals of its time. It weighed about 90 kilograms (200 lb). It probably had few predators, though it would have likely been an easy target for a predator such as Dimetrodon, which was larger and was likely the apex predator at the time. Several complete skeletons of Eryops have been found in the Lower Permian, but skull plates and teeth are the most common fossils. Although it had no direct descendants, it is the best-known Permian amphibian and a remarkable example of natural engineering.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Eryops_-_National_Museum_of_Natural_History_-_IMG_1974.JPG/250px-Eryops_-_National_Museum_of_Natural_History_-_IMG_1974.JPG
