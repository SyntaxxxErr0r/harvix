52.1	Inland_Empire_(California)	Inland Empire (California)	The Inland Empire (colloquially known as the I.E.) is a metropolitan area and region of Southern California. The Inland Empire sits directly east of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The term "Inland Empire" is most commonly used in reference to the U.S. Census Bureau's federally defined Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area, which covers more than 27,000 square miles (70,000 km2). The metropolitan area consists of Riverside County and San Bernardino County and, according to the US Census, is home to over 4 million people and is the 13th most populous metropolitan area in the United States, and the third largest in the state of California. Most of the area's population is located in the southwest corner of the region. At the end of the 19th century, the Inland Empire was a major center of agriculture, including citrus, dairy, and wine-making. Agriculture declined through the 20th century, and since the 1970s a rapidly growing population, fed by families migrating in search of affordable housing, has led to more residential, commercial, and industrial development. The Inland Empire also has the desert resort cities of Palm Springs and Palm Desert. The U.S. Census Bureau also combines the Inland Empire and the Los Angeles metropolitan areas into a larger region known as the Greater Los Angeles Area with a population of over 17 million.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Riverside_06Skyline.JPG/280px-Riverside_06Skyline.JPG
