128.7	Nine_Inch_Nails	Nine Inch Nails	Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated as NIN, sometimes stylized as NIÐ˜) is an American industrial rock project, founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. As its main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for its direction. Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres. After recording a new album, Reznor (until the 2009 Wave Goodbye Tour) usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e2/NIN2009torontoVFEST.png/250px-NIN2009torontoVFEST.png
