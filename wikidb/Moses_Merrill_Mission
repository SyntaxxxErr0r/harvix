1.00	Moses_Merrill_Mission	Moses Merrill Mission	The Moses Merrill Mission, also known as the Oto Mission, was located about eight miles west of Bellevue, Nebraska. It was built and occupied by Moses and Eliza Wilcox Merrill, the first missionaries resident in Nebraska. The first building was part of facilities built in 1835 when the United States Government removed the Otoe about eight miles southwest of Bellevue. Merrill's goal was to convert the local Otoe tribe to Christianity; he had learned the language and translated the Bible and some hymns into Otoe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Pawnee01.png/220px-Pawnee01.png
