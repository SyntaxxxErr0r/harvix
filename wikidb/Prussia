72.1	Prussia	Prussia	Prussia ; Latin: Borussia, Prutenia; Latvian: ; Lithuanian: ; Polish: ; Old Prussian: PrÅ«sa; Danish: ; Russian: ) was a German kingdom and historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg. For centuries, the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organized and effective army. Prussia shaped the history of Germany, with its capital in Berlin after 1451. After 1871, Prussia was increasingly merged into Germany, losing its distinctive identity. In November 1918 the royalty abdicated and the nobility lost most of its political power. Prussia was effectively abolished in 1932, and officially abolished in 1947.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg/125px-Flag_of_Prussia_1892-1918.svg.png
