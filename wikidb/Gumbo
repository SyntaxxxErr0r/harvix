93.1	Gumbo	Gumbo	Gumbo is a stew or soup that probably originated in southern Louisiana during the 18th century. It typically consists primarily of a strongly-flavored stock, meat or shellfish, a thickener, and seasoning vegetables, which can include celery, bell peppers, and onions(a trio known in Cajun cuisine as the "Holy trinity"). Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used: the African vegetable okra, the Choctaw spice filé powder (dried and ground sassafras leaves), or roux, the French base made of flour and fat. The dish likely derived its name from either the Bantu word for okra or the Choctaw word for filé (kombo).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Shrimp_gumbo.jpg/300px-Shrimp_gumbo.jpg
