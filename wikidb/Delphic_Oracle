The Pythia was widely credited for her prophecies inspired by Apollo. The Delphic oracle was established in the 8th century BC. The last recorded response was given during AD 393, when the emperor Theodosius I ordered pagan temples to cease operation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Collier-priestess_of_Delphi.jpg/220px-Collier-priestess_of_Delphi.jpg
