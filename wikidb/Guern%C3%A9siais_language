1.00	Guern%C3%A9siais_language	Guernésiais	Guernésiais, also known as Dgèrnésiais, Guernsey French, and Guernsey Norman French, is the variety of the Norman language spoken in Guernsey. It is sometimes known on the island by the semi-disparaging name "patois". As one of the Oïl languages, it has its roots in Latin, but has had strong influence from both Norse and English at different points in its history.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Dgernesiais_welcome_sign_St_Peter_Port_Guernsey.jpg/220px-Dgernesiais_welcome_sign_St_Peter_Port_Guernsey.jpg
