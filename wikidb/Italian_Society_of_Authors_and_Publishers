1.10	Italian_Society_of_Authors_and_Publishers	Italian Society of Authors and Publishers	Unlike other organisations, in Italy there is a single body responsible for the protection of both authors and publishers.

It has been observed that this choice favours publishers, who are in fact the managers in many cases, and that rights are surrendered by the authors.
