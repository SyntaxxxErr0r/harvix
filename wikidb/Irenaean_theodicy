1.20	Irenaean_theodicy	Irenaean theodicy	The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy designed to respond to the problem of evil. As such, it attempts to defend the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of the theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while God is responsible for creating evil, he is not guilty. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the best of all possible worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Saint_Irenaeus.jpg/220px-Saint_Irenaeus.jpg
