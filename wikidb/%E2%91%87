1.00	%E2%91%87	Magnetic ink character recognition	Magnetic Ink Character Recognition, or MICR, is a character recognition technology used primarily by the banking industry to facilitate the processing of cheques and makes up the routing number and account number at the bottom of a check. The technology allows computers to read information (such as account numbers) off printed documents. Unlike barcodes or similar technologies, however, MICR codes can be easily read by humans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/CanadianChequeSamplePAR.png/240px-CanadianChequeSamplePAR.png
