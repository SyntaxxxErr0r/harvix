1.00	Postdenominationalism	Post-denominational churches	Post-denominational churches, (or postdenominational), can be interpreted in many ways, but as applied to Christianity, it is the attitude that the Body of Christ extends to born again Christians in other denominations, and is not limited just to one's own religious group. Its focus on doctrine distinguishes it from Ecumenism.
