54.9	Triangulation_(politics)	Triangulation (politics)	Triangulation is the name given to the act of a political candidate presenting his or her ideology as being "above" and "between" the "left" and "right" sides (or "wings") of a traditional (e.g. UK or US) democratic "political spectrum". It involves adopting for oneself some of the ideas of one's political opponent (or apparent opponent). The logic behind it is that it both takes credit for the opponent's ideas, and insulates the triangulator from attacks on that particular issue. Opponents of triangulation , who believe in a fundamental "left" and "right", consider the dynamic a deviation from its "reality" and dismiss those that strive for it as whimsical.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Conceptual_diagram_of_political_triangulation.png/300px-Conceptual_diagram_of_political_triangulation.png
