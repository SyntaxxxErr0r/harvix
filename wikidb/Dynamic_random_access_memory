70.4	Dynamic_random_access_memory	Dynamic random-access memory	Dynamic random-access memory is a type of random-access memory that stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit. The capacitor can be either charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1. Since capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a dynamic memory as opposed to SRAM and other static memory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/Original_1T1C_DRAM_design.svg/220px-Original_1T1C_DRAM_design.svg.png
