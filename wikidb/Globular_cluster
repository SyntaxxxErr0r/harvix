59.6	Globular_cluster	Globular cluster	A globular cluster is a spherical collection of stars that orbits a galactic core as a satellite. Globular clusters are very tightly bound by gravity, which gives them their spherical shapes and relatively high stellar densities toward their centers. The name of this category of star cluster is derived from the Latin globulusâ€”a small sphere. A globular cluster is sometimes known more simply as a globular.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/A_Swarm_of_Ancient_Stars_-_GPN-2000-000930.jpg/300px-A_Swarm_of_Ancient_Stars_-_GPN-2000-000930.jpg
