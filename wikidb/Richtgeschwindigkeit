3.31	Richtgeschwindigkeit	Advisory speed limit	An advisory speed limit is a speed limit that is recommended by a governing body, but is not enforced. Advisory speed limits are often set in areas with many pedestrians, such as in city centres and outside schools, and on difficult stretches of roads, such as on tight corners or through roadworks. While travelling above the advisory speed limit is not an offence, liability for any accidents that occur as a result of traveling above the limit can be placed partially or entirely on the speeder.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Advisory_Curve_Speed_English_40.svg/170px-Advisory_Curve_Speed_English_40.svg.png
