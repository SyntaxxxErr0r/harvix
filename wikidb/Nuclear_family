51.1	Nuclear_family	Nuclear family	Nuclear family is a term used to define a family group consisting of a pair of adults and their children. This is in contrast to the smaller single-parent family, and to the larger extended family. Nuclear families typically center on a married couple, but not always; the nuclear family may have any number of children. There are differences in definition among observers; some definitions allow only biological children that are full-blood siblings, while others allow for a stepparent and any mix of dependent children including stepchildren and adopted children.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/170px-SNA_segment.png
