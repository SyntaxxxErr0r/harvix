1.10	Archimedes	Archimedes	Archimedes of Syracuse (Greek: ; c. BC â€“ c. BC) was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Among his advances in physics are the foundations of hydrostatics, statics and an explanation of the principle of the lever. He is credited with designing innovative machines, including siege engines and the screw pump that bears his name. Modern experiments have tested claims that Archimedes designed machines capable of lifting attacking ships out of the water and setting ships on fire using an array of mirrors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Domenico-Fetti_Archimedes_1620.jpg/220px-Domenico-Fetti_Archimedes_1620.jpg
