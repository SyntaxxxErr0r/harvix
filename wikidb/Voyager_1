Operating for 34 years, 6 months and 24 days as of today , the spacecraft receives routine commands and transmits data back to the Deep Space Network. At a distance of 120 astronomical units (1.810 km) as of February 2012, it is the farthest man-made object from Earth. Voyager 1 is now in the heliosheath, which is the outermost layer of the heliosphere. It will most likely be the first probe to leave the Solar System.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Voyager.jpg/290px-Voyager.jpg
