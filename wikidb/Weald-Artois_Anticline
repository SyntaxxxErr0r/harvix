1.00	Weald-Artois_Anticline	Weald–Artois Anticline	The Weald–Artois anticline is a large anticline, a geological structure running between the regions of the Weald in southern England and the Artois in northeastern France. The fold formed during the Alpine orogeny, from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene as an uplifted form of the Weald basin through inversion of the basin. The folding resulted in uplift of about 180 metres = 590 feet, though concurrent erosion may have substantially reduced the actual height of the resulting chalk ridges.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Geologic_map_SE_England_%26_Channel_EN.svg/220px-Geologic_map_SE_England_%26_Channel_EN.svg.png
