1.00	History_of_Styria	History of Styria	The history of Styria concerns the region roughly corresponding to the modern Austrian state of Styria and the Slovene region of Styria from its settlement by Germans and Slavs in the Dark Ages until the present. This mountainous and scenic region, which became a centre for mountaineering in the 19th century, is often called the "Green March", because half of the area is covered with forests and one quarter with meadows, grasslands, vineyards and orchards. Styria is also rich in minerals, soft coal and iron, which has been mined at Erzberg since the time of the Romans. The Slovenske gorice/Windisch BÃ¼heln ("Slovene Hills") is a famous wine-producing district, stretching between Slovenia and Austria. Styria was for long the most densely-populated and productive mountain region in Europe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Austria-Hungary_map.svg/250px-Austria-Hungary_map.svg.png
