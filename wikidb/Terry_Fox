60.8	Terry_Fox	Terry Fox	Terrance Stanley "Terry" Fox , (July 28, 1958 â€“ June 28, 1981) was a Canadian humanitarian, athlete, and cancer research activist. In 1980, with one leg having been amputated, he embarked on a cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and 5,373 kilometres (3,339 mi), and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual Terry Fox Run, first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over C$500 million has been raised in his name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/TerryFoxToronto19800712.JPG/200px-TerryFoxToronto19800712.JPG
