Traditionally made of rice straw to form the core (though nowadays sometimes the core is composed of compressed wood chip boards or polystyrene foam), with a covering of woven soft rush straw, tatami are made in standard sizes, with the length exactly twice the width. Usually, on the long sides, they have edging (heri) of brocade or plain cloth, although some tatami have no edging.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Youkoukan06n4592.jpg/220px-Youkoukan06n4592.jpg
