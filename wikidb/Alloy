76.6	Alloy	Alloy	An alloy is a mixture or metallic solid solution composed of two or more elements. Complete solid solution alloys give single solid phase microstructure, while partial solutions give two or more phases that may or may not be homogeneous in distribution, depending on thermal (heat treatment) history. Alloys usually have different properties from those of the component elements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Steel_wire_rope.png/220px-Steel_wire_rope.png
