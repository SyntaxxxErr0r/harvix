They were historically developed as gundogs to retrieve shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties. They were named retriever from their ability to retrieve game undamaged and have an instinctive love of water. Golden retrievers have a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth and a water repellent outer coat that lies flat against their body.The official colour of the breed is the varying shades of gold that are most often seen. These dogs are well suited to suburban or country environments. Although they need lots of outdoor exercise, they should be kept fenced in because of their instincts as hunting dogs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Golden_Retriever_standing_Tucker.jpg/220px-Golden_Retriever_standing_Tucker.jpg
