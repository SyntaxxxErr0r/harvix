61.5	Daniel_Boone	Daniel Boone	Daniel Boone (November 2, 1734 â€“ September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer, and frontiersman whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States. Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now the Commonwealth of Kentucky, which was then beyond the western borders of the settled part of the Thirteen Colonies. This region legally belonged to both the Commonwealth of Virginia and to the American Indian Tribes at the time. Despite some resistance from American Indian tribes such as the Shawnee, in 1775 Boone blazed his Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap in the Appalachian Mountains from North Carolina and Tennessee into Kentucky. There he founded the village of Boonesborough, Kentucky, one of the first English-speaking settlements west of the Appalachians. Before the end of the 18th century, more than 200,000 European people migrated to Kentucky/Virginia by following the route marked by Boone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Unfinished_portrait_of_Daniel_Boone_by_Chester_Harding_1820.jpg/200px-Unfinished_portrait_of_Daniel_Boone_by_Chester_Harding_1820.jpg
