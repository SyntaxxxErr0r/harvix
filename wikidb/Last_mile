83.9	Last_mile	Last mile	The "last mile" or "last kilometer" is the final leg of delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer. The phrase is therefore often used by the telecommunications and cable television industries. The actual distance of this leg may be considerably more than a mile, especially in rural areas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/The_last_mile_hierarchy.svg/350px-The_last_mile_hierarchy.svg.png
