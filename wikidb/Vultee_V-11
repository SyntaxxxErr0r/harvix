1.00	Vultee_V-11	Vultee YA-19	The Vultee V-11 and V-12 were American attack aircraft of the 1930s. Developments of the Vultee V-1 single-engined airliner, the V-11 and V-12 were purchased by several nation's armed forces, including China, who used them in combat against Japanese forces in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The United States Army Air Corps purchased small numbers of the V-11 as the Vultee YA-19 in the years before World War II, testing them to gather data to compare against twin engine light attack planes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/051118-F-1234P-016.jpg/300px-051118-F-1234P-016.jpg
