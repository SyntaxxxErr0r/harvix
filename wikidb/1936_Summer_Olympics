80.7	1936_Summer_Olympics	1936 Summer Olympics	The 1936 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event which was held in 1936 in Berlin, Germany. Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona, Spain on 26 April 1931, at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona (two years before the Nazis came to power). It marked the second and final time that the International Olympic Committee would gather to vote in a city which was bidding to host those Games. The only other time this occurred was at the inaugural IOC Session in Paris, France, on 24 April 1894. Then, Athens, Greece and Paris, France were chosen to host the 1896 and 1900 Games, respectively.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/1936_berlin_logo.jpg/220px-1936_berlin_logo.jpg
