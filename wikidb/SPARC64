4.02	SPARC64	SPARC64	SPARC64 is a microprocessor developed by HAL Computer Systems and fabricated by Fujitsu. It implements the SPARC V9 instruction set architecture (ISA), the first microprocessor to do so. SPARC64 was HAL's first microprocessor and was the first in the SPARC64 brand. It operates at 101 and 118 MHz. The SPARC64 was used exclusively by Fujitsu in their systems; the first systems, the Fujitsu HALstation Model 330 and Model 350 workstations, were formally announced in September 1995 and were introduced in October 1995, two years late. It was succeeded by the SPARC64 II (previously known as the SPARC64+) in 1996.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/ShiodomeCityCenter_20070317-03.jpg/140px-ShiodomeCityCenter_20070317-03.jpg
