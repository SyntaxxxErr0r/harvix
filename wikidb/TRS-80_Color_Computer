62.5	TRS-80_Color_Computer	TRS-80 Color Computer	The Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer (also marketed as the Tandy Color Computer and affectionately nicknamed CoCo) was a home computer launched in 1980. It was one of the earliest of the first generation of computers marketed for home use in English-speaking markets. While the model was eventually eclipsed by the onset of the IBM PC clones, enthusiasts have continued to affectionately tinker with the "CoCo" to the present day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/TRS-80_Color_Computer_1_front_right.jpg/320px-TRS-80_Color_Computer_1_front_right.jpg
