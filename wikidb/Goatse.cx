81.5	Goatse.cx	goatse.cx	Goatse.cx , often referred to simply as "Goatse", was originally an Internet shock site. It's front page featured a picture, entitled hello.jpg, showing a naked man stretching his anus with both hands, to approximately the width of his hand. The inside of his rectum is also clearly visible. Below his gaping anus, his dangling penis and scrotum are visible, as well as a golden ring on the ring finger of his left hand. This site became a notorious surprise image and Internet meme, and was—and, through external hosting, still is—used regularly for bait-and-switch pranks, preventing hot-linking in a hostile manner, and defacing websites, in order to provoke extreme reactions. Even though the site was taken down in 2004, its images are mirrored throughout the Internet today.
