60.8	Reversi	Reversi	Reversi (also marketed by Pressman under the trade name Othello) is a board game involving abstract strategy and played by two players on a board with 8 rows and 8 columns and a set of distinct pieces for each side. Pieces typically are disks with a light and a dark face, each face belonging to one player. A player's objective is to have more pieces--frequently called 'disks' (and also often spelled 'discs')-- of his or her own color at the end of the game than that of the opponent, with maximizing the 'disk differential' for the winner and minimizing it for the loser frequently being an ancillary goal that is relevant for tournament tiebreaks and/or ratings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Othello_%28Reversi%29_board.jpg/250px-Othello_%28Reversi%29_board.jpg
