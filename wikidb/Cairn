56.3	Cairn	Cairn	Cairn is a term used mainly in the English-speaking world for a man-made pile (or stack) of stones. It comes from the Irish: (plural cairn) or Scottish Gaelic: (plural c√†irn). Cairns are found all over the world in uplands, on moorland, on mountaintops, near waterways and on sea cliffs, and also in barren desert and tundra areas. They vary in size from small stone markers to entire artificial hills, and in complexity from loose, conical rock piles to delicately balanced sculptures and elaborate feats of megalithic engineering. Cairns may be painted or otherwise decorated, e.g. for increased visibility or for religious reasons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Cairn_at_Garvera%2C_Surselva%2C_Graubuenden%2C_Switzerland.jpg/200px-Cairn_at_Garvera%2C_Surselva%2C_Graubuenden%2C_Switzerland.jpg
