52.1	Antenna_(radio)	Antenna (radio)	An antenna (or aerial) is an electrical device which converts electric currents into radio waves, and vice versa. It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter applies an oscillating radio frequency electric current to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. An antenna can be used for both transmitting and receiving.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Car_radio_antenna_extended_portrait.jpeg/150px-Car_radio_antenna_extended_portrait.jpeg
