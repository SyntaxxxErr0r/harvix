1.10	Haematein	Hematein	Hematein (US spelling) or haematein is an oxidized derivative of haematoxylin, used in staining. Haematein must not be confused with haematin, which is a brown to black iron-containing pigment formed by decomposition of haemoglobin. In the Colour Index (but nowhere else), haematein is called haematine, a confusing word that wrongly implies that the compound is an amine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Haematein.png/200px-Haematein.png
