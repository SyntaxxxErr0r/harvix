578.7	KISS_principle	KISS principle	KISS is an acronym for the design principle articulated by Kelly Johnson, Keep it simple, Stupid!. Variations include "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple sir", "keep it simple or be stupid", "keep it simple and straightforward" or "keep it simple and sincere." The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex, therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
