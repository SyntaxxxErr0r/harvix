6.02	Catch_and_Release	Catch and release	Catch and release is a practice within recreational fishing intended as a technique of conservation. After capture, the fish are unhooked and returned to the water before experiencing serious exhaustion or injury. Using barbless hooks, it is often possible to release the fish without removing it from the water (a slack line is frequently sufficient).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Catch_and_release_salmon.jpg/250px-Catch_and_release_salmon.jpg
