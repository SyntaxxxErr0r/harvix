89.6	Flash_fiction	Flash fiction	Flash fiction is a style of fictional literature or fiction of extreme brevity. There is no widely accepted definition of the length of the category. Some self-described markets for flash fiction impose caps as low as three hundred words, while others consider stories as long as a thousand words to be flash fiction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Aesop-fables-rare-Book-titlepage.jpg/200px-Aesop-fables-rare-Book-titlepage.jpg
