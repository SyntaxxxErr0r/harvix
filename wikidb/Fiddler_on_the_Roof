It is based on Tevye and his Daughters (or Tevye the Milkman and Other Tales) by Sholem Aleichem. The story centers on Tevye, the father of five daughters, and his attempts to maintain his family and Jewish religious traditions while outside influences encroach upon their lives. He must cope with both the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters—each one's choice of husband moves further away from the customs of his faith—and with the edict of the Tsar that evicts the Jews from their village.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Fiddler_on_the_roof_poster.jpg/215px-Fiddler_on_the_roof_poster.jpg
