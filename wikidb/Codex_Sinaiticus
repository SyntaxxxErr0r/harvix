73.8	Codex_Sinaiticus	Codex Sinaiticus	Codex Sinaiticus (Hebrew: ‎, Greek: ; Shelfmarks and references: London, Brit. Libr., Additional Manuscripts 43725; Gregory-Aland nº א or 01, ) is one of the four great uncial codices, an ancient, handwritten copy of the Greek Bible. It is an Alexandrian text-type manuscript written in the 4th century in uncial letters on parchment. Current scholarship considers the Codex Sinaiticus to be one of the best Greek texts of the New Testament, along with that of the Codex Vaticanus. Until the discovery by Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, the Codex Vaticanus was unrivaled.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Sinaiticus_text.jpg/220px-Sinaiticus_text.jpg
