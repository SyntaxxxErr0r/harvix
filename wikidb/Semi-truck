2.00	Semi-truck	Semi-trailer truck	A semi-trailer truck, also known as a semi, tractor-trailer, truck and trailer, transfer truck, 18-wheeler, mack truck, big rig (US), transport (Canada), artic (UK and Ireland), or lorry (UK), is an articulated vehicle consisting of a towing engine , and a semi-trailer (plus possible additional trailers) that carries the freight. A semi-trailer does not trail completely behind the towing vehicle, but is attached at a point that is just forward of the rear-most axle of the towing unit, so that some fraction of the weight of the trailer is carried by the prime mover, with most of that at the rear axle (s) of the prime mover, but a small amount at the front axle (s). This arrangement requires both tractor and semi-trailer to be distinct in design from a rigid truck and trailer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/FAW_truck.jpg/220px-FAW_truck.jpg
