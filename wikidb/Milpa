26.64	Milpa	Milpa	Milpa is a crop-growing system used throughout Mesoamerica. It has been most extensively described in the Yucat√°n peninsula area of Mexico. The word milpa is a Mexican Spanish term meaning "field", and is derived from the Nahuatl word phrase mil-pa "to the field" (Nahuatl mil-li "field" + -pa "towards"). Based on the ancient agricultural methods of Maya peoples and other Mesoamerican peoples, milpa agriculture produces maize, beans, and squash. The milpa cycle calls for 2 years of cultivation and eight years of letting the area lie fallow. Agronomists point out that the system is designed to create relatively large yields of food crops without the use of artificial pesticides or fertilizers, and they point out that while it is self-sustaining at current levels of consumption, there is a danger that at more intensive levels of cultivation the milpa system can become unsustainable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Milpa_2011.jpg/220px-Milpa_2011.jpg
