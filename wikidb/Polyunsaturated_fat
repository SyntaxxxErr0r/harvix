55.1	Polyunsaturated_fat	Polyunsaturated fat	In nutrition, polyunsaturated fat, or polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), are fatty acids in which more than one carbonâ€“carbon double bond exists within the representative molecule. That is, the molecule has two or more points on its structure capable of supporting hydrogen atoms not currently part of the structure. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can assume a cis or trans conformation depending on the geometry of the double bond.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Linoleic_acid.png/300px-Linoleic_acid.png
