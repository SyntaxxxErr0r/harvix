140.2	Family	Family	In human context, a family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people affiliated by consanguinity, affinity, or co-residence. In most societies it is the principal institution for the socialization of children. Anthropologists most generally classify family organization as matrilocal (a mother and her children); conjugal (a wife, husband, and children, also called nuclear family; and consanguinal (also called an extended family) in which parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's family.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/ValentinianIIIfamily.jpg/220px-ValentinianIIIfamily.jpg
