He is sometimes referred to as the "Peasant Bruegel" to distinguish him from other members of the Brueghel dynasty, but he is also the one generally meant when the context does not make clear which Brueghel is being referred to. From 1559 he dropped the 'h' from his name and signed his paintings as Bruegel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/BruegelPortrait.jpg/220px-BruegelPortrait.jpg
