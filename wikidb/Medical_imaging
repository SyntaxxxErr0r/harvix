72.9	Medical_imaging	Medical imaging	Medical imaging is the technique and process used to create images of the human body (or parts and function thereof) for clinical purposes or medical science (including the study of normal anatomy and physiology). Although imaging of removed organs and tissues can be performed for medical reasons, such procedures are not usually referred to as medical imaging, but rather are a part of pathology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/RupturedAAA.png/250px-RupturedAAA.png
