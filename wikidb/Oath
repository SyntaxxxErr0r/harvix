50.9	Oath	Oath	An oath (from Anglo-Saxon ฤรฐ, also called plight) is either a statement of fact or a promise calling upon something or someone that the oath maker considers sacred, usually God, as a witness to the binding nature of the promise or the truth of the statement of fact. To swear is to take an oath, to make a solemn vow. Those who conscientiously object to making an oath will often make an affirmation instead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg/220px-Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg
