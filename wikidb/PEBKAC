51.0	PEBKAC	User error	User errors can be divided into two distinct categories. In the first the user enters data or instructions which are valid for the system, but not the ones intended. For example in a system intended to add two numbers together the user may enter "2" and "3" when they intended to add "2" and "4". The system returns the answer 5, which is the correct answer for the data input, rather than the answer "6" which the user expected. The second category of user errors is those that can be detected as invalid by the system. In the above example this might be entering "A" as one of the two numbers to be added.
