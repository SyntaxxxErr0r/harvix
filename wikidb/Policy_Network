The network's stated goal is to enhance co-operation and links between key progressive policymakers and academics as well as to provide a meeting place for exchanging concrete policies and practices. It was launched in 1999 by Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Gerhard Schroder, Wim Kok and Massimo Dâ€™Alema.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Leaders_group_photo%2C_Policy_Network%2C_April_6_2009.jpg/220px-Leaders_group_photo%2C_Policy_Network%2C_April_6_2009.jpg
