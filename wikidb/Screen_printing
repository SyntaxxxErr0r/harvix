51.6	Screen_printing	Screen printing	Screen printing is a printing technique that uses a woven mesh to support an ink-blocking stencil. The attached stencil forms open areas of mesh that transfer ink or other printable materials which can be pressed through the mesh as a sharp-edged image onto a substrate. A roller or squeegee is moved across the screen stencil, forcing or pumping ink past the threads of the woven mesh in the open areas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/TeeshirtCopyleft_cadre.jpg/220px-TeeshirtCopyleft_cadre.jpg
