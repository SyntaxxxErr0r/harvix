1.00	Il-Khanate	Ilkhanate	The Ilkhanate, also spelled Il-khanate (Mongolian: Хүлэгийн улс Hülegü-yn Ulus Persian: ‎), was a Mongol khanate established in Persia in the 13th century, considered a part of the Mongol Empire. The Ilkhanate was based, originally, on Genghis Khan's campaigns in the Khwarezmid Empire in 1219–1224, and founded by Genghis's grandson, Hulagu, in territories which today comprise most of Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and Pakistan. The Ilkhanate initially embraced many religions, but was particularly sympathetic to Buddhism and Christianity. Later Ilkhanate rulers, beginning with Ghazan in 1295, embraced Islam.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/59/Il-Khanate_Flag.svg/125px-Il-Khanate_Flag.svg.png
