1.00	Space_Shuttle_Rescue_Mission	STS-3xx	Space Shuttle missions designated STS-3xx (officially called Launch On Need (LON) missions) were rescue missions which would have been mounted to rescue the crew of a Space Shuttle if their vehicle was damaged and deemed unable to make a successful reentry. Such a mission would have been flown if Mission Control determined that the heat shielding tiles and reinforced carbon-carbon panels of a currently flying orbiter were damaged beyond the repair capabilities of the available on-orbit repair methods. These missions were also referred to as Launch on Demand (LOD) and Contingency Shuttle Crew Support. No mission of this type was launched during the space shuttle program.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Shuttle_Patch.svg/201px-Shuttle_Patch.svg.png
