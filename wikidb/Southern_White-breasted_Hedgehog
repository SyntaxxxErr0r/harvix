1.12	Southern_White-breasted_Hedgehog	Southern white-breasted hedgehog	The southern white-breasted hedgehog , sometimes referred to as east European hedgehog, white-bellied hedgehog or white-chested hedgehog, is very similar in lifestyle and appearance to the European hedgehog, but the former has a white spot on its chest. For a long time these two species were considered to be one. The northern white-breasted hedgehog was formerly recognized as a subspecies of the Southern white-breasted hedgehog but newer investigations see both as different species. The Southern white-breasted hedgehog and European hedgehog can hybridize.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/2008_Hedgehog_1020932.jpg/200px-2008_Hedgehog_1020932.jpg
