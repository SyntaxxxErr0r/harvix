The term, employed as a style descriptor as early as the mid-1950s, was reaffirmed in 1983 by Cara Greenberg in the title of her book, Mid-Century Modern: Furniture of the 1950s (Random House), celebrating the style which is now recognized by scholars and museums worldwide as a significant design movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Saarinen_Tulpanstolen.jpg/220px-Saarinen_Tulpanstolen.jpg
