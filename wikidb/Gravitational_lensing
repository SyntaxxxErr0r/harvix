51.4	Gravitational_lensing	Gravitational lens	A gravitational lens refers to a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant source (a background galaxy) and an observer, that is capable of bending (lensing) the light from the source, as it travels towards the observer. This effect is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/A_Horseshoe_Einstein_Ring_from_Hubble.JPG/220px-A_Horseshoe_Einstein_Ring_from_Hubble.JPG
