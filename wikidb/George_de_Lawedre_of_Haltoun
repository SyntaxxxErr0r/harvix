2.00	George_de_Lawedre_of_Haltoun	George de Lawedre of Haltoun	Nisbet states that the arms of "Lauder of Hatton" were "argent, a griffin rampant sable, beaked and membred gules, holding a sword with its forefoot, supporting a Saracen's head, proper; crest: a tower with a demi-griffin issuing out of the top of it: motto, Strike Alike". He alleges that the reason for the sword and the saracen's head is because they were descended from the 1189 crusader, Sir Robert de Lawedre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Haltoun_Arms.jpg/300px-Haltoun_Arms.jpg
