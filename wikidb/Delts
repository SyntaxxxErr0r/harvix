1.00	Delts	Deltoid muscle	In human anatomy, the deltoid muscle is the muscle forming the rounded contour of the shoulder. Anatomically, it appears to be made up of three distinct sets of fibers though electromyography suggests that it consists of at least seven groups that can be independently coordinated by the central nervous system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Deltoideus.png/250px-Deltoideus.png
