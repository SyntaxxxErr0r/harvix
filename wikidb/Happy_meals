1.00	Happy_meals	Happy Meal	A "Happy Meal" is a meal specifically marketed at children, sold at the fast-food chain McDonald's since June 1979. A toy is typically included with the food, both of which are usually contained in a small box or paper bag with the McDonald's logo. Frequently, the packaging and toy are part of a marketing tie-in to a popular film or toy-line.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/McDonalds_Happy_Meal.jpg/220px-McDonalds_Happy_Meal.jpg
