7.10	Omomyid	Omomyidae	Omomyidae is a family of early primates that radiated during the Eocene epoch between about (mya). Fossil omomyids are found in North America, Europe, Asia, and possibly Africa, making it one of two groups of Eocene primates with a geographic distribution spanning holarctic continents, the other being the adapids (family Adapidae). Early representatives of the Omomyidae and Adapidae appear suddenly at the beginning of the Eocene (59 mya) in North America, Europe, and Asia, and are the earliest known crown primates.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Anaptomorphus-descent-primates.jpg/250px-Anaptomorphus-descent-primates.jpg
