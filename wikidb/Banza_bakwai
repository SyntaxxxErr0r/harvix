2.00	Banza_bakwai	Hausa Kingdoms	The Hausa Kingdoms were a collection of independent city-states situated between the Niger River and Lake Chad. Their history is reflected in the Bayajidda legend, which describes the adventures of the Baghdadi hero Bayajidda culmulating in the killing of the dragon in the well of Daura and the marriage with the local queen Magajiya Daurama. According to the legend, the hero had a child with the queen, Bawo, and another child with the queen's maid-servant, Karbagari. It has been argued that the traditions's descent scheme was influenced by the biblical Abraham-Sarah narrative.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/AFRhausalandas.PNG/220px-AFRhausalandas.PNG
