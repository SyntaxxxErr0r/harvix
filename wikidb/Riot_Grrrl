70.0	Riot_Grrrl	Riot grrrl	Riot grrrl is an underground feminist Punk rock movement that originally started in Washington, D.C.; Olympia, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and the greater Pacific Northwest in the early to mid-1990s - it is often associated with third-wave feminism which is sometimes seen as its starting point. Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, and female empowerment. Bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Jack Off Jill (and later Scarling), Bratmobile, Adickdid, Bangs, The Butchies, Calamity Jane, Emily's Sassy Lime, Excuse 17, Fifth Column, The Frumpies, Heavens to Betsy, Huggy Bear, Sleater-Kinney, and also queercore like Team Dresch. In addition to a music scene and genre, riot grrrl is a subculture; zines, the DIY ethic, art, political action, and activism are part of the movement. Riot grrrls are known to hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Carrie_Brownstein.jpg
