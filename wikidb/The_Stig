71.6	The_Stig	The Stig	The Stig is a character in the British motoring television show Top Gear. The character plays on the anonymity of racing drivers' full-face helmets, with the running joke that nobody knows who, or indeed what, is inside the character's racing suit. The character was the creation of presenter Jeremy Clarkson and the show's producer Andy Wilman. "Stig" was a nickname for new boys at their old school, Repton. Although there is one "main" Stig, there are several "spin-off" Stigs, referred to by the presenters as "The Stig's... &lt;usually a reference to where the presenters are located&gt; ...cousin."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Black_stig.jpg/200px-Black_stig.jpg
