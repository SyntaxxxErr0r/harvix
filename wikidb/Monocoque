78.7	Monocoque	Monocoque	The word monocoque comes from the Greek for single and French for shell (coque). The technique may also be called structural skin or stressed skin. A semi-monocoque differs in having longerons and stringers. Most car bodies are not true monocoques, instead modern cars use unitary construction which is also known as unit body, unibody, or Body Frame Integral construction. This uses a system of box sections, bulkheads and tubes to provide most of the strength of the vehicle, to which the stressed skin adds relatively little strength or stiffness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Lamborghini_Aventador_LP_700-4_chassis_-_Flickr_-_J.Smith831.jpg/220px-Lamborghini_Aventador_LP_700-4_chassis_-_Flickr_-_J.Smith831.jpg
