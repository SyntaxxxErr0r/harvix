30.28	Kilauea	Kīlauea	Kīlauea (Hawaiian: ) is a volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, and one of five shield volcanoes that together form the island of Hawaii. Kīlauea means "spewing" or "much spreading" in the Hawaiian language, referring to its frequent outpouring of lava. The Puu Ōō cone has been continuously erupting in the eastern rift zone since 1983, making it the longest rift-zone eruption of the last 200 years. Thirty-five eruptions have taken place since 1952, not including the current episode. Lava less than 1000 years old covers 90% of Kīlauea, and the volume of erupted material is large enough to pave a road around the world three times.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Puu_Oo_looking_up_Kilauea_-_edit.jpg/280px-Puu_Oo_looking_up_Kilauea_-_edit.jpg
