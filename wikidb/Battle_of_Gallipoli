74.3	Battle_of_Gallipoli	Gallipoli Campaign	The Gallipoli Campaign, also known as the Dardanelles Campaign or the Battle of Gallipoli or the Battle of Ã‡anakkale between 25 April 1915 and 9 January 1916, during the First World War. A joint British and French operation was mounted to capture the Ottoman capital of Istanbul (then still referred to as 'Constantinople' by Western nations) and secure a sea route to Russia. The attempt failed, with heavy casualties on both sides. The campaign was considered one of the greatest victories of the Turks and was reflected on as a major failure by the Allies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/G.C._18_March_1915_Gallipoli_Campaign_Article.jpg/250px-G.C._18_March_1915_Gallipoli_Campaign_Article.jpg
