162.0	Manufacturing	Manufacturing	Manufacturing is the use of machines, tools and labor to produce goods for use or sale. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such finished goods may be used for manufacturing other, more complex products, such as aircraft, household appliances or automobiles, or sold to wholesalers, who in turn sell them to retailers, who then sell them to end users â€“ the "consumers".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Product%E2%80%99s_lifecycle.svg/350px-Product%E2%80%99s_lifecycle.svg.png
