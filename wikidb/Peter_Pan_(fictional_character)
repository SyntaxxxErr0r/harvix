2.00	Peter_Pan_(fictional_character)	Peter Pan	Peter Pan is a character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie. A mischievous boy who can fly and who never ages, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood adventuring on the small island of Neverland as the leader of his gang the Lost Boys, interacting with mermaids, Native Americans, fairies, pirates, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside of Neverland. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Peter_pan_1911_pipes.jpg/200px-Peter_pan_1911_pipes.jpg
