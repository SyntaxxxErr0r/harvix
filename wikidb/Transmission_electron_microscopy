62.2	Transmission_electron_microscopy	Transmission electron microscopy	Transmission electron microscopy is a microscopy technique whereby a beam of electrons is transmitted through an ultra thin specimen, interacting with the specimen as it passes through. An image is formed from the interaction of the electrons transmitted through the specimen; the image is magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen, on a layer of photographic film, or to be detected by a sensor such as a CCD camera.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Polio_EM_PHIL_1875_lores.PNG/220px-Polio_EM_PHIL_1875_lores.PNG
