60.4	Trick-or-treating	Trick-or-treating	Trick-or-treating or "Guising", is a customary practice for children on Halloween in many countries. Children in costumes travel from house to house in order to ask for treats such as candy (or, in some cultures, money) with the question "Trick or treat?". The "trick" is a (usually idle) threat to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Trick_or_Treater.jpg/220px-Trick_or_Treater.jpg
