64.0	Arctic_Ocean	Arctic Ocean	The Arctic Ocean, located in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Arctic north polar region, is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceanic divisions. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it as one of the mediterranean seas of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/IBCAO_betamap.jpg/300px-IBCAO_betamap.jpg
