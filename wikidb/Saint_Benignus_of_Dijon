2.00	Saint_Benignus_of_Dijon	Benignus of Dijon	Saint Benignus of Dijon (in French, Saint BÃ©nigne) was a martyr honored as the patron saint and first herald of Christianity of Dijon, Burgundy (Roman Divio). His feast falls, with All Saints, on November 1; his name stands under this date in the Martyrology of St. Jerome. No particulars concerning the person and life of Benignus were known at Dijon. He may have been a missionary priest from Lyon, martyred at Epagny under Aurelian (ruled 270-75), near Dijon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Cath%C3%A9drale_St_B%C3%A9nigne_-_Dijon.jpg/170px-Cath%C3%A9drale_St_B%C3%A9nigne_-_Dijon.jpg
