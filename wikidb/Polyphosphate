13.60	Polyphosphate	Polyphosphate	The structure of tripolyphosphoric acid illustrates the principles which define the structures of polyphosphates. It consists of three tetrahedral PO4 units linked together by sharing oxygen atoms. Structurally, the outer tetrahedra share one vertex with the central tetrahedron; the central tetrahedron shares two corners with the other tetrahedra. The corresponding phosphates are related to the acids by loss of the acidic protons. In the case of the cyclic trimer each tetrahedron shares two vertices with adjacent tetrahedra.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Triphosphors%C3%A4ure.svg/220px-Triphosphors%C3%A4ure.svg.png
