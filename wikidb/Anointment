8.20	Anointment	Anointing	To anoint is to pour or smear with perfumed oil, milk, water, melted butter or other substances, a process employed ritually by many religions. People and things are anointed to symbolize the introduction of a sacramental or divine influence, a holy emanation, spirit, power or God. It can also be seen as a spiritual mode of ridding persons and things of dangerous influences, as of demons (Persian drug, Greek κηρες Keres, Armenian dev) believed to be or to cause disease.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Paris_psaulter_gr139_fol3v.jpg/220px-Paris_psaulter_gr139_fol3v.jpg
