1.00	Plantpot	Flower pot	A flower pot (or plant pot) is a container such as a pot in which flowers and other plants are cultivated. Historically, and still to a significant extent today, they are made from terracotta. Flower pots are now often made from plastic, wood, stone, or sometimes biodegradable material. An example of biodegradable pots are the so-called "Jiffy" pots. Often there are holes in the bottom, to allow excess water to flow out, sometimes to a saucer that is placed under the flower pot. The plant can use this water with its roots, as needed. Recently, some flower pots have been made with an automatic watering system, using a reservoir.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Flowerpot_1.jpg/200px-Flowerpot_1.jpg
