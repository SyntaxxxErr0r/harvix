He held the rank of Staff Officer and served as the unit's treasurer. He was implicated by journalist and author Joe Tiernan in the killing of Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) corporal and alleged Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) member Robert McConnell. Ten days after the purported killing, Cleary himself was shot dead by the SAS after being arrested at the home of his girlfriend outside Forkhill. He was the first person in Northern Ireland to be killed by the SAS, following their full deployment to Northern Ireland in January 1976. According to the SAS, he was shot after attempting to take the rifle from the officer who was guarding him in a bid to escape.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9d/Peter_Cleary.jpg/150px-Peter_Cleary.jpg
