1.00	AAA_Americas_Trios_Championship	AAA Americas Trios Championship	The AAA Americas Trios Championship was a six-man tag team title contested for in the Mexican lucha libre promotion Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA). The last recorded title defense for Los Villaños was in 1997, no official announcement has been made but the title has quietly been eliminated at some point after 1997 when Los Villaños stopped working for AAA. Being a professional wrestling championship, it was not won legitimately: it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline.
