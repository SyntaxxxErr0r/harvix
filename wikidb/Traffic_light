56.7	Traffic_light	Traffic light	Traffic lights, which may also be known as stoplights, traffic lamps, traffic signals, signal lights, robots or semaphore, are signalling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings and other locations to control competing flows of traffic. Traffic lights were first installed in 1868 in London, and today are installed in most cities around the world. Traffic lights alternate the right of way of road users by displaying lights of a standard colour (red, yellow/amber, and green), using a universal color code (and a precise sequence to enable comprehension by those who are color blind).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Modern_British_LED_Traffic_Light.jpg/220px-Modern_British_LED_Traffic_Light.jpg
