56.6	Space_Shuttle_Enterprise	Space Shuttle Enterprise	The Space Shuttle Enterprise was the first Space Shuttle orbiter. It was built for NASA as part of the Space Shuttle program to perform test flights in the atmosphere. It was constructed without engines or a functional heat shield, and was therefore not capable of spaceflight. On September 17, 1976 the first full scale prototype was completed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Space_Shuttle_Enterprise_in_launch_configuration.jpg/200px-Space_Shuttle_Enterprise_in_launch_configuration.jpg
