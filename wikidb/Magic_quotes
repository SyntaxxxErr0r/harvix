10.63	Magic_quotes	Magic quotes	Magic quotes is a controversial feature of the PHP scripting language, wherein special characters are prepended with a backslash before being passed on. It was introduced to help newcomers write functioning SQL commands without requiring manual escaping. It was later described and widely misinterpreted as help to prevent inexperienced developers from writing code which is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This feature is officially deprecated as of PHP 5.3.0, and removed in PHP 5.4 due to security concerns.
