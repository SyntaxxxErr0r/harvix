152.2	Trade_union	Trade union	A trade union , labour union (Canadian English) or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers that have banded together to achieve common goals such as better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common, but by no means only, purpose of these organizations is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/1912_Lawrence_Textile_Strike_1.jpg/300px-1912_Lawrence_Textile_Strike_1.jpg
