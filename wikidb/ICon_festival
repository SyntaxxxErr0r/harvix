1.00	ICon_festival	ICon festival	ICon is an Israeli Science Fiction and Fantasy fan convention held annually in the Tel Aviv Cinemateque during the Sukkot holiday. The name ICon is a shortening of the phrase Israeli Convention. The first ICon was held in 1998 and was presented as a convention. The earlier ICons lasted for 3 days each, but with the increasing demand, they started lengthening, and to attract more people, it was changed from convention to festival. However, the name ICon remained. ICon 2006 was 5 days long and held about 5000 visitors every day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Ikon-Powers.jpg/200px-Ikon-Powers.jpg
