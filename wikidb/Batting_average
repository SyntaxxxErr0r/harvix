67.5	Batting_average	Batting average	In cricket, a player's batting average is the total number of runs he has scored divided by the number of times he has been out. Since the number of runs a player scores and how often he gets out are primarily measures of his own playing ability, and largely independent of his team mates, batting average is a good metric for an individual player's skill as a batsman. The number is also simple to interpret intuitively, being approximately the average number of runs the batsman scores per inning. Batting average has been used to gauge cricket players' relative skills since the 18th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CricketBattingAverageHistogram.gif
