1.00	Epson_PX-4	Epson PX-4	The Epson PX-4 (HC-40 or HX-40) is a portable CP/M based computer introduced in 1985. The screen was 40×8 characters physical, but 80×25 or 40×50 virtual, making it almost compatible with the Epson PX-8 Geneva. It was operated from a NiCD battery pack or four penlight batteries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/EpsonPX-4_300x225.jpg
