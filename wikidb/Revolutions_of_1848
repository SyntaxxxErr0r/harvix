73.8	Revolutions_of_1848	Revolutions of 1848	The European Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the Spring of Nations, Springtime of the Peoples or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. It was the first (and only) Europe-wide collapse of traditional authority, but within a year reactionary forces had won out and the revolutions collapsed. This revolutionary wave began in France in February, and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America. Over 50 countries were affected, but there was no coordination or cooperation among the revolutionaries in different countries. Five factors were involved: the widespread dissatisfaction with the political leadership; the demand for more participation and democracy; the demands of the working classes; the upsurge of nationalism; and finally, the regrouping of the reactionary forces based in the royalty, the aristocracy, the army, and the peasants. The uprisings were led by shaky ad-hoc coalitions of reformers, the middle classes and workers, but it could not hold together for long. Tens of thousands of people were killed and many more forced into exile. The only significant lasting reforms were the abolition of serfdom in Austria and Hungary and the end of absolute monarchy in Denmark. The revolutions were most important in France, Germany, Italy, and Austria, and did not reach Russia, Great Britain, Spain, Sweden, Portugal, or the Ottoman Empire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Horace_Vernet-Barricade_rue_Soufflot.jpg/220px-Horace_Vernet-Barricade_rue_Soufflot.jpg
