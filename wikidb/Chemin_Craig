1.00	Chemin_Craig	Chemin Craig	At the turn of the 19th century, in Lower Canada, nearly all of the population lived in communities along the St. Lawrence River. The land between the river and the U.S. border had been surveyed and was ready for settlement. In 1810, governor James Henry Craig authorized construction of a road to link Quebec and Boston in the U.S. He also wanted to promote colonization of the Eastern Townships by anglophones. His ultimate goal was to assimilate the French Canadian population. The planned route went from Saint-Gilles to Richmond, where an existing road (modern-day Quebec Route 143) continued to the American border.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Diligence_Chemin_Craig_1811.GIF/400px-Diligence_Chemin_Craig_1811.GIF
