74.6	Roger_Bacon	Roger Bacon	Roger Bacon, O.F.M. (c. 1214â€“1294), (scholastic accolade Doctor Mirabilis, meaning "wonderful teacher"), was an English philosopher and Franciscan friar who placed considerable emphasis on the study of nature through empirical methods. He is sometimes credited, mainly starting in the 19th century, as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method inspired by the works of Aristotle and later pseudo-Aristotelian works, like the works of Egyptian scientist Alhazen. However, more recent reevaluations emphasize that he was essentially a medieval thinker, with much of his "experimental" knowledge obtained from books, in the scholastic tradition. A survey of the reception of Bacon's work over centuries found that it often reflects the concerns and controversies central to the receivers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Roger-bacon-statue.jpg/220px-Roger-bacon-statue.jpg
