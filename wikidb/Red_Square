70.7	Red_Square	Red Square	Red Square is a city square in Moscow, Russia. The square separates the Kremlin, the former royal citadel and currently the official residence of the President of Russia, from a historic merchant quarter known as Kitai-gorod. As major streets of Moscow radiate from here in all directions, being promoted to major highways outside the city, Red Square is often considered the central square of Moscow and all of Russia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/RedSquare_%28pixinn.net%29.jpg/325px-RedSquare_%28pixinn.net%29.jpg
