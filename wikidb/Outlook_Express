51.6	Outlook_Express	Outlook Express	Outlook Express is an email and news client that is included with Internet Explorer versions 4.0 through 6.0. As such, it is also bundled with several versions of Microsoft Windows, from Windows 98 to Windows Server 2003, and is available for Windows 3.x, Windows NT 3.51, Windows 95 and Mac OS 9. In Windows Vista, Outlook Express was superseded by Windows Mail, then again by Windows Live Mail as separate software in Windows 7. Microsoft Entourage, sold as part of Microsoft Office for Macintosh, has replaced the Macintosh version.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d2/Outlook_Express_XP.png/300px-Outlook_Express_XP.png
