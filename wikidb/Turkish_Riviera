The combination of a favorable climate, warm sea, more than a thousand kilometers of shoreline along the Aegean and Mediterranean waters, and abundant natural and archeological points of interest makes this stretch of Turkey’s coastline a popular national and international tourist destination.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/TurkishRivieraMap1.png/300px-TurkishRivieraMap1.png
