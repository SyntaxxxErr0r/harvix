69.9	Algae_fuel	Algae fuel	Butanol can be made from algae or diatoms using only a solar powered biorefinery. This fuel has an energy density 10% less than gasoline, and greater than that of either ethanol or methanol. In most gasoline engines, butanol can be used in place of gasoline with no modifications. In several tests, butanol consumption is similar to that of gasoline, and when blended with gasoline, provides better performance and corrosion resistance than that of ethanol or E85.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Sugar_cane_leaves.jpg/120px-Sugar_cane_leaves.jpg
