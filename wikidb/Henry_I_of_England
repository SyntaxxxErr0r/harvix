60.7	Henry_I_of_England	Henry I of England	Henry I (c. 1068/1069 – 1 December 1135) was the fourth son of William I of England. He succeeded his elder brother William II as King of England in 1100 and defeated his eldest brother, Robert Curthose, to become Duke of Normandy in 1106. A later tradition called him Beauclerc for his scholarly interests— he could read Latin and put his learning to effective use— and Lion of Justice for refinements which he brought about in the royal administration, which he rendered the most effective in Europe, rationalizing the itinerant court, and his public espousal of the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Bayeux_Tapestry_WillelmDux.jpg/200px-Bayeux_Tapestry_WillelmDux.jpg
