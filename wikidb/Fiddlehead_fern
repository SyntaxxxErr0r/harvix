51.1	Fiddlehead_fern	Fiddlehead fern	Fiddleheads or Fiddlehead greens are the furled fronds of a young fern, harvested for use as a vegetable. Left on the plant, each fiddlehead would unroll into a new frond . As fiddleheads are harvested early in the season before the frond has opened and reached its full height, they are cut fairly close to the ground.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Pan_Roasted_Chicken_Breasts%2C_Garlic_Mashed_Potatoes%2C_Fiddlehead_Ferns_and_Sauce_Supreme.jpg/220px-Pan_Roasted_Chicken_Breasts%2C_Garlic_Mashed_Potatoes%2C_Fiddlehead_Ferns_and_Sauce_Supreme.jpg
