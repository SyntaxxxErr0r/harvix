20.42	Green-winged_Teal	Green-winged Teal	The Green-winged Teal is a common and widespread duck that breeds in the northern areas of North America except on the Aleutian Islands. It was considered conspecific with the Common Teal (A. crecca) for some time but the issue is still being reviewed by the American Ornithologists' Union; based on this the IUCN and BirdLife International do not accept it as a separate species at present. However, nearly all other authorities consider it distinct based on behavioral, morphological, and molecular evidence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Green-Winged_Teal.jpg/220px-Green-Winged_Teal.jpg
