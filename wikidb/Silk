120.3	Silk	Silk	Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles. The best-known type of silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity . The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fiber, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Meyers_b14_s0826a.jpg/220px-Meyers_b14_s0826a.jpg
