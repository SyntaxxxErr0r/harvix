55.4	Memory_hole	Memory hole	A memory hole is any mechanism for the alteration or disappearance of inconvenient or embarrassing documents, photographs, transcripts, or other records, such as from a web site or other archive, particularly as part of an attempt to give the impression that something never happened. The concept was first popularized by George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Redacted777.jpg/100px-Redacted777.jpg
