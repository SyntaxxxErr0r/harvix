1.21	Pirandamine	Pirandamine	Pirandamine is a tricyclic derivative which acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It was investigated in the 1970s as a potential antidepressant but clinical development wasn't commenced and it was never marketed. Pirandamine is structurally related to tandamine, which, in contrast, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Pirandamine.png/220px-Pirandamine.png
