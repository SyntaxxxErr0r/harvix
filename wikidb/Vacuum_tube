108.6	Vacuum_tube	Vacuum tube	In electronics, a vacuum tube, electron tube (in North America), thermionic valve "tube" or "valve", is a device that controls or regulates the flow of electric current through a vacuum. Vacuum tubes may be used for rectification, amplification, switching, or similar processing or creation of electrical signals. Vacuum tubes rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or hot cathode. Electrons travel to the anode (or plate) when it is at a positive voltage with respect to the cathode. Additional electrodes interposed between the cathode and anode can regulate the current, giving the tube the ability to amplify or switch	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Elektronenroehren-auswahl.jpg/400px-Elektronenroehren-auswahl.jpg
