1.00	Barlow,_Pennsylvania	Barlow, Pennsylvania	Barlow, Pennsylvania is a populated place between the Gettysburg Battlefield and the Mason-Dixon Line at the intersection of Rock Creek and Pennsylvania Route 134. North of the creek on the road summit is the principal facility of the rural community: the 1939 community hall at the Barlow Volunteer Fire Company fire station. The hall is a Cumberland Township polling place and was used by Mamie &amp; Dwight D. Eisenhower after purchasing their nearby farm (President Eisenhower became an honorary company member in 1955). Horner's Mill was the site of an 1861 Union Civil War encampment, and the covered bridge was used by the II Corps (Union Army) and General George G. Meade en route to the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Gettysburg_Topographical_Map.jpg/220px-Gettysburg_Topographical_Map.jpg
