3.00	Sooke_Flowline	Sooke Flowline	The Sooke Flowline is an abandoned 44-kilometre (27 mi) concrete aqueduct that snakes through the Sooke Hills from Sooke Lake to the Humpback Reservoir near Mt. Wells Regional Park. From this reservoir, a buried, riveted steel pressure main transported water to Victoria. In between 1994 and 2007, this main was replaced since it was long past its useful life. The flowline was vital to the continued growth of the City of Victoria as it provided a reliable water supply.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Pipeview.JPG/250px-Pipeview.JPG
