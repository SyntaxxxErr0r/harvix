100.2	Solar_eclipse	Solar eclipse	As seen from the Earth, a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth, and the Moon fully or partially blocks the Sun. This can happen only during a new moon, when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses only part of the Sun is obscured.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Solar_eclipse_1999_4_NR.jpg/220px-Solar_eclipse_1999_4_NR.jpg
