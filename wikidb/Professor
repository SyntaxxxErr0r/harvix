155.4	Professor	Professor	A professor is a scholarly teacher; the precise meaning of the term varies by country. Literally, professor derives from Latin as a "person who professes" being usually an expert in arts or sciences; a teacher of high rank. In much of the world, including German-speaking and northern Europe, and most Commonwealth nations (such as the United Kingdom), professor is reserved only for the most senior academics holding a departmental chair (especially head of the department) at a university, or an awarded chair specifically bestowed recognizing an individual at a university. A Professor is a highly accomplished and recognized academic, and the title may be awarded only after decades of scholarly work. In the United States and Canada, however, the title of professor is granted to larger groups of senior teachers in two- and four-year colleges and universities, and used in the titles Assistant Professor and Associate Professor which are not considered Professor-level positions elsewhere.
