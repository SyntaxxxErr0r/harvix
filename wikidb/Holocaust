238.9	Holocaust	The Holocaust	The Holocaust (from the Greek : hólos, "whole" and kaustós, "burnt"), also known as the Shoah (Hebrew: , HaShoah, "catastrophe"; Yiddish: , Churben or Hurban, from the Hebrew for "destruction"), was the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II, a programme of systematic state-sponsored murder by Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, throughout Nazi-occupied territory. Of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe before the Holocaust, approximately two-thirds perished. In particular, over one million Jewish children were killed in the Holocaust, as were approximately two million Jewish women and three million Jewish men.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Selection_Birkenau_ramp.jpg/350px-Selection_Birkenau_ramp.jpg
