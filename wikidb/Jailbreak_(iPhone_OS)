73.2	Jailbreak_(iPhone_OS)	iOS jailbreaking	One of the main reasons for jailbreaking is to expand the feature set limited by Apple and its App Store. Most jailbreaking tools automatically install Cydia, a native iOS APT client used for finding and installing software for jailbroken iOS devices. Since software programs available through Cydia are not required to adhere to App Store guidelines, many of them are not typical self-contained apps but instead are extensions and customizations for iOS and other apps. Users install these programs for purposes including personalization and customization of the interface, adding desired features and fixing annoyances, and making development work on the device easier by providing access to the filesystem and command-line tools.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Cydia_Tweaks_section.png/220px-Cydia_Tweaks_section.png
