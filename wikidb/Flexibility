30.37	Flexibility	Stiffness	Stiffness or flexibility is the pliability or rigidity of an object â€” the extent to which it resists bending. They are complementary concepts so the more flexible an object is, the less stiff it is.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Beam_Bending.gif/220px-Beam_Bending.gif
