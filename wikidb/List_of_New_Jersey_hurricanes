3.60	List_of_New_Jersey_hurricanes	List of New Jersey hurricanes	A New Jersey hurricane is a tropical cyclone originating in the Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10 years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Hurricane_Gloria1985.jpg/250px-Hurricane_Gloria1985.jpg
