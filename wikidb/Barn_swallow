It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the Swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a "swallow" rather than a "martin".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Landsvale.jpg/220px-Landsvale.jpg
