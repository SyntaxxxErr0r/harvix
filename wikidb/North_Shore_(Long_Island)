23.73	North_Shore_(Long_Island)	North Shore (Long Island)	The North Shore of Long Island is the area along Long Island's northern coast, bordering Long Island Sound. The region has long been the most affluent on Long Island, as well as the most affluent in the New York metropolitan area, which has earned it the nickname "the Gold Coast." Though some consider the North Shore to include parts of Queens, particularly the quasi-suburban northeastern neighborhoods such as Douglaston, the term is generally used to refer to the Long Island coastline in the towns of North Hempstead, Oyster Bay, and Huntington, in Nassau and Suffolk County.
