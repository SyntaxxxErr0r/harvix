65.4	Black_Dahlia	Black Dahlia	"The Black Dahlia" was a nickname given to Elizabeth Short (July 29, 1924 â€“ January 15, 1947), an American woman who was the victim of a gruesome and much-publicized murder. Short acquired the moniker posthumously by newspapers in the habit of nicknaming crimes they found particularly colorful. Short was found mutilated, her body sliced in half at the waist, on January 15, 1947, in Leimert Park, Los Angeles, California. Short's unsolved murder has been the source of widespread speculation, leading to many suspects, along with several books and film adaptations of the story.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Black_Dahlia.jpg
