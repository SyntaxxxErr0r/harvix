1.00	Talk%3ATheodosius_I	Talk:Theodosius I	==Nicene Christianity becomes the state religion== "Theodosius promoted Nicene Trinitarian Christianity within the Empire. On 27 February 380, he declared "Catholic Church" the only legitimate Imperial religion, ending official state support for the traditional religion." This could be misleading as it leads one to erroneously suppose the present Roman Catholic Church is meant. The term 'Catholic Church' at that time consisted of what we now know to be the Orthodox East and Catholic West prior to the schism. It would be in the interests of clarity to change this to "he declared that Christianity the only legitimate Imperial religion".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Akropolis-detail.jpg/120px-Akropolis-detail.jpg
