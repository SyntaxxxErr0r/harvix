The series centers on Dexter Morgan , a blood spatter pattern analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department who moonlights as a serial killer. Set in Miami, the show's first season was largely based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay, the first of his Dexter series novels. Subsequent seasons have evolved independently of Lindsay's works; several are based on short stories by Lindsay's friend, Stephen R. Pastore. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the first episode.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c0/Dexter_TV_Series_Title_Card.jpg/250px-Dexter_TV_Series_Title_Card.jpg
