80.4	Hutong	Hutong	Hutongs are a type of narrow streets or alleys, most commonly associated with Beijing, China. In Beijing, hutongs are alleys formed by lines of siheyuan, traditional courtyard residences. Many neighbourhoods were formed by joining one siheyuan to another to form a hutong, and then joining one hutong to another. The word hutong is also used to refer to such neighbourhoods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Beijing_hutong_area_3.jpg/200px-Beijing_hutong_area_3.jpg
