2.00	Web_clique	Webring	A webring (or web ring) is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social. They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites, but have since fallen out of general use and become rare.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/YAHOO_headquarters.jpg/190px-YAHOO_headquarters.jpg
