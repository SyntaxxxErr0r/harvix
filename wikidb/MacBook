137.9	MacBook	MacBook	The MacBook is a brand of Macintosh notebook computers manufactured by Apple Inc. from 2006 to 2010. It replaced the iBook and 12-inch PowerBook series of notebooks as a part of the Appleâ€“Intel transition. Positioned as the low end of the MacBook family, the Apple MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets. It was the best-selling Macintosh in history, and according to the sales-research organization NPD Group in October 2008, the mid-range model of the MacBook was the single best-selling laptop of any brand in U.S. retail stores for the preceding five months.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/MacBook_white.png/225px-MacBook_white.png
