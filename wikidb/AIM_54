1.00	AIM_54	AIM-54 Phoenix	The AIM-54 Phoenix is a radar-guided, long-range air-to-air missile (AAM), carried in clusters of up to six missiles on F-14 Tomcats, its only launch platform. The Phoenix was the United States' only long-range air-to-air missile. The weapons system based on Phoenix was the world's first to allow simultaneous guidance of missiles against multiple targets. Both the missile and the aircraft was used by the United States Navy and are now retired, the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004 and the F-14 in 2006. They were replaced by shorter-range AIM-120 AMRAAMs, employed on the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Following the retirement of the F-14 by the U.S., the weapon's only current operator is Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/AIM-54_6_Pack.jpg/300px-AIM-54_6_Pack.jpg
