93.9	X86-64	x86-64	x86-64 is an extension of the x86 instruction set. It supports vastly larger virtual and physical address spaces than are possible on x86, thereby allowing programmers to conveniently work with much larger data sets. x86-64 also provides 64-bit general purpose registers and numerous other enhancements. The original specification was created by AMD, and has been implemented by AMD, Intel, VIA, and others. It is fully backwards compatible with 32-bit code.(p13) Because the full 32-bit instruction set remains implemented in hardware without any intervening emulation, existing 32-bit x86 executables run with no compatibility or performance penalties, although existing applications that are recoded to take advantage of new features of the processor design may see performance increases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/AMD64_Logo.svg/150px-AMD64_Logo.svg.png
