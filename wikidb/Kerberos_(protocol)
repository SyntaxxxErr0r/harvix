145.8	Kerberos_(protocol)	Kerberos (protocol)	Kerberos ( ) is a computer network authentication protocol which works on the basis of "tickets" to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. Its designers aimed primarily at a client–server model, and it provides mutual authentication—both the user and the server verify each other's identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks. Kerberos builds on symmetric key cryptography and requires a trusted third party, and optionally may use public-key cryptography by utilizing asymmetric key cryptography during certain phases of authentication. Kerberos uses port 88 by default.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Kerberos.svg/220px-Kerberos.svg.png
