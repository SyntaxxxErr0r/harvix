60.7	Fixed-wing_aircraft	Fixed-wing aircraft	A fixed-wing aircraft is an aircraft capable of flight using wings that generate lift due to the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft in which wings rotate about a fixed mast and ornithopters in which lift is generated by flapping wings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Tarom.b737-700.yr-bgg.arp.jpg/300px-Tarom.b737-700.yr-bgg.arp.jpg
