64.0	Living_Colour	Living Colour	Living Colour is an American rock band from New York City, formed in 1984. Stylistically, the band's music is a creative fusion influenced by free jazz, funk, neo-psychedelia, hard rock, and heavy metal. Their lyrics range from the personal to the political, in some of the latter cases attacking Eurocentrism and racism in America.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Loz_livingcolour_mmm.png/250px-Loz_livingcolour_mmm.png
