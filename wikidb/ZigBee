113.8	ZigBee	ZigBee	ZigBee is a specification for a suite of high level communication protocols using small, low-power digital radios based on an IEEE 802 standard for personal area networks. Applications include wireless light switches, electrical meters with in-home-displays, and other consumer and industrial equipment that requires short-range wireless transfer of data at relatively low rates. The technology defined by the ZigBee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other WPANs, such as Bluetooth. ZigBee is targeted at radio-frequency (RF) applications that require a low data rate, long battery life, and secure networking. ZigBee has a defined rate of 250 kbps best suited for periodic or intermittent data or a single signal transmission from a sensor or input device. ZigBee based traffic management system have also been implemented. The name refers to the waggle dance of honey bees after their return to the beehive.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Eazix_numbered.jpg/220px-Eazix_numbered.jpg
