4.20	1,1-Difluoroethane	1,1-Difluoroethane	1,1-Difluoroethane is an organofluorine compound with the chemical formula C2H4F2. This colorless gas is used as a refrigerant, where it is often listed as R-152a or HFC-152a. As an alternative to chlorofluorocarbons, it has an ozone depletion potential of zero, a lower global warming potential (120) and a shorter atmospheric lifetime (1.4 years). It has recently been approved for use in automobile applications as an alternative to R-134a.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Difluoroethane3D.png/160px-Difluoroethane3D.png
