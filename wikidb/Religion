261.6	Religion	Religion	Religion is a collection of cultural systems, belief systems, and worldviews that establishes symbols that relate humanity to spirituality and, sometimes, to moral values. Many religions have narratives, symbols, traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the universe. They tend to derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Religious_syms.svg/250px-Religious_syms.svg.png
