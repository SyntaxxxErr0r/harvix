54.6	Louis_Braille	Louis Braille	Louis Braille (4 January 1809 – 6 January 1852) was the inventor of braille,a a system of reading and writing used by people who are blind or visually impaired. As a small child, Braille was blinded in an accident; as a boy he developed a mastery over that blindness; and as a young man – still a student at school – he created a revolutionary form of communication that transcended blindness and transformed the lives of millions. After two centuries, the braille system remains an invaluable tool of learning and communication for the blind, and it has been adapted for languages worldwide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Louis_Braille_by_%C3%89tienne_Leroux.jpg/235px-Louis_Braille_by_%C3%89tienne_Leroux.jpg
