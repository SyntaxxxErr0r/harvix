2.00	Dihalo_addition_reaction	Halogen addition reaction	The atom is electrophilic at this time and is attacked by the pi electrons of the alkene . It forms for an instant a single sigma bond to both of the carbon atoms involved. The bonding of bromine is special in this intermediate, due to its relatively large size compared to carbon, the bromide ion is capable to interacting with both carbons which once shared the Ï€-bond, making a three-membered ring. The bromide ion acquires a positive formal charge. At this moment the halogen ion is called a "bromonium ion" or "chloronium ion", respectively.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Alkene-bromine-addition-2D-skeletal.png/400px-Alkene-bromine-addition-2D-skeletal.png
