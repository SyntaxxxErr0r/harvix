1.00	Leg_trip	Takedown (grappling)	A takedown is a martial arts and combat sports term for a technique that involves off-balancing an opponent and bringing him or her to the ground, typically with the combatant performing the takedown landing on top. The process of quickly advancing on an opponent and attempting a takedown is known as shooting for a takedown, or simply shooting. Takedowns are usually distinguished from throws by the forward motion and target of advancement (typically the legs), the terms are used interchangeably for techniques. Takedowns are featured in all forms of wrestling and stand-up grappling.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Single_leg_takedown.jpg/220px-Single_leg_takedown.jpg
