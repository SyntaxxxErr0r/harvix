8.30	Weaver_(occupation)	Weaving	Weaving is a method of fabric production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. The other methods are knitting, lace making and felting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling. The method in which these threads are inter woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Plain_Weaving_Detail.JPG/220px-Plain_Weaving_Detail.JPG
