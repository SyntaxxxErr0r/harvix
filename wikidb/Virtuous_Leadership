Virtuous Leadership has been translated into 13 languages including Russian, Chinese, French and Spanish. As such, some commentators have called it the first systematic and holistic attempt to relate the classical virtues to professional leadership in modern times.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Virtuous_Leadership_cover.jpg
