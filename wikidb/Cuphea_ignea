3.00	Cuphea_ignea	Cuphea ignea	Cuphea ignea, also known as the Cigar plant, Cigar flower, Firecracker plant, or Mexican Cigar, is a tropical, perennial, densely-branched evergreen sub-shrub. This species, native to Mexico and the West Indies, produces small, tubular, bright red to orange flowers. Each flower is tipped with a thin, white rim and two small purple-black petals. The flowers are considered to resemble a lit cigar, hence the name. The leaves are small, elliptical and of a bright green colour. This bushy shrub grows to about 60 cm. The name 'ignea' comes from the Latin word for fire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Cuphea_ignea1.jpg/220px-Cuphea_ignea1.jpg
