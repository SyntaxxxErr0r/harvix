85.6	Pasta	Pasta	Pasta is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, with the first reference dating back to 1154. It is also commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes and a national Holiday in Italy. Most typically pasta is made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked and served in any number of dishes. It can be made with flour from other cerals or grains and eggs can be used instead of water. Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried and fresh (pasta fresca). Chicken eggs frequently dominate as the source of the liquid component in fresh pasta.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Pasta_Venice.jpg/239px-Pasta_Venice.jpg
