51.9	Michel_Houellebecq	Michel Houellebecq	Michel Houellebecq , born Michel Thomas, 26 February 1958—or 1956 (birth certificate)—on the French island of Réunion, is a controversial and award-winning French author, filmmaker and poet. To admirers he is a writer in the tradition of literary provocation that reaches back to the Marquis de Sade and Baudelaire; to detractors he is a peddler of sleaze and shock. Having written poetry and a biography of the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft he brought out his first novel Extension du domaine de la lutte in 1994. Les Particules élémentaires followed in 1998 and Plateforme in 2001. After a publicity tour for this book, which led to his being taken to court for inciting racial hatred, he went to Ireland to write. He lived in Ireland for several years, and now lives in Spain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/2008.06.09._Michel_Houellebecq_Fot_Mariusz_Kubik_03.jpg/220px-2008.06.09._Michel_Houellebecq_Fot_Mariusz_Kubik_03.jpg
