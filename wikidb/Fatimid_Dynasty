1.10	Fatimid_Dynasty	Fatimid Caliphate	The Fatimid Islamic Caliphate or al-Fāṭimiyyūn (Arabic الفاطميون) was a Shi'a Ismaili Muslim caliphate that spanned a vast area of the Arab World, from the Red Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west. Originally based in Tunisia, the Fatimid dynasty extended their rule across the Mediterranean coast of Africa, and ultimately made Egypt the centre of their caliphate. At its height, in addition to Egypt, the caliphate included varying areas of the Maghreb, Sudan, Sicily, the Levant, and Hijaz.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Fatimid_flag.svg/125px-Fatimid_flag.svg.png
