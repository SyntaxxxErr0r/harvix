66.8	Western_United_States	Western United States	The Western United States, commonly referred to as the American West or simply "the West," traditionally refers to the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States. Because the U.S. expanded westward after its founding, the meaning of the West has evolved over time. Prior to about 1800, the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was seen as the western frontier. Since then, the frontier moved further west and the Mississippi River was referenced as the easternmost possible boundary of the West.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/120px-US_map-West.png/305px-120px-US_map-West.png
