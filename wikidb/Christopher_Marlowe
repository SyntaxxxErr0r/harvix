85.0	Christopher_Marlowe	Christopher Marlowe	Christopher Marlowe (baptised 26 February 1564; died 30 May 1593) was an English dramatist, poet and translator of the Elizabethan era. Marlowe was the foremost Elizabethan tragedian until his mysterious early death. Marlowe greatly influenced William Shakespeare, who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe's death. Marlowe's plays are known for the use of blank verse, and their overreaching protagonists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Portrait_of_Christopher_Marlowe.png/220px-Portrait_of_Christopher_Marlowe.png
