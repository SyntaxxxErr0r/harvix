2.10	Tampere_railway_station	Tampere railway station	The Tampere railway station is a functionalist building in Tampere, Finland, designed by Eero Seppälä and Otto Flodin, completed in 1936. The 36-metre clock tower was later added because the Finnish railway bureau required it (its total height from ground level is about 50 metres). The city's main street Hämeenkatu begins at the railway station, continuing over the Hämeensilta bridge to its western end at the Aleksanteri church. The Itsenäisyydenkatu (originally called Puolimatkankatu) street begins at the Tammela side of the station, continuing to the Kaleva Church.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Tampere_railway_station_in_December.jpg/300px-Tampere_railway_station_in_December.jpg
