186.0	LED	Light-emitting diode	A light-emitting diode is a semiconductor light source. LEDs are used as indicator lamps in many devices and are increasingly used for other lighting. Introduced as a practical electronic component in 1962, early LEDs emitted low-intensity red light, but modern versions are available across the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with very high brightness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/RBG-LED.jpg/235px-RBG-LED.jpg
