6.33	Traveling_Salesman_Problem	Travelling salesman problem	The travelling salesman problem was defined in the 1800s by the Irish mathematician W. R. Hamilton and by the British mathematician Thomas Kirkman. Hamiltonâ€™s Icosian Game was a recreational puzzle based on finding a Hamiltonian cycle. The general form of the TSP appears to have been first studied by mathematicians during the 1930s in Vienna and at Harvard, notably by Karl Menger, who defines the problem, considers the obvious brute-force algorithm, and observes the non-optimality of the nearest neighbour heuristic:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/William_Rowan_Hamilton_painting.jpg/220px-William_Rowan_Hamilton_painting.jpg
