205.4	Johnny_Depp	Johnny Depp	John Christopher "Johnny" Depp II (born June 9, 1963) is an American actor, producer and musician. He has won the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild award for Best Actor. Depp rose to prominence on the 1980s television series, 21 Jump Street, becoming a teen idol. Dissatisfied with that status, Depp turned to film for more challenging roles; he played the title character of Edward Scissorhands (1990) and later found box office success in films such as Sleepy Hollow (1999), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Rango (2011) and the Pirates of the Caribbean film series (2003â€“present). He has collaborated with director and friend Tim Burton in seven films, most recently with Dark Shadows (2012).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/JohnnyDeppByArnoldWells2011.jpg/220px-JohnnyDeppByArnoldWells2011.jpg
