2.00	Silver_sulphide	Silver sulfide	Silver sulfide, Ag2S, is the sulfide of silver. This dense black solid constitutes the tarnish that forms over time on silverware and other silver objects. Silver sulfide is insoluble in all solvents, but is degraded by strong acids. Silver sulfide features a covalent bond, as it is made up of silver (electronegativity of 1.98) and sulfur (electronegativity of 2.58). It is a component of classical qualitative inorganic analysis. When formed on electrical contacts operating in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen sulfide, long filaments known as silver whiskers can form.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Sulfid_st%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Sulfid_st%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%BD.PNG
