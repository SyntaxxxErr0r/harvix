1.00	Chincoteague,_VA	Chincoteague, Virginia	Chincoteague is a town on Chincoteague Island in Accomack County, Virginia, United States. The population was 4,317 at the 2000 census. The town is perhaps best known for the Chincoteague Ponies, although these are not actually on the island of Chincoteague but on nearby Assateague Island. These ponies and the annual Pony Penning Day are the subject of Marguerite Henry's 1947 children's book Misty of Chincoteague. This was made into the 1961 family film Misty, which was filmed on location.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/ChincoteagueFishingBoats.jpg/250px-ChincoteagueFishingBoats.jpg
