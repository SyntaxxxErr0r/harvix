1.00	December_20%E2%80%9321,_2006_Colorado_Blizzard	Colorado Holiday Blizzards (2006â€“2007)	The Holiday Blizzards were major storms occurring in two segments during the last two weeks of December 2006 in the Denver, Colorado area. The blizzards occurred within a week of each other. A subsequent storm, smaller in scope, struck the area less than week after the second blizzard, further hampering removal efforts and travel in the region.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Dec06_storm.gif/500px-Dec06_storm.gif
