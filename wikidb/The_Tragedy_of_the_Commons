7.31	The_Tragedy_of_the_Commons	Tragedy of the commons	The tragedy of the commons is a dilemma arising from the situation in which multiple individuals, acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest, will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource, even when it is clear that it is not in anyone's long-term interest for this to happen. This dilemma was described in an influential article titled "The Tragedy of the Commons", written by ecologist Garrett Hardin and first published in the journal Science in 1968.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Cows_on_Selsley_Common_-_geograph.org.uk_-_192472.jpg/300px-Cows_on_Selsley_Common_-_geograph.org.uk_-_192472.jpg
