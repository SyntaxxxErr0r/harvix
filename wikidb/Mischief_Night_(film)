It is the third installment of the Tina Trilogy following on from Tina Goes Shopping (1999) and Tina Takes a Break (2001). However, unlike the previous two Channel 4 films Mischief Night broadens its scope to consider the wider community that Tina lives in and address issues of racial segregation. Tina is played by Kelli Hollis in all three films.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Mischief_Night_VideoCover.jpeg/220px-Mischief_Night_VideoCover.jpeg
