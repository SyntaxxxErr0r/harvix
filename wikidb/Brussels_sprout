78.5	Brussels_sprout	Brussels sprout	The Brussels sprout is a cultivar of wild cabbage grown for its edible buds. The leafy green vegetables are typically 2.5–4 cm (0.98–1.6 in) in diameter and look like miniature cabbages. The sprout is Brassica oleracea, in the "gemmifera" group of the family Brassicaceae. Although named after the capital of Belgium, few historians believe the plant originated there.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Brussels_sprout_closeup.jpg/240px-Brussels_sprout_closeup.jpg
