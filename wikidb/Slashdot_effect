352.1	Slashdot_effect	Slashdot effect	The Slashdot effect, also known as slashdotting, occurs when a popular website links to a smaller site, causing a massive increase in traffic. This overloads the smaller site, causing it to slow down or even temporarily close. The name stems from the huge influx of web traffic that results from the technology news site Slashdot linking to websites. The effect has been associated with other websites or metablogs such as Fark, Drudge Report, Reddit, Twitter and Digg, leading to terms such as being Farked or Drudged, or being under the Reddit effect. Typically, less robust sites are unable to cope with the huge increase in traffic and become unavailable â€“ common causes are lack of sufficient data bandwidth, servers that fail to cope with the high number of requests, and traffic quotas. Sites that are maintained on shared hosting services often fail when confronted with the Slashdot effect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/SlashdotEffectGraph.svg/220px-SlashdotEffectGraph.svg.png
