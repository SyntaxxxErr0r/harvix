2.00	Pachebel's_Canon	Pachelbel's Canon	Pachelbel's Canon is the most famous piece of music by German Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel. It was originally scored for three violins and basso continuo and paired with a gigue in the same key. Like most other works by Pachelbel and other pre-1700 composers, the Canon remained forgotten for centuries and was rediscovered only in the 20th century. Several decades after it was first published in 1919, the piece became extremely popular, and today it is frequently played at weddings and included on classical music compilations, along with other famous Baroque pieces such as Air on the G String by Johann Sebastian Bach.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Pachelbel-canon-colors.png/400px-Pachelbel-canon-colors.png
