6.10	2011_Nakba_Day	2011 Nakba Day	Inspired by the uprisings and revolutions taking place in the Arab world, Palestinians used Facebook to call for mass protests throughout the region on May 15, 2011, Nakba Day. A page calling for a "Third Palestinian Intifada" to begin on May 15 garnered more than 350,000 "likes" before being taken down by Facebook managers at the end of March after complaints from the Israeli government as well as a counter group which repeatedly requested Facebook to block the page on the grounds that it incited violence. The page called for mass marches to Palestine from Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan to commemorate the Nakba and demand the right of return for all Palestinian refugees.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Free_Palestine_rally_in_Cairo.jpg/220px-Free_Palestine_rally_in_Cairo.jpg
