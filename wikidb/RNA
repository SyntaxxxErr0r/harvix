225.7	RNA	RNA	Ribonucleic acid essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is made up of a long chain of components called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a nucleobase, a ribose sugar, and a phosphate group. The sequence of nucleotides allows RNA to encode genetic information. All cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to carry the genetic information that directs the synthesis of proteins. In addition, many viruses use RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Pre-mRNA-1ysv.png-tubes.png/220px-Pre-mRNA-1ysv.png-tubes.png
