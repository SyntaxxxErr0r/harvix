1.00	Euro-Cents	Euro coins	The obverse side varies from state to state, with each member allowed to choose its own design. Each of the eight coins can have the same design (such as Belgian coins), or can vary from coin to coin (such as Italian coins). In monarchies, the national side usually features a portrait of the country's monarch, often in a design carried over from the former currency (e.g. Belgium). Republics tend to feature national monuments, symbols, or stylised designs (such as French coins). Engravings on the edge of the â‚¬2 coin are also subject to national choice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Eurocent_edges_%282%2C10%2C20%29.jpg/220px-Eurocent_edges_%282%2C10%2C20%29.jpg
