2.00	Thizz_Entertainment	Thizz Entertainment	Thizz Entertainment is a San Francisco Bay Area-based, independent record label, started as Romp Records in 1996 by rapper Mac Dre. When Dre moved to Sacramento in 1999, he changed the label's name to Thizz Entertainment to avoid connections to the Romper Room Gang. Dre thought the name Thizz perfectly expressed how it felt when you were high on ecstasy which was becoming popular in the Bay Area hip hop scene.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Zme5ja.jpg/180px-Zme5ja.jpg
