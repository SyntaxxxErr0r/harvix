89.5	Donner_Party	Donner Party	The Donner Party was a group of 87 American pioneers who set out in a wagon train headed west for California, only to find themselves trapped by snow in the Sierra Nevada. The subsequent casualties were extremely high, and many of the survivors cannibalized members of the party who had already died.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/PatrickBreenDiaryPage28.jpg/220px-PatrickBreenDiaryPage28.jpg
