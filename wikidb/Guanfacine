15.83	Guanfacine	Guanfacine	Guanfacine (brand name Tenex, and the extended release Intuniv) is a sympatholytic. It is a selective α2A receptor agonist. These receptors are concentrated heavily in the prefrontal cortex and the locus coeruleus, with the potential to improve attention abilities via modulating post-synaptic α2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Guanfacine lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by activating the central nervous system α-2a norepinephrine autoreceptors, which results in reduced peripheral sympathetic outflow and thus a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone. Its side-effects are dose dependent, with practically no dryness of the mouth at doses of 2 mg and less.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Guanfacine.svg/220px-Guanfacine.svg.png
