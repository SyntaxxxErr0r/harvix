1.10	L%C3%BCneburg-Celle	Principality of Lüneburg	The Principality of Lüneburg (later also referred to as Celle) was a territorial division of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg within the Holy Roman Empire, immediately subordinate to the emperor. It existed from 1269 until 1705 and its territory lay within the modern-day state of Lower Saxony in Germany. The Principality was named after its first capital, Lüneburg (Lunenburg), which was ruled jointly by all Brunswick-Lüneburg lines until 1637. From 1378, the seat of the Principality was in Celle. It lost its independence in 1705 when it was annexed by the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, but retained its vote in the Reichstag as Brunswick-Celle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Celler_Schloss.png/220px-Celler_Schloss.png
