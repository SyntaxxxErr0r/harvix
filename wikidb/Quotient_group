13.11	Quotient_group	Quotient group	In mathematics, specifically group theory, a quotient group (or factor group) is a group obtained by identifying together elements of a larger group using an equivalence relation. For example, the cyclic group of addition modulo n can be obtained from the integers by identifying elements that differ by a multiple of n and defining a group structure that operates on each such class (known as a congruence class) as a single entity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Normal_subgroup_illustration.png/220px-Normal_subgroup_illustration.png
