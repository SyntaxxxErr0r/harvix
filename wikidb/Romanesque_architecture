56.9	Romanesque_architecture	Romanesque architecture	Romanesque architecture is an architectural style of Medieval Europe characterised by semi-circular arches. There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque architecture, with proposals ranging from the 6th to the 10th century. It developed in the 12th century into the Gothic style, characterised by pointed arches. Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent, making it the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman Architecture. The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as Norman architecture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Se_de_Lisboa_Frente.JPG/220px-Se_de_Lisboa_Frente.JPG
