74.8	Focal_length	Focal length	The focal length of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light. For an optical system in air, it is the distance over which initially collimated rays are brought to a focus. A system with a shorter focal length has greater optical power than one with a long focal length; that is, it bends the rays more strongly, bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Focal-length.svg/180px-Focal-length.svg.png
