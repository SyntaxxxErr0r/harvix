56.1	United_States_embargo_against_Cuba	United States embargo against Cuba	U.S. arms embargo had been in force since March 1958 when armed conflict broke out in Cuba between rebels and the Fulgencio Batista government. In July 1960, in response to Cuba's new revolutionary government's seizure of US properties, the United States reduced the Cuban import quota of brown sugar to 700,000 tons, under the Sugar Act of 1948; the Soviet Union responded by agreeing to purchase the sugar instead, as Cuba's new government continued to take further actions to nationalize American businesses and privately owned properties.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Fidel_Castro_-_UN_General_Assembly_1960.jpg/180px-Fidel_Castro_-_UN_General_Assembly_1960.jpg
