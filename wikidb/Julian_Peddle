1.00	Julian_Peddle	Julian Peddle	In 1997 Peddle took over two former Cambus depots at Huntingdon and Milton Keynes. These had been acquired along with the rest of Cambus by Stagecoach Group in 1995, but the Office of Fair Trading had instructed Stagecoach to sell two depots to reduce its dominance in the region. They also stipulated that both depots must be sold to the same buyer. Peddle proved to be the only interested party and duly took over the operation in June 1997. The operations were quickly rebranded as MK Metro in Milton Keynes and Premier Buses in Huntingdon. However, Peddle was unable to fund new vehicles for both, and sold Premier to Blazefield in 1998.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/MK_Metro_bus_52.jpg/220px-MK_Metro_bus_52.jpg
