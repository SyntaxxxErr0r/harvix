1.00	Richard_Charles_Travis	Richard Travis	Richard Charles Travis VC, DCM, MM (6 April 1884 â€“ 25 July 1918) was a New Zealand soldier who fought during the First World War and was posthumously decorated with the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to Commonwealth forces. Prior to serving in the military Travis worked as a farm hand and horse breaker and was known as being a bit of trouble maker to the extent that he led a rather transient existence after leaving home at the age of 21. During the war he served briefly at Gallipoli before being sent to France where he fought in the trenches along the Western Front, earning a reputation as scout and sniper. He was killed by shellfire a day after performing the deed that led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross.
