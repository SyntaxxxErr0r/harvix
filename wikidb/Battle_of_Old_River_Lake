3.20	Battle_of_Old_River_Lake	Battle of Old River Lake	The Battle of Old River Lake (also called Ditch Bayou, Furlough, and Fish Bayou) was a small skirmish between U.S. Army troops and Confederate troops from June 5 to June 6, 1864, during the American Civil War. A Union Army force marched into Confederate-held lands in Chicot County, Arkansas. The ensuing battle resulted mainly in a stalemate, each side achieving its goals. The Confederate troops succeeded in delaying the Federal forces' advance into the South, while dealing more casualties to the opposing army than they themselves received. Likewise, the Union troops succeeded in advancing toward their goal, Lake Village.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Map_of_Arkansas_highlighting_Chicot_County.svg/200px-Map_of_Arkansas_highlighting_Chicot_County.svg.png
