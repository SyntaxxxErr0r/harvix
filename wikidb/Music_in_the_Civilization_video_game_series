2.00	Music_in_the_Civilization_video_game_series	Music in the Civilization video game series	The music of the computer game Civilization IV features a large variety of tracks both original and historical, from Gregorian chants to modern minimalism, and makes extensive use of classical music as well as both world music and folk music. Such a focus on the soundtrack and the inclusion of classical, world and folk music are rare among games, though relatively common for strategy games. Original music was created for the expansion Civilization IV: Warlords and includes specifically themed music for each of the several scenarios, and several new Leader pieces. Civilization IV: Warlords also uses music from Civilization III to fill out some of the areas overlooked in the original Civilization IV such as music for the "classical" period, and adding eastern music for the Asian scenarios. All tracks are stored on the hard drive in mp3 format, making them perfectly usable outside the game.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e5/Civ_IV_Soundtrack.jpg/220px-Civ_IV_Soundtrack.jpg
