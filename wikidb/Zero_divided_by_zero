1.00	Zero_divided_by_zero	Division by zero	In mathematics, division by zero is division where the divisor (denominator) is zero. Such a division can be formally expressed as a / 0 where a is the dividend (numerator). Whether this expression can be assigned a well-defined value depends upon the mathematical setting. In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, multiplied by 0, gives a (aâ‰ 0), and so we say that division by zero is undefined. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to a / 0 is contained in George Berkeley's criticism of infinitesimal calculus in The Analyst ("ghosts of departed quantities").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Hyperbola_one_over_x.svg/220px-Hyperbola_one_over_x.svg.png
