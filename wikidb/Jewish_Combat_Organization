7.10	Jewish_Combat_Organization	Jewish Combat Organization	The Jewish Combat Organization (Polish: , ŻOB; Yiddish: ) was a World War II resistance movement, which was instrumental in engineering the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. ŻOB took part in a number of other resistance activities as well. Notably, a second Jewish resistance organization called the Jewish Military League (Polish: , ŻZW), formed primarily of former officers of the Polish Army in late 1939—and operating side by side—was at least equally instrumental in the Jewish armed struggle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/AK-soldiers_Parasol_Regiment_Warsaw_Uprising_1944.jpg/136px-AK-soldiers_Parasol_Regiment_Warsaw_Uprising_1944.jpg
