Hashish is often a paste-like substance with varying hardness and pliability, its color most commonly light to dark brown but varying toward green, yellow, black or red.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/American_medical_hashish%2810%29.jpg/180px-American_medical_hashish%2810%29.jpg
