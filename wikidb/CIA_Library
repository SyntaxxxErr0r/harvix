3.00	CIA_Library	CIA Library	The CIA Library, available to Central Intelligence Agency personnel only, contains approximately 125,000 books and subscribes to about 1,700 periodicals. The Library maintains three collectionsâ€”Reference, Circulating, and Historical Intelligence. New material for these collections is selected around current intelligence objectives and priorities. The reference collection includes core research tools such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, commercial directories, atlases, diplomatic lists, and foreign and domestic phone books. CD-ROMs and extensive commercial database services round out the collection. The circulating collection consists of monographs, newspapers, and journals. Many information resources are available to patrons at their desktop via the Digital Library. These include CD-ROMs and web-based resources and are accessible from the library's homepages. The library also participates in inter-library loans of circulating items with other domestic libraries. The Historical Intelligence Collection is primarily an open-source library dedicated to the collection, retention, and exploitation of material dealing with the intelligence profession. Currently there are over 25,000 books and an extensive collection of press clippings on that subject.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Library_cia.jpg/275px-Library_cia.jpg
