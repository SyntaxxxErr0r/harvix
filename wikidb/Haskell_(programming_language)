104.1	Haskell_(programming_language)	Haskell (programming language)	Haskell is a standardized, general-purpose purely functional programming language, with non-strict semantics and strong static typing. It is named after logician Haskell Curry. In Haskell, "a function is a first-class citizen" of the programming language. As a functional programming language, the primary control construct is the function. The language is rooted in the observations of Haskell Curry and his intellectual descendants, that "a proof is a program; the formula it proves is a type for the program".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Haskell-Logo.svg/120px-Haskell-Logo.svg.png
