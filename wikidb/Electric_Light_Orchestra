114.5	Electric_Light_Orchestra	Electric Light Orchestra	Electric Light Orchestra were a British rock group from Birmingham who released eleven studio albums between 1971 and 1986 and another album in 2001. ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. After Wood's departure following the band's debut record, Lynne wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/ELO_-_Time_Tour_81-82.jpg/299px-ELO_-_Time_Tour_81-82.jpg
