2.20	Acotango	Acotango	Volcán Acotango - 6,052 metres (19,856 ft) is the central and highest of a group of stratovolcanoes straddling the border of Bolivia and Chile. The group is known as Nevados de Quimsachata and consists, apart of Acotango, of Volcán Humarata - 5,730 metres (18,799 ft) to its north and Cerro Capurata - 5,990 metres (19,652 ft) on its south. The group lies along a north-south alignment. The Acotango volcano is heavily eroded, but a lava flow on its northern flank is morphologically young, suggesting Acotango was active in the Holocene.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Volcan_Acotango_and_Cerro_Capurata.jpg/280px-Volcan_Acotango_and_Cerro_Capurata.jpg
