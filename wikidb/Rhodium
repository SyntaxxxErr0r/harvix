57.7	Rhodium	Rhodium	Rhodium ( -dee-É™m) is a chemical element that is a rare, silvery-white, hard, and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group. It has the chemical symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is composed of only one isotope, 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and never as a chemical compound. It is one of the rarest precious metals and one of the most costly (gold has since taken over the top spot of cost per ounce).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Rhodium_powder_pressed_melted.jpg/250px-Rhodium_powder_pressed_melted.jpg
