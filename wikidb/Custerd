1.10	Custerd	Transit Kings	The Transit Kings are a British electronic music group consisting of Alex Paterson, Guy Pratt and Dom Beken. Jimmy Cauty, co-founder of The Orb with Paterson, was involved in initial recording sessions but does not take part in live sessions. He is currently on "extended leave". The Transit Kings' music is reminiscent of The Orb and The KLF. The band was named Custerd for a brief period.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/OrbTransit.jpg/220px-OrbTransit.jpg
