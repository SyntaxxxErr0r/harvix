125.7	Ted_Bundy	Ted Bundy	Theodore Robert "Ted" Bundy (born Theodore Robert Cowell; November 24, 1946 â€“ January 24, 1989) was an American serial killer, rapist, kidnapper, and necrophile who assaulted and murdered numerous young women during the 1970s, and possibly earlier. After more than a decade of denials, he confessed shortly before his execution to 30 homicides committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978; the true total remains unknown, and could be much higher.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Ted_Bundy_headshot.jpg/220px-Ted_Bundy_headshot.jpg
