4.00	U1_spliceosomal_RNA	U1 spliceosomal RNA	U1 spliceosomal RNA is the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of U1 snRNP , an RNA-protein complex that combines with other snRNPs, unmodified pre-mRNA, and various other proteins to assemble a spliceosome, a large RNA-protein molecular complex upon which splicing of pre-mRNA occurs. Splicing, or the removal of introns, is a major aspect of post-transcriptional modification, and takes place only in the nucleus of eukaryotes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/RF00003.jpg/220px-RF00003.jpg
