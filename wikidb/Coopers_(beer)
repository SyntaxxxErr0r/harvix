1.10	Coopers_(beer)	Coopers Brewery	Coopers Brewery Limited, the largest Australian-owned brewery, is based in the Adelaide suburb of Regency Park, South Australia. Coopers is known for making a variety of high quality beers, the most famous of which are its Pale Ale and Sparkling Ale. It is also the world's largest producer of homebrewing equipment. Its shares are primarily owned by the extended Cooper family, and the company's constitution and classes of shares makes it difficult to sell shares outside the family.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/Coopers_Brewery_logo.svg/250px-Coopers_Brewery_logo.svg.png
