It came into being with the unification of the Kingdom of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. The new British Army incorporated Regiments that had already existed in England and Scotland and was administered by the War Office from London. It has been managed by the Ministry of Defence since 1964.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/BritishArmyFlag2.svg/250px-BritishArmyFlag2.svg.png
