66.1	Homophobia	Homophobia	Homophobia is a range of negative attitudes and feelings towards homosexuality and people who are identified as or perceived as being homosexual. Definitions refer variably to antipathy, contempt, prejudice, aversion, and irrational fear. Homophobia is observable in critical and hostile behavior such as discrimination and violence on the basis of a non-heterosexual orientation. In a 1998 address, author, activist, and civil rights leader Coretta Scott King stated that "Homophobia is like racism and anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Save_Our_Children_Brochure_inside.jpg/220px-Save_Our_Children_Brochure_inside.jpg
