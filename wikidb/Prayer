132.8	Prayer	Prayer	Prayer is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport to a deity or object of worship through deliberate communication. Prayer can be a form of religious practice, may be either individual or communal and take place in public or in private. It may involve the use of words or song. When language is used, prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creed, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person. There are different forms of prayer such as petitionary prayer, prayers of supplication, thanksgiving, and worship/praise. Prayer may be directed towards a deity, spirit, deceased person, or lofty idea, for the purpose of worshipping, requesting guidance, requesting assistance, confessing sins or to express one's thoughts and emotions. Thus, people pray for many reasons such as personal benefit or for the sake of others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Maria_Magdalene_praying.jpg/220px-Maria_Magdalene_praying.jpg
