73.8	European_Economic_Area	European Economic Area	The European Economic Area was established on 1 January 1994 following an agreement between the member states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Community, later the European Union (EU). Specifically, it allows Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to participate in the EU's Internal Market without a conventional EU membership. In exchange, they are obliged to adopt all EU legislation related to the single market, except laws on agriculture and fisheries. One EFTA member, Switzerland, has not joined the EEA.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/European_Economic_Area.svg/200px-European_Economic_Area.svg.png
