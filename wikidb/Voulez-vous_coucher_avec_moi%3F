12.61	Voulez-vous_coucher_avec_moi%3F	Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?	(English: "Do you want to sleep with me (tonight)?") is a French phrase that has become well known in the English-speaking world through popular songs. It is perhaps best known from the song "Lady Marmalade," first popularized in 1975 by the group Labelle. David Frizzell and Shelly West recorded a country music song in the 1980s called "Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi" that was unrelated to "Lady Marmalade". Later in 2001, singers Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, MÃ½a, and Pink did a remake of Lady Marmalade for the Moulin Rouge! film's soundtrack.
