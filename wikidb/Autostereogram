89.1	Autostereogram	Autostereogram	An autostereogram is a single-image stereogram (SIS), designed to create the visual illusion of a three-dimensional (3D) scene from a two-dimensional image in the human brain. In order to perceive 3D shapes in these autostereograms, the brain must overcome the normally automatic coordination between focusing and vergence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Stereogram_Tut_Random_Dot_Shark.png/300px-Stereogram_Tut_Random_Dot_Shark.png
