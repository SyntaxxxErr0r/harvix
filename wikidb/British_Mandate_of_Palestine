80.7	British_Mandate_of_Palestine	Mandatory Palestine	Mandatory Palestine, officially Palestine, was a geopolitic polity under British administration, carved out of Ottoman Syria after World War I. British civil administration in Palestine operated from 1920 until 1948. This administration was formalized with the League of Nations' consent in 1923 under the British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument) which covered two administrative areas. The land west of the Jordan River, known as Palestine, was under direct British rule until 1948, while the land east of the Jordan was a semi-autonomous region known as Transjordan, under the rule of the Hashemite family from the Hijaz, and gained independence in 1946.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Palestine-Mandate-Ensign-1927-1948.svg/125px-Palestine-Mandate-Ensign-1927-1948.svg.png
