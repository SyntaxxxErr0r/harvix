3.00	Hydraulic_accumulators	Hydraulic accumulator	The first accumulators for Armstrong's hydraulic dock machinery were simple raised water towers. Water was pumped to a tank at the top of these towers by steam pumps. When dock machinery required hydraulic power, the hydrostatic head of the water's height above ground provided the necessary pressure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Grimsby_Dock_Tower_%28aerial_view%29.jpg/220px-Grimsby_Dock_Tower_%28aerial_view%29.jpg
