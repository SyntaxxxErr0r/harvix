97.2	Lake_Michigan	Lake Michigan	Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one located entirely within the United States. The other four Great Lakes are shared by the US and Canada. It is the second largest of the Great Lakes by volume and the third largest by surface area, after Lake Superior and Lake Huron (and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia). Hydrologically, the lake is a large bay of Lake Michiganâ€“Huron, having the same surface elevation as Lake Huron (among other shared properties). It is bounded, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. The word "Michigan" originally referred to the lake itself, and is believed to come from the Ojibwa word mishigami meaning "great water".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Lake_Michigan_Landsat_Satellite_Photo.jpg/240px-Lake_Michigan_Landsat_Satellite_Photo.jpg
