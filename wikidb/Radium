64.6	Radium	Radium	Radium ( -dee-É™m) is a chemical element with atomic number 88, represented by the symbol Ra. Radium is an almost pure-white alkaline earth metal, but it readily oxidizes on exposure to air, becoming black in color. All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive, with the most stable isotope being radium-226, which has a half-life of 1601 years and decays into radon gas. Because of such instability, radium is luminescent, glowing a faint blue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Radium226.jpg/250px-Radium226.jpg
