197.4	Synchronicity	Synchronicity	Synchronicity is the experience of two or more events that are apparently causally unrelated or unlikely to occur together by chance and that are observed to occur together in a meaningful manner. The concept of synchronicity was first described in this terminology by Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss psychologist, in the 1920s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Sch%C3%A9ma_synchronicit%C3%A9_in_English.png/450px-Sch%C3%A9ma_synchronicit%C3%A9_in_English.png
