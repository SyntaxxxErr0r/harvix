113.9	Gelatin	Gelatin	Gelatin (or gelatine) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), flavorless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff. Gelatine is now classed as a food in its own right and not now subject to the food additives legislation in Europe. Gelatin has its own E-number 441 . It is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Gelatine.png/220px-Gelatine.png
