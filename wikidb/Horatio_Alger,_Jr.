55.0	Horatio_Alger,_Jr.	Horatio Alger, Jr.	Horatio Alger, Jr. (January 13, 1832 â€“ July 18, 1899) was a prolific 19th-century American author, best known for his many formulaic juvenile novels about impoverished boys and their rise from humble backgrounds to lives of middle-class security and comfort through hard work, determination, courage, and honesty. He initially wrote and published for adults, but a friendship with boys' author William Taylor Adams led him to writing for the young. He published for years in Adams' Student and Schoolmate, a children's magazine of moral writings. His lifelong theme of 'rags to riches' had a profound impact on America in the Gilded Age.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Horatioalger3a36980u.jpg/220px-Horatioalger3a36980u.jpg
