Depending on the mass of the star, this lifetime ranges from only a few million years for the most massive to trillions of years for the least massive, which is considerably longer than the age of the universe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/The_life_of_Sun-like_stars.jpg/275px-The_life_of_Sun-like_stars.jpg
