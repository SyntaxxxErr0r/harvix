51.1	Fast_moving_consumer_goods	Fast-moving consumer goods	Fast-moving consumer goods – or consumer packaged goods (CPG) – are products that are sold quickly and at relatively low cost. Examples include non-durable goods such as soft drinks, toiletries, and grocery items. Though the absolute profit made on FMCG products is relatively small, they generally sell in large quantities, so the cumulative profit on such products can be substantial.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Soft_drink_shelf.JPG/220px-Soft_drink_shelf.JPG
