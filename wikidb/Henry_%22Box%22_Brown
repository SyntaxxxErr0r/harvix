1.00	Henry_%22Box%22_Brown	Henry Box Brown	Henry "Box" Brown (1815-1879) was a 19th century Virginia slave who escaped to freedom by arranging to have himself mailed to Philadelphia abolitionists in a wooden crate. For a short time he became a noted abolitionist speaker and later a showman, but later lost the support of the abolitionist community, notably Frederick Douglass, who wished Brown had kept quiet about his escape so that more slaves could have escaped using similar means.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Boxbrown.jpg/300px-Boxbrown.jpg
