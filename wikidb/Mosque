78.6	Mosque	Mosque	A mosque is a place of worship for followers of Islam. The word entered English from a French word which probably derived from Italian moschea, a variant of Italian moscheta, from either Armenian mzkiṭ or Greek μασγίδιον, from Arabic masjid, meaning "place of worship" or "prostration in prayer", from Arabic sajada, meaning "to bow down in prayer" or "worship", probably ultimately of Aramaic origin. The word "mosque" in English refers to all types of buildings dedicated for Islamic worship, although there is a distinction in Arabic between the smaller masjid dedicated for the daily five prayers and the larger masjid jāmi (مسجد جامع) where the daily five prayers and the Friday congregation sermons are held with a high volume of attendance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Nur-Astana_Mosque.jpg/220px-Nur-Astana_Mosque.jpg
