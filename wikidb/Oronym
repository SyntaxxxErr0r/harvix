6.00	Oronym	Oronym	An oronym (a type of homophone, also called a continunym or a slice-o-nym) is a pair of phrases which share a similar relationship as the homophonic, in that they differ in meaning and spelling, yet share a similar pronunciation. Continunyms share a similar chain of consonant and vowel sounds, however they are composed of words that are cut at different points in the phonetic strings, hence the name slice-o-nym. Examples include "an ice cream" and "a nice cream"; "mint spy" and "mince pie"; "ice cream" and "I scream"; "what an eyesore" and "what a nice whore"; "stuffy nose" and "stuff he knows".
