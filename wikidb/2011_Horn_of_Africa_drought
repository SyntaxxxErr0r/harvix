10.72	2011_Horn_of_Africa_drought	2011 East Africa drought	Since mid-July 2011, a severe drought has been affecting the entire East Africa region. Said to be "the worst in 60 years", the drought has caused a severe food crisis across Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya that threatens the livelihood of 9.5 million people. Many refugees from southern Somalia have fled to neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia, where crowded, unsanitary conditions together with severe malnutrition have led to a large number of deaths. Other countries in East Africa, including Sudan, South Sudan and parts of Uganda, are also affected by a food crisis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/FEWS_Eastern_Africa_July-September_projection.png/272px-FEWS_Eastern_Africa_July-September_projection.png
