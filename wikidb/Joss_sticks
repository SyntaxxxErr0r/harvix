4.00	Joss_sticks	Joss stick	Joss sticks are a type of incense used in many East Asian and Southeast Asian countries, traditionally burned before a Chinese religious image, idol or shrine. They can also be burned in front of a door, or open window as an offering to heaven, or devas. In modern days, joss sticks can be used for any purpose, such as to enhance the smell of a room, or to light fire crackers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/JossSticks001.jpg/220px-JossSticks001.jpg
