85.5	Dental_caries	Dental caries	Dental caries, also known as tooth decay or a cavity, is an infection usually bacterial in origin that causes demineralization of the hard tissues (enamel, dentin and cementum) and destruction of the organic matter of the tooth, usually by production of acid by hydrolysis of the food debris accumulated on the tooth surface . If demineralization exceeds saliva and other remineralization factors such as from calcium and fluoridated toothpastes, these tissues progressively break down, producing dental caries (cavities, holes in the teeth). The two bacteria most commonly responsible for dental cavities are Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus. If left untreated, the disease can lead to pain, tooth loss and infection. Today, caries remain one of the most common diseases throughout the world. Cariology is the study of dental caries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Toothdecay.png/150px-Toothdecay.png
