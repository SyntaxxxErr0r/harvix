18.63	Iron_Range	Iron Range	The Iron Range is a region that makes up the northeastern section of Minnesota in the United States. It is a region with multiple distinct bands of iron ore. The far eastern area, along the shore of Lake Superior, and the far northern area, along the Canadian border, of the region are not associated with iron ore mining. Due to its shape, the area is collectively referred to as the Arrowhead region of the state.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Map_of_Minnesota_highlighting_Iron_Range.png/220px-Map_of_Minnesota_highlighting_Iron_Range.png
