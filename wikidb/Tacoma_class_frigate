7.10	Tacoma_class_frigate	Tacoma class frigate	The Tacoma class of patrol frigates served in the US Navy during World War II. Named for Tacoma, Washington, the Tacoma class design was based on the British River class frigates, primarily distinguished by the pole foremast (instead of the British tripod) and lighter main guns (3" instead of the British 4"). Unlike most other types of warships, the Tacomas were built to mercantile standards, which resulted in weaker vessels but enabled them to be built quickly, and in Maritime Commission shipyards rather than the Navy's own yards. Many of these ships were commanded by U.S. Coast Guard officer teams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/USS_Peoria_%28PF-67%29.jpg/300px-USS_Peoria_%28PF-67%29.jpg
