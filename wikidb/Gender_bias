1.00	Gender_bias	Sexism	Sexism, also known as gender discrimination or sex discrimination, is defined as prejudice or discrimination based on sex; or conditions or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex. Sexism is a form of discrimination or devaluation based on a person's sex, with such attitudes being based on beliefs in traditional stereotypes of different roles of the sexes. Sexism is not just a matter of individual attitudes but is built into many societal institutions. The term sexism is most often used in relation to discrimination against women, in the context of patriarchy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Bettie_Page_driving.jpg/300px-Bettie_Page_driving.jpg
