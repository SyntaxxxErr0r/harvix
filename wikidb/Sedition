81.6	Sedition	Sedition	In law, sedition is overt conduct, such as speech and organization, that is deemed by the legal authority to tend toward insurrection against the established order. Sedition often includes subversion of a constitution and incitement of discontent (or resistance) to lawful authority. Sedition may include any commotion, though not aimed at direct and open violence against the laws. Seditious words in writing are seditious libel. A seditionist is one who engages in or promotes the interests of sedition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Jesus_wanted_poster.jpg/220px-Jesus_wanted_poster.jpg
