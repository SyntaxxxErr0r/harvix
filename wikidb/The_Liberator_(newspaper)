8.00	The_Liberator_(newspaper)	The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)	The Liberator (1831-1865) was an abolitionist newspaper founded by William Lloyd Garrison in 1831. Garrison published weekly issues of The Liberator from Boston continuously for 35 years, from January 1, 1831, to the final issue of January 1, 1866. Although its circulation was only about 3,000, and three-quarters of subscribers were African Americans in 1834, the newspaper earned nationwide notoriety for its uncompromising advocacy of "immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves" in the United States. Garrison set the tone for the paper in his famous open letter "To the Public" in the first issue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/1831_Liberator.jpg/220px-1831_Liberator.jpg
