1.00	Music_in_computer_games	Video game music	Video game music is any of the musical pieces or soundtracks and background musics found in video games. It can range from a simple synthesizer tune to an orchestral piece, usually such that the older the game, the simpler the music. In recent times, many games have had complex soundtracks similar to those of movies, and sometimes even interactive soundtracks which change in order to create an appropriate atmosphere, based on what the player does. It is also common for video game soundtracks to be commercially sold or performed in concerts that focus on video game music. Music can also be an important gameplay element in certain types of video games (like rhythm games).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Vg_icon.svg/150px-Vg_icon.svg.png
