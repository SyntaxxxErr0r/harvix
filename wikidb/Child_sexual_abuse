57.8	Child_sexual_abuse	Child sexual abuse	Long term negative effects on development leading to repeated or additional victimization in adulthood are also associated with child sexual abuse. Studies have established a causal relationship between childhood sexual abuse and certain specific areas of adult psychopathology, including suicidality, antisocial behavior, PTSD, anxiety and alcoholism. Adults with a history of abuse as a child, especially sexual abuse, are more likely than people with no history of abuse to become frequent users of emergency and medical care services. A study comparing middle-aged women who were abused as children with non-abused counterparts found significantly higher health care costs for the former.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/NIH_child_sex_abuse_disorders_graph.svg/400px-NIH_child_sex_abuse_disorders_graph.svg.png
