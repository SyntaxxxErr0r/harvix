196.3	Rapture	Rapture	The rapture is a reference to the "being caught up" referred to in 1 Thessalonians 4:17, when the "dead in Christ" and "we who are alive and remain" will be caught up in the clouds to meet "the Lord". The term "rapture" is used in at least two senses in modern traditions of Christian eschatology; in pre-tribulationist views, in which a group of people will be "left behind", and as a synonym for the final resurrection generally.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Teachings_of_Jesus_40_of_40._the_rapture._one_in_the_bed._Jan_Luyken_etching._Bowyer_Bible.gif/125px-Teachings_of_Jesus_40_of_40._the_rapture._one_in_the_bed._Jan_Luyken_etching._Bowyer_Bible.gif
