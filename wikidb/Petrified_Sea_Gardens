It preserves an area of ancient stromatolites in a Cambrian rock layer. Stromatolites "were first recognized, discovered, and interpreted in North America" here, on property owned by Robert F. Ritchie, a stonemason and amateur geologist, who detected them in 1922 and opened a park to show them to the public in 1924.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Grotto_at_Petrified_Sea_Gardens.jpg/250px-Grotto_at_Petrified_Sea_Gardens.jpg
