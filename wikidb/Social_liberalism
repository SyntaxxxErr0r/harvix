53.3	Social_liberalism	Social liberalism	Social liberalism is the belief that liberalism should include social justice. It differs from classical liberalism in that it believes the legitimate role of the state includes addressing economic and social issues such as unemployment, health care, and education while simultaneously expanding civil rights. Under social liberalism, the good of the community is viewed as harmonious with the freedom of the individual. Social liberal policies have been widely adopted in much of the capitalist world, particularly following World War II. Social liberal ideas and parties tend to be considered centrist or centre-left.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Yellow_flag_waving.svg/100px-Yellow_flag_waving.svg.png
