125.7	Troy	Troy	Troy was a city, both factual and legendary, located in northwest Anatolia in what is now Turkey, southeast of the Dardanelles and beside Mount Ida. It is best known for being the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle and especially in the Iliad, one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey seems to show that the name (Ilion) formerly began with a digamma: (Wilion). This was later supported by the Hittite form Wilusa.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Troas.png/350px-Troas.png
