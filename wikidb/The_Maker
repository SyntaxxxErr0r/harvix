2.10	The_Maker	Dreamtigers	Dreamtigers, first published in 1960 as El Hacedor ("The Maker"), is a collection of poems, short essays, and literary sketches by the Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges. Divided fairly evenly between prose and verse, the collection examines the limitations of creativity. Borges regarded Dreamtigers as his most personal work. In the view of Mortimer Adler, editor of the Great Books of the Western World series, the collection was a masterpiece of 20th century literature. Literary critic Harold Bloom includes it in his Western Canon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Dreamtigers.jpg/220px-Dreamtigers.jpg
