1.00	SS_Ragnhild_(1941)	SS Ragnhild (1941)	Ragnhild was a 2,866 GRT cargo ship which was built in 1941 for the British Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) as Empire Carey. In 1942 she was transferred to the Norwegian Government in exile and renamed Ragnhild. Her war service is very well documented, and serves to illustrate a typical tramp ship's service life during the Second World War.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fa/SS_Penelope.jpg/250px-SS_Penelope.jpg
