183.5	Groupthink	Groupthink	Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within groups of people. It is the mode of thinking that happens when the desire for harmony in a decision-making group overrides a realistic appraisal of alternatives. Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative ideas or viewpoints. Antecedent factors such as group cohesiveness, structural faults, and situational context play into the likelihood of whether or not groupthink will impact the decision-making process.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/WilliamHWhyteJrGroupthinkFortuneMarch1952Page114.png/220px-WilliamHWhyteJrGroupthinkFortuneMarch1952Page114.png
