132.1	Collective_unconscious	Collective unconscious	Collective unconscious is a term of analytical psychology, coined by Carl Jung. It is proposed to be a part of the unconscious mind, expressed in humanity and all life forms with nervous systems, and describes how the structure of the psyche autonomously organizes experience. Jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the personal unconscious, in that the personal unconscious is a personal reservoir of experience unique to each individual, while the collective unconscious collects and organizes those personal experiences in a similar way with each member of a particular species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Freud_Sofa.JPG/170px-Freud_Sofa.JPG
