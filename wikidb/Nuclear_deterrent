12.10	Nuclear_deterrent	Deterrence theory	Deterrence in foreign affairs, as Bernard Brodie (1959) wrote in his seminal work, is nothing new. In the simplest sense, deterrence means using the threat of military action to compel an adversary to do something, or to prevent them from doing something, that another state desires. Deterrence theory gained increased prominence as a military strategy during the Cold War with regard to the use of nuclear weapons. And, it took on a unique connotation during this time as an inferior nuclear force, by virtue of its extreme destructive power, could deter a more powerful adversary -- provided that this force could be protected against destruction by a surprise attack. A credible nuclear deterrent, Brodie wrote, must be always at the ready, yet never used.
