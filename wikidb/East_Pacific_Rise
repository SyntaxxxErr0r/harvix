18.13	East_Pacific_Rise	East Pacific Rise	The East Pacific Rise is a mid-oceanic ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary located along the floor of the Pacific Ocean. It separates the Pacific Plate to the west from (north to south) the North American Plate, the Rivera Plate, the Cocos Plate, the Nazca Plate, and the Antarctic Plate. It runs from an undefined point near Antarctica in the south northward to its termination at the northern end of the Gulf of California in the Salton Sea basin in southern California.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/East_Pacific_Rise.jpg/300px-East_Pacific_Rise.jpg
