6.10	Red_Roses_for_Me	Red Roses for Me	Red Roses for Me was the first full length album by the London-based band The Pogues and was released in 1984. It is filled with traditional Irish music performed with punk influences. Traditional songs and ballads mixed with Shane MacGowan's "gutter hymns" about drinking, fighting and sex was innovative at the time. Or as lead singer MacGowan explained the music: "I couldn't believe that nobody else were doing it, so we went on doing it ourselves..." The title "Red Roses for Me" is the name of a play by Sean O'Casey, though his works do not show any direct influence upon the band. O'Casey's song of the same name has been recorded by The Dubliners. The album reached number 89 in the UK album charts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/Red_roses_for_me.jpg/220px-Red_roses_for_me.jpg
