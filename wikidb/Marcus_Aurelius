216.6	Marcus_Aurelius	Marcus Aurelius	Marcus Aurelius (Latin: ;notes 1 26 April 121 â€“ 17 March 180 AD), was Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 AD. He ruled with Lucius Verus as co-emperor from 161 until Verus' death in 169. He was the last of the "Five Good Emperors", and is also considered one of the most important Stoic philosophers. During his reign, the Empire defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire; Aurelius' general Avidius Cassius sacked the capital Ctesiphon in 164. Aurelius fought the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatians with success during the Marcomannic Wars, but the threat of the Germanic tribes began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. A revolt in the East led by Avidius Cassius failed to gain momentum and was suppressed immediately.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Marcus_Aurelius_Glyptothek_Munich.jpg/220px-Marcus_Aurelius_Glyptothek_Munich.jpg
