114.1	Graph_(mathematics)	Graph (mathematics)	In mathematics, a graph is an abstract representation of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions called vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges. Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. Graphs are one of the objects of study in discrete mathematics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/6n-graf.svg/250px-6n-graf.svg.png
