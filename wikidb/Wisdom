107.5	Wisdom	Wisdom	Wisdom is a deep understanding and realization of people, things, events or situations, resulting in the ability to apply perceptions, judgements and actions in keeping with this understanding. It often requires control of one's emotional reactions (the "passions") so that universal principles, reason and knowledge prevail to determine one's actions. Wisdom is also the comprehension of what is true or right coupled with optimum judgment as to action. Synonyms include: sagacity, discernment, or insight.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Moses_San_Pietro_in_Vincoli.jpg/220px-Moses_San_Pietro_in_Vincoli.jpg
