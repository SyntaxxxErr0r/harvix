Similarly, the expression "turning it up to eleven" refers to the act of taking something to an extreme. In 2002 the phrase entered the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary with the definition "up to maximum volume."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/Spinal_Tap_-_Up_to_Eleven.jpg/220px-Spinal_Tap_-_Up_to_Eleven.jpg
