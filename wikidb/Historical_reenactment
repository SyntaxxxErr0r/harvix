51.24	Historical_reenactment	Historical reenactment	Historical reenactment is an educational activity in which participants attempt to recreate some aspects of a historical event or period. This may be as narrow as a specific moment from a battle, such as the reenactment of Pickett's Charge at the Great Reunion of 1913, or as broad as an entire period, such as Regency reenactment or The 1920s Berlin Project.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Assedio_al_Castello.jpg/220px-Assedio_al_Castello.jpg
