2.01	Saint_Thorlak	Saint Thorlak	Saint Thorlak Thorhallsson (Old Norse: ; Icelandic: ; 1133 – December 23, 1193), also spelled Thorlac, is the patron saint of Iceland. Born in Skálholt in southern Iceland, he was bishop of Skalholt from 1178 until his death. His status as a saint was declared in 1198 by the Althing, but this was never made official by the Catholic Church until January 14, 1984, when John Paul II canonized him officially and declared him the patron saint of Iceland. His life and dozens of his miracles are described in great detail in the Icelandic saga Þorláks saga Helga (Saga of Saint Thorlak), republished in Icelandic on the occasion of John Paul II's visit to Iceland in 1989. It seems likely that Thorlac's original sanctification, promoted by Latin texts on which this was based, 'was arranged in Icelandic ecclesiastical circles, clerics of both dioceses being conspicuous in reports of early miracles'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Saint_Thorlakur.JPG/200px-Saint_Thorlakur.JPG
