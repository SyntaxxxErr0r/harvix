55.7	Inflection_point	Inflection point	In differential calculus, an inflection point, point of inflection, or inflection is a point on a curve at which the curvature or concavity changes sign. The curve changes from being concave upwards (positive curvature) to concave downwards (negative curvature), or vice versa. If one imagines driving a vehicle along a winding road, inflection is the point at which the steering-wheel is momentarily "straight" when being turned from left to right or vice versa.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/X_cubed_plot.svg/150px-X_cubed_plot.svg.png
