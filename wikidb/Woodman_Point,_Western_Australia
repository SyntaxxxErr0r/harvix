When Stirling returned in 1829 with the first settlers for the Swan River Colony, Woodman Point would have been one of the first mainland landmarks sighted by the new arrivals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Woodman_pt_pano_gnangarra.jpg/2957px-Woodman_pt_pano_gnangarra.jpg
