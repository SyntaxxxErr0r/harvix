1.00	Legion_XX	Legio XX Valeria Victrix	Legio vigesima Valeria Victrix was a Roman legion, probably raised by Augustus some time after 31 BC. It served in Hispania, Illyricum, and Germania before participating in the invasion of Britannia in 43 AD, where it remained and was active until at least the beginning of the 4th century. The emblem of the legion was a boar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Roman_Empire_125.png/300px-Roman_Empire_125.png
