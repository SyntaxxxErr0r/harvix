64.5	Wu_wei	Wu wei	Wu wei (Chinese: ; a variant and derivatives: traditional Chinese: ; simplified Chinese: ; pinyin: wú wéi; Japanese: ; Korean: ; Vietnamese: ) is an important concept of Taoism (Daoism), that involves knowing when to act and when not to act. Another perspective to this is that "Wu Wei" means natural action - as planets revolve around the sun, they "do" this revolving, but without "doing" it; or as trees grow, they "do", but without "doing". Thus knowing when (and how) to act is not knowledge in the sense that one would think "now" is the right time to do "this", but rather just doing it, doing the natural thing.
