65.6	Stupa	Stupa	A stupa (from Sanskrit: m., स्तूप, stūpa, Sinhalese: ස්ථූපය, Pāli: थुप "thūpa", literally meaning "heap") is a mound-like structure containing Buddhist relics, typically the remains of Buddha, used by Buddhists as a place of worship. After "stupa", "chorten" is the most commonly encountered English term. The term "reliquary" is sometimes used, after a Christian functional equivalent. Stupas are an ancient form of mandala.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Sanchi_stupa.jpg/250px-Sanchi_stupa.jpg
