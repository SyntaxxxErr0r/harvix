51.5	Glengarry_Glen_Ross	Glengarry Glen Ross	Glengarry Glen Ross is a 1984 play written by David Mamet. The play shows parts of two days in the lives of four desperate Chicago real estate agents who are prepared to engage in any number of unethical, illegal acts—from lies and flattery to bribery, threats, intimidation and burglary—to sell undesirable real estate to unwitting prospective buyers. The play draws partly on Mamet's experiences in a Chicago real estate office, where he worked briefly in the late 1960s. The title of the play comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters, Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Glengarryprogramme.jpg/200px-Glengarryprogramme.jpg
