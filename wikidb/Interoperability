131.6	Interoperability	Interoperability	Beyond the ability of two or more computer systems to exchange information, semantic interoperability is the ability to automatically interpret the information exchanged meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results as defined by the end users of both systems. To achieve semantic interoperability, both sides must refer to a common information exchange reference model. The content of the information exchange requests are unambiguously defined: what is sent is the same as what is understood.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Interoperable_software.png/250px-Interoperable_software.png
