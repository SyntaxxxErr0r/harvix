6.11	Orochimaru	Orochimaru	Orochimaru (大蛇丸), featured in the Japanese folktale Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari, is the arch-enemy of the ninja Jiraiya. He was once named Yashagorō (夜叉五郎) and was one of Jiraiya's followers, but he was overtaken by serpent magic. Having changed his name to "Orochimaru", he gained the ability to turn himself into a giant serpent. He attacked Jiraiya and Tsunade and defeated them with his venom (only for another follower to save the couple's lives afterwards). The kanji literally mean "giant snake" or "serpent".
