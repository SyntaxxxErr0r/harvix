52.4	Deadweight_loss	Deadweight loss	In economics, a deadweight loss (also known as excess burden or allocative inefficiency) is a loss of economic efficiency that can occur when equilibrium for a good or service is not Pareto optimal. In other words, either people who would have more marginal benefit than marginal cost are not buying the product, or people who have more marginal cost than marginal benefit are buying the product.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Deadweight-loss-price-ceiling.svg/300px-Deadweight-loss-price-ceiling.svg.png
