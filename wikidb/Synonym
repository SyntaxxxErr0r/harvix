63.1	Synonym	Synonym	Synonyms are different words with almost identical or similar meanings. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek syn () ("with") and onoma () ("name"). The words car and automobile are synonyms. Similarly, if we talk about a long time or an extended time, long and extended become synonyms. In the figurative sense, two words are often said to be synonymous if they have the same connotation:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Library_of_Ashurbanipal_synonym_list_tablet.jpg/220px-Library_of_Ashurbanipal_synonym_list_tablet.jpg
