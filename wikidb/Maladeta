1.00	Maladeta	Maladeta	Maladeta (3,312 m) is a mountain in the Pyrenees, close to the highest peak in the range, Aneto, Aragon, Spain. Its name comes from the Spanish montes malditos which means "Damned Mountains". According to some authorities the local name for the massif was Mala hita ("bad rocks" or "bad upper regions"). When French travellers came to the region they translated the name into the French "Maladette", on the basis that it was cognate with the Italian term Maladetta (feminine for "damned"). Subsequenty the mountain became known as Maladeta, a term which encompasses the entire massif.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maladeta.jpg/280px-Maladeta.jpg
