1.20	Aquae_Cutiliae	Aquae Cutiliae	Aquae Cutiliae is a mineral spring in Italy, near the modern Cittaducale, 9 miles east of Rieti. The lake near it was supposed by classical writers to be the central point of Italy, and was renowned for its floating islands, which, as in other cases, were formed from the partial petrification of plants by the mineral substances contained in the water. Considerable remains of baths may still be seen thereâ€”they were apparently resorted to by Roman Emperors Vespasian and Titus late in their lifetimes, for both died there.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Terme_Vespasiano.JPG/220px-Terme_Vespasiano.JPG
