6.10	Koho_(company)	Koho (company)	Koho is a brand of ice hockey equipment that originated from Finland. Currently, Koho equipment is manufactured by The Hockey Company (parent company of CCM). Koho is especially known for its goaltending equipment. The main endorsees, instrumental to marketing the brand in the late 90s and early 2000s included Patrick Roy, Felix Potvin, Jocelyn Thibault, Tommy Salo, Mathieu Garon, Jean-Sebastien Giguere, and Roberto Luongo. Although Koho had the support of high-profile endorsees such as Jaromir Jagr, the player equipment lines were comparatively unsuccessful.

They are the exclusive retailer of the brand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/07/KOHO_logo.svg/200px-KOHO_logo.svg.png
