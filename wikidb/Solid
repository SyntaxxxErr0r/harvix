77.5	Solid	Solid	Solid is one of the three classical states of matter (the others being gas and liquid). It is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to changes of shape or volume. Unlike a liquid, a solid object does not flow to take on the shape of its container, nor does it expand to fill the entire volume available to it like a gas does. The atoms in a solid are tightly bound to each other, either in a regular geometric lattice or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Insulincrystals.jpg/300px-Insulincrystals.jpg
