4.00	Shoo_Shoo_Baby_(aircraft)	Shoo Shoo Baby (aircraft)	Shoo Shoo Baby is the name of a B-17 Flying Fortress in World War II, preserved and on public display. A B-17G-35-BO, serial number 42-32076, and manufactured by Boeing, it was named by her crew for a song of the same name made popular by The Andrews Sisters, the favorite song of its crew chief T/Sgt. Hank Cordes. Photographs of the bomber indicate that a third "Shoo" was added to the name at some point in May 1944 when the original aircraft commander completed his tour of duty and was replaced by another pilot.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Boeing_B-17G_Superfortress_Shoo_Shoo_Baby_USAF.jpg/250px-Boeing_B-17G_Superfortress_Shoo_Shoo_Baby_USAF.jpg
