119.9	Patron_saint	Patron saint	A patron saint is a saint who is regarded as the intercessor and advocate in heaven of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family, or person. Patron saints, because they have already transcended to the metaphysical, are believed to be able to intercede effectively for the needs of their special charges.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Evangelist-St.-Matthew-And-The-Angel.jpg/200px-Evangelist-St.-Matthew-And-The-Angel.jpg
