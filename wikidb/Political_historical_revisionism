1.00	Political_historical_revisionism	Historical revisionism (negationism)	Historical revisionism is either the legitimate scholastic re-examination of existing knowledge about a historical event, or the illegitimate distortion of the historical record such that certain events appear in a more or less favourable light. For the former, i.e. the academic pursuit, see historical revisionism. This article deals solely with the latter, the distortion of history, which—if it constitutes the denial of historical crimes—is also sometimes (but not commonly) called negationism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Voroshilov%2C_Molotov%2C_Stalin%2C_with_Nikolai_Yezhov.jpg/120px-Voroshilov%2C_Molotov%2C_Stalin%2C_with_Nikolai_Yezhov.jpg
