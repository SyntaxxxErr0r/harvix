125.3	Greenwich_Village	Greenwich Village	Greenwich Village,pronunciation 1 in New York often simply called "the Village", is a largely residential neighborhood on the west side of Lower Manhattan in New York City. A large majority of the district is home to upper middle class families. Greenwich Village, however, was known in the late 19th to mid 20th centuries as an artists' haven, the bohemian capital, and the East Coast birthplace of the Beat movement. What provided the initial attractive character of the community eventually contributed to its gentrification and commercialization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Washington_square_park.jpg/250px-Washington_square_park.jpg
