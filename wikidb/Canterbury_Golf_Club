1.10	Canterbury_Golf_Club	Canterbury Golf Club	The Canterbury Golf Club, in Beachwood (and its northernmost tip in Shaker Heights), near Cleveland, Ohio was organized more than half century ago when a group of prominent Cleveland men interested in playing golf on a championship course gathered for that purpose at the University Club. Since that time, Canterbury has been developed over the years as a family club providing a wide range of facilities and activities for golfing members, as well as for members with other interests.
