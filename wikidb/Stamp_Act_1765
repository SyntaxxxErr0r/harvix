160.0	Stamp_Act_1765	Stamp Act 1765	The Stamp Act 1765 (short title Duties in American Colonies Act 1765; 5 George III, c. 12) was a direct tax imposed by the British Parliament specifically on the colonies of British America. The act required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. These printed materials were legal documents, magazines, newspapers and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies. Like previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money. The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the Seven Years' War. The British government felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of this military presence, and should pay at least a portion of the expense.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Coat_of_Arms_of_Great_Britain_%281714-1801%29.svg/140px-Coat_of_Arms_of_Great_Britain_%281714-1801%29.svg.png
