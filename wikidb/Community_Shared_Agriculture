3.30	Community_Shared_Agriculture	Community-supported agriculture	Community-supported agriculture (in Canada, community-shared agriculture) (CSA) is an alternative, locally-based socio-economic model of agriculture and food distribution. A CSA also refers to a particular network or association of individuals who have pledged to support one or more local farms, with growers and consumers sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA members or subscribers pay at the onset of the growing season for a share of the anticipated harvest; once harvesting begins, they receive weekly shares of vegetables and fruit, in a vegetable box scheme, and also sometimes herbs, cut flowers, honey, eggs, dairy products and meat, as well. Some CSAs provide for contributions of labor in lieu of a portion of subscription costs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Clagett_Farm_CSA_Week_11.jpg/250px-Clagett_Farm_CSA_Week_11.jpg
