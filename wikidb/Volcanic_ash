72.3	Volcanic_ash	Volcanic ash	Volcanic ash consists of small tephra, which are bits of pulverized rock and glass created by volcanic eruptions, less than 2 millimetres (0.1 in) in diameter. There are three mechanisms of volcanic ash formation: gas release under decompression causing magmatic eruptions; thermal contraction from chilling on contact with water causing phreatomagmatic eruptions, and ejection of entrained particles during steam eruptions causing phreatic eruptions. The violent nature of volcanic eruptions involving steam results in the magma and solid rock surrounding the vent being torn into particles of clay to sand size. Volcanic ash can lead to breathing problems and malfunctions in machinery, and clouds of it can threaten aircraft and alter weather patterns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Plume_from_eruption_of_Chaiten_volcano%2C_Chile.jpg/220px-Plume_from_eruption_of_Chaiten_volcano%2C_Chile.jpg
