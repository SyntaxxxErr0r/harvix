62.90	Carbon_sink	Carbon sink	Current agricultural practices lead to carbon loss from soils. It has been suggested that improved farming practices could return the soils to being a carbon sink. Present worldwide practises of overgrazing are substantially reducing many grasslands' performance as carbon sinks. The Rodale Institute says that Regenerative agriculture, if practiced on the planetâ€™s 3.5 billion tillable acres, could sequester up to 40% of current CO2 emissions. They claim that agricultural carbon sequestration has the potential to mitigate global warming. When using biologically based regenerative practices, this dramatic benefit can be accomplished with no decrease in yields or farmer profits. Organically managed soils can convert carbon dioxide from a greenhouse gas into a food-producing asset.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/CO2_pump_hg.svg/350px-CO2_pump_hg.svg.png
