55.1	Ussher_chronology	Ussher chronology	The Ussher chronology is a 17th-century chronology of the history of the world formulated from a literal reading of the Bible by James Ussher, the Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland). The chronology is sometimes associated with young Earth creationism, which holds that the universe was created only a few millennia ago by God as described in the first two chapters of the Biblical book of Genesis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Annales_Veteris_Testamenti_page_1.jpg/220px-Annales_Veteris_Testamenti_page_1.jpg
