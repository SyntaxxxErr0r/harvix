55.1	Cabrini-Green	Cabrini–Green	Cabrini–Green was a Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) public housing development on Chicago's Near North Side. It was bordered by Evergreen Avenue on the north, Orleans Street on the east, Chicago Avenue on the south, and Halsted Street on the west. Today, only a set of row houses, built in the 1940s, still remain (south of Oak Street, north of Chicago Avenue, west of Hudson Avenue, and east of Larrabee Street). At its peak, Cabrini–Green was home to 15,000 people, living in mid- and high-rise apartment buildings totaling 3607 units. Over the years, gang violence and neglect created terrible conditions for the residents, and the name "Cabrini–Green" became synonymous with the problems associated with public housing in the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Cabrini_Green_Housing_Project.jpg/280px-Cabrini_Green_Housing_Project.jpg
