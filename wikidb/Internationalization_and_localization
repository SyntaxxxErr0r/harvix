134.1	Internationalization_and_localization	Internationalization and localization	In computing, internationalization and localization are means of adapting computer software to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market. Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Italian_localisation.png/350px-Italian_localisation.png
