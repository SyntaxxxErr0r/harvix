54.0	Creosote	Creosote	Creosote is the portion of chemical products obtained by the distillation of a tar that remains heavier than water, notably useful for its anti-septic and preservative properties. It is produced in some quantities from the burning of wood and coal in blast furnaces and fireplaces; commonly found inside chimney flues when the wood or coal burns incompletely, producing soot and tarry smoke, and is the compound responsible for the preservation and the flavor of meat in the process of smoking. The name is derived from the Greek kréas (κρέας), meaning "flesh", and sōtēr (σωτήρ), meaning "preserver".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/Derivation_of_wood-tar_creosote.svg/360px-Derivation_of_wood-tar_creosote.svg.png
