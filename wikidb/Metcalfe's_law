171.7	Metcalfe's_law	Metcalfe's law	Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system . First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993, and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, circa 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of "compatible communicating devices" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.) Only more recently with the launch of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections. The law is also very much related to economics and business management, especially with competitive companies looking to merge with one another.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg/220px-Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg.png
