60.3	Precognition	Precognition	In parapsychology, precognition (from the Latin præ-, “before,” + cognitio, “acquiring knowledge”), also called future sight, and second sight, is a type of extrasensory perception that would involve the acquisition or effect of future information that cannot be deduced from presently available and normally acquired sense-based information or laws of physics and/or nature. A premonition (from the Latin praemonēre) and a presentiment are information about future events that is perceived as emotion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80_%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87_%E2%80%94_%D0%92%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%87%D1%83%D1%82%D1%82%D1%8F.jpg/240px-%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80_%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87_%E2%80%94_%D0%92%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%87%D1%83%D1%82%D1%82%D1%8F.jpg
