52.1	Recife	Recife	Recife is located where the Beberibe River meets the Capibaribe River to flow into the Atlantic Ocean. It is a major port on the Atlantic Ocean. Its name is an allusion to the coral reefs that are present by the city's shores. The many rivers, small islands and over 50 bridges found in Recife city center characterize its geography and gives it the moniker of the "Brazilian Venice."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Montagem_Recife_%282%29.jpg/250px-Montagem_Recife_%282%29.jpg
