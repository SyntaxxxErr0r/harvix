72.6	Philadelphia_Convention	Constitutional Convention (United States)	The Constitutional Convention (also known as the Philadelphia Convention, the Federal Convention, or the Grand Convention at Philadelphia) took place from May 14 to September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to address problems in governing the United States of America, which had been operating under the Articles of Confederation following independence from Great Britain. Although the Convention was intended to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset of many of its proponents, chief among them James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the convention. The result of the Convention was the United States Constitution, placing the Convention among the most significant events in the history of the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.png/400px-Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.png.jpeg
