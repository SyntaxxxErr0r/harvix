26.83	Female_condom	Female condom	A female condom (also known as a femidom) is a device that is used during sexual intercourse as a barrier contraceptive and to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIsâ€”such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV) and unintended pregnancy. Invented by Danish MD Lasse Hessel, it is worn internally by the receptive partner and physically blocks ejaculated semen from entering that person's body. Female condoms can be used by the receptive partner during anal sex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Pr%C3%A9servatif_f%C3%A9minin.jpg/250px-Pr%C3%A9servatif_f%C3%A9minin.jpg
