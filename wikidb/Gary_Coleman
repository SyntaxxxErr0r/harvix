He was described in the 1980s as "one of television's most promising stars". After a successful childhood acting career, Coleman struggled financially later in life. In 1989, he successfully sued his parents and business advisor over misappropriation of his assets, only to declare bankruptcy a decade later.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/GaryColeman_May_2005.jpg/180px-GaryColeman_May_2005.jpg
