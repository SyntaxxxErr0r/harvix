169.3	Dodo	Dodo	The dodo was a flightless bird endemic to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. It stood about a metre (3.3 feet) tall, weighing about 20 kilograms (44 lb). The dodo lost the power of flight because food was abundant and mammalian predators were absent on Mauritius. It was related to pigeons and doves, and its closest relative was the Rodrigues Solitaire, which is also extinct. The external features of the dodo are only known from paintings and written accounts from the 17th century, but since these vary considerably, and only a few sketches are known to have been drawn from life, mystery remains over its exact appearance. The same is true of its habitat and behaviour.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Dodo_1.JPG/250px-Dodo_1.JPG
