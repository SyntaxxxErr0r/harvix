15.22	Jane_Collective	Jane Collective	The Jane Collective, officially known as the Abortion Counseling Service of Womenâ€™s Liberation, was an underground abortion service which operated in Chicago, Illinois from 1969 to 1973. The collective was started by a group of women in an effort to address the increasing number of abortions being performed by untrained persons that often had no medical experience at all. Since illegal abortions were not only dangerous but very expensive, the founding members of the collective believed that they could provide women with safer and more affordable access to abortions. During the years which Jane operated, the collective performed more than 11,000 abortions in Chicago. The collective disbanded after Roe v. Wade made abortion legal throughout the United States in 1973.
