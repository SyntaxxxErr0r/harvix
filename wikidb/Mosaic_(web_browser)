190.2	Mosaic_(web_browser)	Mosaic (web browser)	Mosaic is the web browser credited with popularizing the World Wide Web. It was also a client for earlier protocols such as FTP, NNTP, and gopher. Its clean, easily understood user interface, reliability, Windows port and simple installation all contributed to making it the application that opened up the Web to the general public. Mosaic was also the first browser to display images inline with text instead of displaying images in a separate window. While often described as the first graphical web browser, Mosaic was preceded by the lesser-known Erwise and ViolaWWW.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/NCSA_Mosaic.PNG/200px-NCSA_Mosaic.PNG
