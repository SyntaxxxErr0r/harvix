80.0	Kettling	Kettling	Kettling (also known as containment or corralling) is a police tactic for controlling large crowds during demonstrations or protests. It involves the formation of large cordons of police officers who then move to contain a crowd within a limited area. Protesters are left only one choice of exit, determined by the police, or are completely prevented from leaving.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/G20_climate_camp_police_kettling_protesters.jpg/220px-G20_climate_camp_police_kettling_protesters.jpg
