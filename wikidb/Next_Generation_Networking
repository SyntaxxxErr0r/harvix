26.76	Next_Generation_Networking	Next-generation network	Next-generation network is a broad term used to describe key architectural evolutions in telecommunication core and access networks. The general idea behind the NGN is that one network transports all information and services (voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating these into packets, similar to those used on the Internet. NGNs are commonly built around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term all IP is also sometimes used to describe the transformation toward NGN.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Classroom_in_FTC.JPG/300px-Classroom_in_FTC.JPG
