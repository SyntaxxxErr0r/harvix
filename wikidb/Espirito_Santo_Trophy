3.00	Espirito_Santo_Trophy	Espirito Santo Trophy	The Espirito Santo Trophy is a biennial world amateur team golf championship for women organised by the International Golf Federation. The inaugural event was held in 1964 and recent tournaments have featured teams from around forty countries. It is a strokeplay event, in which the best two individual scores in each team count towards the final score. For the first three decades it was dominated by the United States, but recent results have reflected the increasing globalisation of women's golf, with six different winners in six events from 1996 to 2006, and several top two placings by teams from Asia, including a win by South Korea.
