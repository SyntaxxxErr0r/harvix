With his wife, Kathryn McCamant, he is credited with coining the English term cohousing and introducing the cohousing model for use in North America. (Cohousing is a type of intentional community composed of small private homes with full kitchens, supplemented by extensive common facilities. A cohousing community is planned, owned and managed by the residents, groups of people who want more interaction with their neighbours.) In recent years he has focused on cohousing for older persons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/CharlesDurrett_Aug2009sm.jpg/220px-CharlesDurrett_Aug2009sm.jpg
