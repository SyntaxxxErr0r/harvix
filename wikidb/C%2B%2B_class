3.00	C%2B%2B_class	C++ classes	The C++ programming language allows programmers to separate program-specific datatypes through the use of classes. Classes define types of data structures and the functions that operate on those data structures. Instances of these datatypes are known as objects and can contain member variables, constants, member functions, and overloaded operators defined by the programmer. Syntactically, classes are extensions of the C struct, which cannot contain functions or overloaded operators.
