3.00	Complemented_lattice	Complemented lattice	In the mathematical discipline of order theory, a complemented lattice is a bounded lattice in which every element a has a complement, i.e. an element b satisfying a ∨ b = 1 and a ∧ b = 0. A relatively complemented lattice is a lattice such that every interval is complemented. Complements need not be unique.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Fano_plane_Hasse_diagram.svg/220px-Fano_plane_Hasse_diagram.svg.png
