These rules were based on those drafted by England's Jack Broughton in 1743 and governed the conduct of prizefighting/bare-knuckle boxing for over 100 years. They were later superseded by the Marquess of Queensberry rules, the origins of the modern sport of boxing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/John_L_Sullivan.jpg
