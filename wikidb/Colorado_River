64.5	Colorado_River	Colorado River	The Colorado River is the principal river of the southwestern United States and northwest Mexico. The 1,450-mile (2,330 km) river flows from the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of California, draining 246,000 square miles (640,000 km2) in parts of seven U.S. and two Mexican states. Known for its dramatic canyons and whitewater rapids, the Colorado is a vital source of water for agricultural and urban areas as well as an important provider of hydroelectric power in the southwestern desert lands of North America.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/DeadHorseStatePark.jpg/256px-DeadHorseStatePark.jpg
