94.5	Motion_capture	Motion capture	Motion tracking or motion capture started as a photogrammetric analysis tool in biomechanics research in the 1970s and 1980s, and expanded into education, training, sports and recently computer animation for television, cinema, and video games as the technology matured. A performer wears markers near each joint to identify the motion by the positions or angles between the markers. Acoustic, inertial, LED, magnetic or reflective markers, or combinations of any of these, are tracked, optimally at least two times the frequency rate of the desired motion, to submillimeter positions. The resolution of the system is important in both the spatial resolution and temporal resolution as motion blur causes almost the same problems as low resolution. Additionally global shutter systems tend to perform better than sensors due to the artifacts caused by rolling shutters.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Kistler_plates.jpg/220px-Kistler_plates.jpg
