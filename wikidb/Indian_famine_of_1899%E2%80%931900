3.00	Indian_famine_of_1899%E2%80%931900	Indian famine of 1899–1900	The Indian famine of 1899–1900 began with the failure of the summer monsoons in 1899 over west and Central India and, during the next year, affected an area of 476,000 square miles (1,230,000 km2) and a population of 59.5 million. The famine was acute in the Central Provinces and Berar, the Bombay Presidency, the minor province of Ajmer-Merwara, and the Hissar District of the Punjab; it also caused great distress in the princely states of the Rajputana Agency, the Central India Agency, Hyderabad and the Kathiawar Agency. In addition, small areas of the Bengal Presidency, the Madras Presidency and the North-Western Provinces were acutely afflicted by the famine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/British_Indian_Empire_1909_Imperial_Gazetteer_of_India.jpg/250px-British_Indian_Empire_1909_Imperial_Gazetteer_of_India.jpg
