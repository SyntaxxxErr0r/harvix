57.4	Golden_Eagle	Golden Eagle	The Golden Eagle is one of the best known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. Once widespread across the Holarctic, it has disappeared from many of the more heavily populated areas. Despite being extirpated from some its former range or uncommon, the species is still fairly ubiquitous, being present in Eurasia, North America, and parts of Africa. The highest density of nesting Golden Eagles in the world lies in southern Alameda County, California. These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their heads and necks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/GoldenEagle-Nova.jpg/220px-GoldenEagle-Nova.jpg
