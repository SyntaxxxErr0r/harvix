69.9	Kosher_foods	Kosher foods	Kosher foods are those that conform to the regulations of the Jewish Halakhic law framework, kosher meaning fit or allowed to be eaten only by the Halakhic community. A list of some kosher foods are found in the book of Leviticus 11:1-47. There are also certain kosher rules found there. Reasons for food not being kosher include the presence of ingredients derived from nonkosher animals or from kosher animals that were not slaughtered in the ritually proper manner, a mixture of meat and milk, wine, or grape juice (or their derivatives) produced without supervision, the use of produce from Israel that has not been tithed, or the use of non-kosher cooking utensils and machinery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Israel_4_028_Jew_with_kosher_food.jpg/220px-Israel_4_028_Jew_with_kosher_food.jpg
