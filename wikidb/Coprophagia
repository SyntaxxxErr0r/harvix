70.4	Coprophagia	Coprophagia	Coprophagia or coprophagy is the consumption of feces, from the Greek κόπρος copros ("feces") and φαγεῖν phagein ("to eat"). Many animal species practice coprophagia as a matter of course; other species do not normally consume feces but may do so under unusual conditions. Coprophagy refers to many kinds of feces eating including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), other individuals (allocoprophagy), or its own (autocoprophagy), those once deposited or taken directly from the anus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Ch.megacephala_wiki.jpg/220px-Ch.megacephala_wiki.jpg
