3.00	Automatic_Train_Stop	Automatic train stop	This is one of the systems prescribed since 1951 by the federal government to allow passenger trains to exceed a speed limit of 79 mph (127 km/h). The term applies to an intermittent system that triggers an alerter in the cab of the locomotive that the engineer must respond to within a set period of time before the brakes are automatically applied. The system has no ability to enforce speeds or signal indications; it instead attracts the attention of the engineer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d8/Coaster_2103-ATS-inductor.jpg/220px-Coaster_2103-ATS-inductor.jpg
