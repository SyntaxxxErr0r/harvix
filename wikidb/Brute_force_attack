144.9	Brute_force_attack	Brute-force attack	In cryptography, a brute-force attack, or exhaustive key search, is a strategy that can, in theory, be used against any encrypted data. Such an attack might be utilized when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier. It involves systematically checking all possible keys until the correct key is found. In the worst case, this would involve traversing the entire search space.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Board300.jpg/260px-Board300.jpg
