125.0	Pulsar	Pulsar	A pulsar is a highly magnetized, rotating neutron star that emits a beam of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation can only be observed when the beam of emission is pointing towards the Earth, much the way a lighthouse can only be seen when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer, and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very dense, and have short, regular rotational periods. This produces a very precise interval, between pulses that range from roughly milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Cycle_of_pulsed_gamma_rays_from_the_Vela_pulsar.gif/220px-Cycle_of_pulsed_gamma_rays_from_the_Vela_pulsar.gif
