111.0	Circumcision	Circumcision	Male circumcision is the surgical removal of some or all of the foreskin (prepuce) from the penis. Early depictions of circumcision are found in cave paintings and Ancient Egyptian tombs, though some pictures are open to interpretation. Religious male circumcision is considered a commandment from God in Judaism. In Islam, though not mentioned in the Qur'an, male circumcision is widely practiced and often considered to be sunnah. It is also customary in some Christian churches in Africa.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Circumcision_central_Asia2.jpg/230px-Circumcision_central_Asia2.jpg
