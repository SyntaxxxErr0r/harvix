1.11	Christoper_Columbus	Christopher Columbus	Christopher Columbus (unknown; before 31 October 1451 â€“ 20 May 1506) was an explorer, colonizer, and navigator, born in the Republic of Genoa, in what is today northwestern Italy. Under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean that led to general European awareness of the American continents in the Western Hemisphere. Those voyages, and his efforts to establish permanent settlements in the island of Hispaniola, initiated the process of Spanish colonization, which foreshadowed the general European colonization of the "New World".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Christopher_Columbus.PNG/220px-Christopher_Columbus.PNG
