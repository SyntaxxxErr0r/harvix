2.00	Dynamite_(Supremes_and_Four_Tops_album)	Dynamite (The Supremes and the Four Tops album)	Dynamite is the third and last collaborative album between Motown labelmates The Supremes and The Four Tops, released on the Motown label in 1971. It was also as unsuccessful as the previous three peaking at the lower hundreds of the Billboard Top 200 and failing to yield any hit singles. A year later, the Four Tops parted from Motown to sign with ABC Records (today, the catalogs of both ABC and Motown are owned by Universal Music Group).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Supremes-4tops-dynamite-lp.jpg/220px-Supremes-4tops-dynamite-lp.jpg
