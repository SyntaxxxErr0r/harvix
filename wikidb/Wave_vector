13.12	Wave_vector	Wave vector	In physics, a wave vector (also spelled wavevector) is a vector which helps describe a wave. Like any vector, it has a magnitude and direction, both of which are important: Its magnitude is either the wavenumber or angular wavenumber of the wave (inversely proportional to the wavelength), and its direction is ordinarily the direction of wave propagation (but not always, see below).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Wave_new_sine.svg/220px-Wave_new_sine.svg.png
