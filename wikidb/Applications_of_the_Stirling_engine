1.20	Applications_of_the_Stirling_engine	Applications of the Stirling engine	Applications of the Stirling engine range from mechanical propulsion to heating and cooling to electrical generation systems. A Stirling engine is a heat engine operating by cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas, the "working fluid", at different temperature levels such that there is a net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. The Stirling cycle heat engine can also be driven in reverse, using a mechanical energy input to drive heat transfer in a reversed direction (i.e. a heat pump, or refrigerator).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Stirling_Engine.jpg/250px-Stirling_Engine.jpg
