56.9	Power_supply	Power supply	A power supply is a device that supplies electrical energy to one or more electric loads. The term is most commonly applied to devices that convert one form of electrical energy to another, though it may also refer to devices that convert another form of energy (e.g., mechanical, chemical, solar) to electrical energy. A regulated power supply is one that controls the output voltage or current to a specific value; the controlled value is held nearly constant despite variations in either load current or the voltage supplied by the power supply's energy source.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Regatron_-_Model_238_AMB_-_Rowan_Controller_Co_-_Electronic_Measurements_-_front_panel.jpg/220px-Regatron_-_Model_238_AMB_-_Rowan_Controller_Co_-_Electronic_Measurements_-_front_panel.jpg
