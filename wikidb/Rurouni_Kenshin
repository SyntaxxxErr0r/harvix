55.7	Rurouni_Kenshin	Rurouni Kenshin	Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story Rurōni Kenshin Meiji Kenkaku Rōmantan), also known as Rurouni Kenshin and Samurai X, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Watsuki. The fictional setting takes place during the early Meiji period in Japan. The story is about a fictional assassin named Himura Kenshin, from the Bakumatsu who becomes a wanderer to protect the people of Japan. Watsuki wrote this series upon his desire of making a shōnen manga different from the other ones that were published in that time, with Kenshin being a former assassin and the story taking a more serious tone as it continued. Although the tragic tone was highly expanded as the manga advanced, Watsuki became determined to give it a happy ending as it was aimed at teenagers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/Kenshinvolume28.jpg/230px-Kenshinvolume28.jpg
