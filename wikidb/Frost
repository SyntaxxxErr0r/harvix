69.3	Frost	Frost	Frost is the solid deposition of water vapor from saturated air. It is formed when solid surfaces are cooled to below the dew point of the adjacent air as well as below the freezing point of water. Frost crystals' size differ depending on time and water vapour available. Frost is also usually translucent in appearance. There are many types of frost, such as radiation and window frost. Frost causes economic damage when it destroys plants or hanging fruits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/D_Hoarfrost_3.jpg/220px-D_Hoarfrost_3.jpg
