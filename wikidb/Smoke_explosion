2.00	Smoke_explosion	Backdraft	A backdraft is an explosive event at a fire resulting from rapid re-introduction of oxygen to combustion in an oxygen-starved environment, for example, the breaking of a window or opening of a door to an enclosed space. Backdrafts present a serious threat to firefighters, even those with a high level of experience. There is some controversy surrounding the question of whether backdrafts should be considered a type of flashover (see below).
