69.0	Seventh-day_Adventist_Church	Seventh-day Adventist Church	The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a Protestant Christian denomination distinguished by its observance of Saturday, the original seventh day of the Judeo-Christian week, as the Sabbath, and by its emphasis on the imminent second coming (Advent) of Jesus Christ. The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the middle part of the 19th century and was formally established in 1863. Among its founders was Ellen G. White, whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by the church today.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Seventh-Day_Adventist_Church_logo.svg/225px-Seventh-Day_Adventist_Church_logo.svg.png
