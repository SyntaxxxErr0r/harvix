4.40	Terrorism_in_China	Terrorism in the People's Republic of China	A common definition of terrorism is the systematic use or threatened use of violence to intimidate a population or government and thereby effect political, religious, or ideological change. Terrorism in the People's Republic of China may be construed to encompass a variety of activities, including (though not limited to) violence committed in the name of separatist movements in Xinjiang and Tibet, political campaigns by the Communist Party of China, and in some cases, public acts of self-harm and incitements to the same. In contemporary China, violent acts of terrorism are comparatively rare. Many instances of terrorism by non-state actors involve the Uyghur ethnic group in Northwest China.
