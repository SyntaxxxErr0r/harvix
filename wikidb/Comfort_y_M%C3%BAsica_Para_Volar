3.00	Comfort_y_M%C3%BAsica_Para_Volar	Comfort y Música Para Volar	MTV Unplugged: Comfort y Música Para Volar is a part-live, part-studio album recorded by Argentine rock band Soda Stereo. The first seven tracks were recorded live at MTV Studios in Miami, Florida for the show MTV Unplugged. The remaining four tracks were Sueño Stereo outtakes recorded in studio. The album was released by BMG Argentina in 1996. It was also the first Latin band to depart from the use of only acoustic instruments, using for most of the televised set conventional "plugged" instruments. Proof of this paradox is the fading "Un" part of the word unplugged depicted in the album cover. This album is considered the fifteenth best album in the history of Latin Rock and the best live album.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/SodaStereo_Unplugged.jpg/220px-SodaStereo_Unplugged.jpg
