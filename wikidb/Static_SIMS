1.02	Static_SIMS	Static secondary-ion mass spectrometry	All the secondary ions generated in SIMS analysis originate from the topmost monolayers of the bombarded solid. This means that all different modes of SIMS analysis are basically surface analyses secondary ion emission—atomic as well as molecular—reflect the chemical composition of the surface-near region of the bombarded solid. However, the intention of different SIMS analyses may be quite different. This depends on the erosion rate of the surface which is controlled by the dose of the primary ions. It may be bulk analysis (Dynamic SIMS) or a true analysis of originally uppermost monolayer of a condensed phase (Static SIMS).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/60/STATIC.SIMS.RICHA.1.GIF/300px-STATIC.SIMS.RICHA.1.GIF
