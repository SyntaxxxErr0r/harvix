134.6	Civil_disobedience	Civil disobedience	Civil disobedience is the active, professed refusal to obey certain laws, demands, and commands of a government, or of an occupying international power. Civil disobedience is commonly, though not always, defined as being nonviolent resistance. It is one form of civil resistance. In one view (in India, known as ahimsa or satyagraha) it could be said that it is compassion in the form of respectful disagreement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Portrait_Gandhi.jpg/200px-Portrait_Gandhi.jpg
