87.3	DEFCON	DEFCON	A defense readiness condition is an alert posture used by the United States Armed Forces. The DEFCON system was developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and unified and specified combatant commands. It prescribes five graduated levels of readiness (or states of alert) for the U.S. military, and increase in severity from DEFCON 5 (least severe) to DEFCON 1 (most severe) to match varying military situations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Dc_four_1.svg/150px-Dc_four_1.svg.png
