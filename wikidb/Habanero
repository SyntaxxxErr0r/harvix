95.8	Habanero	Habanero chili	The habanero chili (Spanish: ; Capsicum chinense) is one of the more intensely piquant species of chili peppers of the Capsicum genus. When used in English, it is sometimes spelled habañero—the diacritical mark being added as a hyperforeignism. Unripe habaneros are green, and they color as they mature. Common colors are orange and red, but white, brown, and pink are also seen. Typically a ripe habanero is 2–6 centimetres (0.8–2.4 in) long. Habanero chili peppers are rated 100,000–350,000 on the Scoville scale.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Habanero_closeup_edit2.jpg/220px-Habanero_closeup_edit2.jpg
