72.9	Christmas_truce	Christmas truce	Christmas truce was a series of widespread unofficial ceasefires that took place along the Western Front around Christmas 1914, during the First World War. Through the week leading up to Christmas, parties of German and British soldiers began to exchange seasonal greetings and songs between their trenches; on occasion, the tension was reduced to the point that individuals would walk across to talk to their opposite numbers bearing gifts. On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, many soldiers from both sides – as well as, to a lesser degree, from French units – independently ventured into "no man's land", where they mingled, exchanging food and souvenirs. As well as joint burial ceremonies, several meetings ended in carol-singing. Troops from both sides were also friendly enough to play games of football with one another.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Khaki-chums-xmas-truce-1914-1999.redvers.jpg/325px-Khaki-chums-xmas-truce-1914-1999.redvers.jpg
