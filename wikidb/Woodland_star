1.00	Woodland_star	Lithophragma	Lithophragma is a genus of flowering plants containing about twelve species native to western North America. These plants are known generally as woodland stars. The petals of the flowers are usually bright white with deep, long lobes or teeth. Each petal may look like three to five petals, when at closer inspection the lobes fuse into a single petal at its base. Most species reproduce via bulblets instead of seeds. L. maximum is a federally listed endangered species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Lithophragma_sp.jpg/220px-Lithophragma_sp.jpg
