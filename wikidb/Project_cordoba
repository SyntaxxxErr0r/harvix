1.00	Project_cordoba	Park51	Park51 (originally named Cordoba House) is a planned 13-story Islamic community center in Lower Manhattan. The majority of the center will be open to the general public and its proponents have said the center will promote interfaith dialogue. Plans for the center include a Muslim prayer space which, due to its location two blocks from the World Trade Center site, has controversially been referred to as the "Ground Zero mosque", though numerous commentators argued that it was neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/Park51Rendition.jpg/250px-Park51Rendition.jpg
