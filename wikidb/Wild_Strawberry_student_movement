1.10	Wild_Strawberry_student_movement	Wild Strawberries Movement	The Wild Strawberries Movement (Traditional Chinese: 野草莓運動; Simplified Chinese: 野草莓运动; pinyin: Yě cǎoméi yùndòng) is a protest movement in Taiwan begun on November 6, 2008 after the visit of China's ARATS chairman Chen Yunlin to the island. Police actions on protests aimed at Chen suppressed the display of Taiwan's national flag and the playing of Taiwanese songs. This prompted a group of 400 students in Taipei, Taiwan to begin a sit-in in front of the Executive Yuan in protest of Taiwan's Parade and Assembly Law (集會遊行法).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Wild_Strawberry_Logo.jpg
