85.1	Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation	Zapatista Army of National Liberation	Since 1994, the group has been in a declared war "against the Mexican state," though this war has been primarily nonviolent and defensive against military, paramilitary, and corporate incursions into Chiapas. Their social base is mostly rural indigenous people but they have some supporters in urban areas as well as an international web of support. Their main spokesperson is Subcomandante Marcos (currently a.k.a. Delegate Zero in relation to "the Other Campaign"). Unlike other Zapatista spokespeople, Marcos is not an indigenous Mayan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_the_EZLN.svg/200px-Flag_of_the_EZLN.svg.png
