52.7	Utah_teapot	Utah teapot	The Utah teapot or Newell teapot is a 3D computer model which has become a standard reference object (and something of an in-joke) in the computer graphics community. It is a mathematical model of an ordinary teapot of fairly simple shape, which appears solid, cylindrical and partially convex. A teapot primitive is considered the equivalent of a "hello world" program, as a way to create the easiest 3D scene with a somewhat complex model acting as basic geometry reference for scene and light setup. Many libraries will even have functions dedicated to drawing teapots.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Utah_teapot_simple_2.png/220px-Utah_teapot_simple_2.png
