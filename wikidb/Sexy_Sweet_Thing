2.00	Sexy_Sweet_Thing	Sexy Sweet Thing	Sexy Sweet Thing is an album released by funk/R&amp;B group Cameo in 2000. This 13-track release was Cameo's first full album of new material since 1994's In the Face of Funk. Peaking at only #64 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, the album was anything but a comeback. To date, this has been the most recent and last album released by Cameo; the only releases since Sexy Sweet Thing have been re-releases and compilation albums.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/Cameo-sst.jpg
