7.10	Iran%E2%80%93Venezuela_relations	Iran–Venezuela relations	Iran–Venezuela relations (Spanish: Las relaciones de Irán y Venezuela; Persian: روابط ایران و ونزوئلا) have strengthened substantially in recent years. The current presidents of Venezuela and Iran, President Hugo Chavez and President Ahmadinejad, respectively, have both described themselves on the world stage as opposed to "US imperialism". Citing this commonality of opinion, they regard each other as allies, and they have embarked on a number of initiatives together. For example, on January 6, 2007, the two announced that they would use some money from a previously-announced $2bn joint fund to invest in other countries that were "attempting to liberate themselves from the imperialist yoke", in Chavez's words. The two presidents declared an "axis of unity" against "US imperialism".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Iran_Venezuela_Locator.svg/250px-Iran_Venezuela_Locator.svg.png
