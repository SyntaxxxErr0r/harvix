1.00	Behemoth_(Static-X_song)	Cannibal (album)	Cannibal is the fifth studio album by Static-X, released on April 3, 2007. This is the first album from the band to contain guitar solos; every song with the exception of "Goat" has one. This is an album of firsts for the band, being the first album without an "otsego" song included (much to the surprise of fans), and the first album to feature the same line-up as the album preceding it. Additionally, it's the first Static-X album since Machine to have three singles released from it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Static-X_-_Cannibal.jpg/220px-Static-X_-_Cannibal.jpg
