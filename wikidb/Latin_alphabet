It evolved from a western variety of the Greek alphabet called the Cumaean alphabet, which was adopted and modified by the Etruscans who ruled early Rome. The Etruscan alphabet was in turn adopted and further modified by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg/200px-Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg
