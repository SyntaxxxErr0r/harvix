1.00	Le_Grand_D%C3%A9rangement	Expulsion of the Acadians	The Expulsion of the Acadians (also known as the Great Upheaval, the Great Expulsion, The Deportation, the Acadian Expulsion, Le Grand Dérangement) was the forced removal by the British of the Acadian people from present day Canadian Maritime provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island (an area also known as Acadie). The Expulsion (1755–1763) occurred during the French and Indian War. The Expulsion started by the British deporting Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies and then, after 1758, the British sent them to France. Approximately 11,500 Acadians were deported.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/A_View_of_the_Plundering_and_Burning_of_the_City_of_Grymross%2C_by_Thomas_Davies%2C_1758.JPG/300px-A_View_of_the_Plundering_and_Burning_of_the_City_of_Grymross%2C_by_Thomas_Davies%2C_1758.JPG
