57.0	Read-only_memory	Read-only memory	Read-only memory is a class of storage medium used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM cannot be modified, or can be modified only slowly or with difficulty, so it is mainly used to distribute firmware (software that is very closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/ROM_.jpg/220px-ROM_.jpg
