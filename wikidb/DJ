93.2	DJ	Disc jockey	A disc jockey, also known as DJ, is a person who selects and plays recorded music for an audience. Originally, "disc" (sometimes spelled "disk", although this is now uncommon) referred to phonograph records, not the later Compact Discs. Today, the term includes all forms of music playback, no matter the medium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/DJ_SPANGDAHLEM_AIR_BASE.jpg/220px-DJ_SPANGDAHLEM_AIR_BASE.jpg
