20.63	Disease_theory_of_alcoholism	Disease theory of alcoholism	The modern disease theory of alcoholism states that problem drinking is sometimes caused by a disease of the brain, characterized by altered brain structure and function. The existence of alcoholism as a disease is accepted by some within the medical and scientific communities, although critics exist. The American Medical Association (AMA) had declared that alcoholism was an illness in 1956. In 1991, The AMA further endorsed the dual classification of alcoholism by the International Classification of Diseases under both psychiatric and medical sections.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/1904_Claim_of_Alcoholism_being_Disease.jpg/200px-1904_Claim_of_Alcoholism_being_Disease.jpg
