54.4	Simlish	Simlish	Signs in The Sims games usually do not contain text, but consist entirely of graphics. For example, a pet shop sign in Unleashed displays a paw, a stop sign in Hot Date displays a white hand, and in The Sims 2 the sign for a grocery store depicts a cornucopia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Sims_2_Simlish.jpg/250px-Sims_2_Simlish.jpg
