This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the Black Power Movement, which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity, economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from oppression by white Americans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/AfricanAmericans1.png/229px-AfricanAmericans1.png
