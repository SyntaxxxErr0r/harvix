6.01	Kodo-kai	Kodo-kai	The Kodo-kai is under close surveillance by the National Police Agency, as the NPA considers the organization to not be a traditional yakuza organization, but to be more like a mafia-type organization or terrorist organization. The Kodo-kai is notorious for its defiant attitude toward the official, and has dispensed with the yakuza's traditional policy of co-operating with the police.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Kodo-kai.png/170px-Kodo-kai.png
