1.01	Reference_Point_(horse)	Reference Point (horse)	Reference Point (1984â€“1991) was a British Thoroughbred race horse and sire. In a career which lasted from August 1986 to October 1987 he ran ten times and won seven races. As a three-year-old he overcame sinus problems before winning York's Dante Stakes, the Epsom Derby, Ascot's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes, the Great Voltigeur and St. Leger in 1987. Notably, he is the last Derby winner to date to enter the St. Leger, much less win it. His final race of the season resulted in failure in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp, Paris when an abscess was later found to have been responsible for his below-par performance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Racing_silks_of_Louis_Freedman.svg/240px-Racing_silks_of_Louis_Freedman.svg.png
