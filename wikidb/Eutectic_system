10.11	Eutectic_system	Eutectic system	A eutectic system is a mixture of chemical compounds or elements that has a single chemical composition that solidifies at a lower temperature than any other composition made up of the same ingredients. This composition is known as the eutectic composition and the temperature is known as the eutectic temperature. On a phase diagram the intersection of the eutectic temperature and the eutectic composition gives the eutectic point. Not all binary alloys have a eutectic point; for example, in the silver-gold system the melt temperature and freeze temperature (solidus) both increase monotonically as the mix changes from pure silver to pure gold.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Eutectic_system_phase_diagram.svg/350px-Eutectic_system_phase_diagram.svg.png
