119.8	Lisp_(programming_language)	Lisp (programming language)	Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized Polish prefix notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today; only Fortran is older (by one year). Like Fortran, Lisp has changed a great deal since its early days, and a number of dialects have existed over its history. Today, the most widely known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/LISP_machine.jpg/220px-LISP_machine.jpg
