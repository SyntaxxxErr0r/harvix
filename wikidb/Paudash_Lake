3.30	Paudash_Lake	Paudash Lake	Paudash Lake is a lake in south central Ontario southwest of Bancroft along Hwy. 28. The lake is located in the Municipality of Highlands East in Haliburton County just north of Silent Lake Provincial Park, and is 27 km (17 mi) south of the panhandle of Algonquin Provincial Park. It is about two and a quarter hours' drive northeast from Canada's largest city, Toronto, and approximately the same distance, but a slower drive, west-southwest from the nation's capital, Ottawa. The nearest communities to Paudash Lake are the village of Cardiff, close to the lake's Inlet Bay, and the hamlet of Paudash to the northeast of Lower Paudash Lake. Actually two lakes, 'Paudash' and 'Lower Paudash', the lakes are located on the Crowe River, near its head waters, which flows into the Trent River at Crowe Bay north of Campbellford. The nearest shopping center in the area is the year-around resort town of Bancroft, while the next closest is the year-around resort town of Haliburton.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Paudash_Lake_sunset.jpg/240px-Paudash_Lake_sunset.jpg
