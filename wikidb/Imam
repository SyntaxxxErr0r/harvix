92.5	Imam	Imam	An imam (Arabic: ‎, plural: A'immah; Persian: ‎) is an Islamic leadership position, often the worship leader of a mosque and the Muslim community. Similar to spiritual leaders, the imam is the one who leads Islamic worship services. More often, the community turns to the mosque imam if they have a religious question. In smaller communities, an imam could also be the community leader.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Prayer_in_Cairo_1865.jpg/280px-Prayer_in_Cairo_1865.jpg
