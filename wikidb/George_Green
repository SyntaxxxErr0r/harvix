23.72	George_Green	George Green	George Green (14 July 1793 â€“ 31 May 1841) was a British mathematical physicist who wrote An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism (Green, 1828). The essay introduced several important concepts, among them a theorem similar to the modern Green's theorem, the idea of potential functions as currently used in physics, and the concept of what are now called Green's functions. George Green was the first person to create a mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism and his theory formed the foundation for the work of other scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson, and others. His work ran parallel to that of the great mathematician Gauss .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Green%27s_windmill.jpg/220px-Green%27s_windmill.jpg
