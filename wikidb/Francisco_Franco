75.6	Francisco_Franco	Francisco Franco	Francisco Franco y Bahamonde, better known under the name of Franco, (Spanish: ; 4 December 1892 – 20 November 1975) was a Spanish general, dictator and the leader of the Nationalist military rebellion in the Spanish Civil War, and totalitarian head of state of Spain, from October 1936 (as a unified nation from 1939 onwards) until his death in November 1975. He came to power while recognizing the principles of the far-right Falange movement, although this was for propaganda reasons, as he belonged to no political party before becoming Head of State. As head of state, Franco used the titles Caudillo de España and Generalissimo, but also was called formally as His Excellency, The Head Of State.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Franco0001.PNG/220px-Franco0001.PNG
