It was originally named Lockeport after George Locke, who owned the land that the town was built upon at a time when Chinese people were not allowed to own land. Locke is located in the primarily agricultural region south of Sacramento, California, near State Route 160. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and further was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1990 due to its unique example of a historic Chinese American rural community.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Locke_p1080790.jpg/250px-Locke_p1080790.jpg
