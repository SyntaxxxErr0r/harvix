66.7	Haka	Haka	Haka (singular is the same as plural: haka) is a traditional ancestral war cry, dance or challenge from the MƒÅori people of New Zealand. It is a posture dance performed by a group, with vigorous movements and stamping of the feet with rhythmically shouted accompaniment. The New Zealand rugby team's practice of performing a haka before their matches has made the dance more widely known around the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/MaoriWardanceKahuroa.jpg/220px-MaoriWardanceKahuroa.jpg
