67.5	Muckraker	Muckraker	The term muckraker is closely associated with reform-oriented journalists who wrote largely for popular magazines, continued a tradition of investigative journalism reporting, and emerged in the United States after 1900 and continued to be influential until World War I, when through a combination of advertising boycotts, dirty tricks and patriotism, the movement, associated with the Progressive Era in the United States, came to an end.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/McCluresCoverJan1901.jpg/225px-McCluresCoverJan1901.jpg
