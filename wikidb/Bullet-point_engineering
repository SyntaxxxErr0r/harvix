1.00	Bullet-point_engineering	Bullet-point engineering	Bullet-point engineering is a software design anti-pattern where developers use the features of competing software packages as checklists of features to implement in their own product. These features are often implemented poorly and haphazardly, without any real design, merely so they can be added to a bulleted list of features in marketing material. Bullet point engineering often leads to feature creep and software bloat but may also simply result in a poorly designed imitative product.
