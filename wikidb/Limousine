56.9	Limousine	Limousine	A limousine (or limo) is a luxury sedan or saloon car, especially one with a lengthened wheelbase or driven by a chauffeur. The chassis of a limousine may have been extended by the manufacturer or by an independent coachbuilder. These are called "stretch" limousines and are traditionally black or white. Limousines are usually liveried vehicles, driven by professional chauffeurs. As the most expensive form of automobile ground transportation, limousines are culturally associated with extreme wealth or power and are commonly cited as examples of conspicuous consumption. Among the less wealthy, limousines are often hired during special events (most commonly weddings and funerals).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Limousine.lincoln.black.arp.750pix.jpg/220px-Limousine.lincoln.black.arp.750pix.jpg
