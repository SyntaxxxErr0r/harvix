70.9	Prejudice	Prejudice	Prejudice (or foredeeming) The word prejudice is most often used to refer to preconceived judgments toward people or a person because of race, social class, ethnicity, age, disability, obesity, religion, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics. It also means beliefs without knowledge of the facts and may include "any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence." One would think that because of our ‘modern’ society and the continuous process of globalisation the interaction between people from different backgrounds, ethnic groups and religions is constantly increasing, hence the phenomenon of prejudice and discrimination should be diminishing. However, that is not true. People identify themselves with different groups, which in turn gives them the satisfaction of being safe and belonging. It is very relevant and clear in real world examples, those of the past and those of the present. Few of the most famous examples- the holocaust during the Second World War and the Apartheid of South Africa in the 1948-1993 period. These are the most extreme cases. There are lesser forms of prejudice and discrimination within groups of same ethnicity. These can be found mainly in academic institutions or work offices where some people have higher status and skill than others, which is usually caused by a developed authoritarian personality (Adorno et al., 1950).
