7.31	Quantum_Bigfoot_(hard_drive)	Quantum Bigfoot (hard drive)	The Quantum Bigfoot brand was a series of hard disk drives produced by Quantum Corp. in the mid to late 1990s. The Bigfoot series was notable for deviating from the standard form factor for hard drives. While most desktop hard drives use a 3.5-inch physical format, Quantum Bigfoot drives used a larger 5.25-inch form factor more commonly seen in CD-ROM and other optical disc drives. This form factor allowed Quantum to increase the capacity of their hard drives without an increase in data density, thus lowering costs compared to a 3.5-inch drive with the same capacity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Quantum_Bigfoot_HDD.jpg/220px-Quantum_Bigfoot_HDD.jpg
