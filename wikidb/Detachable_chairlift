3.00	Detachable_chairlift	Detachable chairlift	A detachable chairlift or high-speed chairlift is a type of passenger aerial lift, which, like a fixed-grip chairlift, consists of numerous chairs attached to a constantly moving wire rope (called a haul rope) that is strung between two (or more) terminals over intermediate towers. They are now commonplace at all but the smallest of ski resorts. Some are installed at tourist attractions as well as for urban transportation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Co_Vail_chairclamp.jpg/220px-Co_Vail_chairclamp.jpg
