4.20	Taxation_in_Colombia	Taxation in Colombia	Taxation in Colombia is determined by the Congress of Colombia, the Department of Colombia Assemblies and the Municipalities of Colombia councils, which determine what kind of taxes can be levied and which rates can be applied. The country inherited a harsh and diffused taxation policy from the Spanish Empire characterized by a heavy reliance on customs duties, due to the relatively-low capacity for local production of goods. Both the national and local governments' budgets run significant deficits.
