88.8	School	School	A school is an institution designed for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly compulsory. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below), but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Lmspic.png/350px-Lmspic.png
