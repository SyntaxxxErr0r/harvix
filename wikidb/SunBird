1.20	SunBird	Sunbird	The sunbirds and spiderhunters are a family, Nectariniidae, of very small passerine birds. There are 132 species in 15 genera. The family is distributed throughout Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and just reaches northern Australia. Most sunbirds feed largely on nectar, but also take insects and spiders, especially when feeding young. Flower tubes that bar access to nectar because of their shape, are simply punctured at the base near the nectaries. Fruit is also part of the diet of some species. Their flight is fast and direct on their short wings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Crimson_Sunbird_%28Aethopyga_siparaja%29_male.jpg/220px-Crimson_Sunbird_%28Aethopyga_siparaja%29_male.jpg
