52.1	Hatfield-McCoy_feud	Hatfield–McCoy feud	The Hatfield–McCoy feud (1882–1888) involved two families of the West Virginia–Kentucky back country along the Tug Fork, off the Big Sandy River. The Hatfields of West Virginia were led by William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield while the McCoys of Kentucky under the leadership of Randolph "Ole Ran'l" McCoy. Those involved in the feud descended from Ephraim Hatfield (born c. 1765) and William McCoy (born c. 1750). The feud has entered the American folklore lexicon as a metaphor for any bitterly feuding rival parties. More than a century later, the story of the feud has become a modern allegory on the perils of family honor, justice and vengeance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Matewan_West_Virginia_floodwall.jpg/300px-Matewan_West_Virginia_floodwall.jpg
