62.8	International_Klein_Blue	International Klein Blue	International Klein Blue (or IKB as it is known in art circles) was developed by French artist Yves Klein as part of his search for colors which best represented the concepts he wished to convey as an artist. IKB was developed by Klein and chemists to have the same color brightness and intensity as dry pigments, which it achieves by suspending dry pigment in polyvinyl acetate, a synthetic resin marketed in France as Rhodopas M or M60A by the firm Rh√¥ne Poulenc.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Ultramarinepigment.jpg/220px-Ultramarinepigment.jpg
