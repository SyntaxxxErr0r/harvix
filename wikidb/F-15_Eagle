55.7	F-15_Eagle	McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle	The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) F-15 Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter designed by McDonnell Douglas to gain and maintain air superiority in aerial combat. It is considered among the most successful modern fighters with over 100 aerial combat victories with no losses in dogfights. Following reviews of proposals, the United States Air Force selected McDonnell Douglas' design in 1967 to meet the service's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter. The Eagle first flew in July 1972, and entered service in 1976. The F-15 is expected to be in service with the U.S. Air Force past 2025.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/F-15%2C_71st_Fighter_Squadron%2C_in_flight.JPG/300px-F-15%2C_71st_Fighter_Squadron%2C_in_flight.JPG
