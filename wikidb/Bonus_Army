60.3	Bonus_Army	Bonus Army	The Bonus Army was the popular name of an assemblage of some 43,000 marchers—17,000 World War I veterans, their families, and affiliated groups—who gathered in Washington, D.C., in the spring and summer of 1932 to demand immediate cash-payment redemption of their service certificates. Its organizers called it the Bonus Expeditionary Force to echo the name of World War I's American Expeditionary Force, while the media called it the Bonus March. It was led by Walter W. Waters, a former Army sergeant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Bonus_marchers_05510_2004_001_a.gif/300px-Bonus_marchers_05510_2004_001_a.gif
