59.3	Sahel	Sahel	The Sahel is the ecoclimatic and biogeographic zone of transition between the Sahara desert in the North and the Sudanian Savannas in the south. It stretches across the north of the African continent between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea. The Arabic word sāḥil literally means "shore, coast", describing the appearance of the vegetation of the Sahel as a coastline delimiting the sand of the Sahara.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Sahel_Map-Africa_rough.png/300px-Sahel_Map-Africa_rough.png
