110.1	Satan	Satan	Satan , "the opposer", is the title of various entities, both human and divine, who challenge the faith of humans in the Hebrew Bible. In Christianity the title became a personal name, and "Satan" changed from an accuser appointed by God to test men's faith to the chief of the rebellious fallen angels ("the devil" in Christianity, "Shaitan" in Arabic, the term used by Arab Christians and Muslims). In Islam, a shayṭān is any evil creature, whether human, animal or spirit. With the definite article, the Shayṭān is Iblis, the Devil.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/GustaveDoreParadiseLostSatanProfile.jpg/250px-GustaveDoreParadiseLostSatanProfile.jpg
