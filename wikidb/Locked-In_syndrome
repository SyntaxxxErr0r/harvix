35.23	Locked-In_syndrome	Locked-in syndrome	Locked-in syndrome is a condition in which a patient is aware and awake but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the eyes. Total locked-in syndrome is a version of locked-in syndrome where the eyes are paralyzed as well. The term for this disorder was coined by Fred Plum and Jerome Posner in 1966. Locked-in syndrome is also known as cerebromedullospinal disconnection, de-efferented state, pseudocoma, and ventral pontine syndrome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/CerebellumArteries.jpg/230px-CerebellumArteries.jpg
