3.11	Keystone_XL	Keystone Pipeline	The Keystone Pipeline System is a pipeline system to transport synthetic crude oil and diluted bitumen ("dilbit") from the Athabasca Oil Sands in northeastern Alberta, Canada to multiple destinations in the United States, which include refineries in Illinois, the Cushing oil distribution hub in Oklahoma, and proposed connections to refineries and export terminals along the Gulf Coast of Texas. It consists of the operational "Keystone Pipeline" (Phase 1) and "Keystone-Cushing Extension" (Phase 2), and two proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion segments. After the Keystone XL pipeline segments are completed, American crude oil would enter the XL pipelines at Baker, Montana and Cushing, Oklahoma.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Truck_Hauling_36-inch_Pipe_To_Build_Keystone_XL_Pipeline.jpg/500px-Truck_Hauling_36-inch_Pipe_To_Build_Keystone_XL_Pipeline.jpg
