1.00	Logographic_script	Logogram	A logogram, or logograph, is a grapheme which represents a word or a morpheme (the smallest meaningful unit of language). This stands in contrast to phonograms, which represent phonemes (speech sounds) or combinations of phonemes, and determinatives, which mark semantic categories.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Papyrus_Ani_curs_hiero.jpg/220px-Papyrus_Ani_curs_hiero.jpg
