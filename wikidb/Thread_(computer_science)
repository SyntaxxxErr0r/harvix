132.2	Thread_(computer_science)	Thread (computing)	In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system. The implementation of threads and processes differs from one operating system to another, but in most cases, a thread is contained inside a process. Multiple threads can exist within the same process and share resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. In particular, the threads of a process share the latter's instructions (its code) and its context (the values that its variables reference at any given moment). To give an analogy, multiple threads in a process are like multiple cooks reading off the same cook book and following its instructions, not necessarily from the same page.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Multithreaded_process.svg/220px-Multithreaded_process.svg.png
