1.00	Accusative_language	Nominative–accusative language	Nominative–accusative is a form of morphosyntactic alignment in which subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs are distinguished from objects of transitive verbs through word order, case marking, and/or verb agreement. Nominative–accusative alignment can be realized through morphology, by visible coding properties, and/or syntax, by behavioral properties during participation in specific constructions. This type of alignment has a broad global distribution and is one of the major alignment systems characterizing a critical portion of the world’s languages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Accusative_alignment.svg/220px-Accusative_alignment.svg.png
