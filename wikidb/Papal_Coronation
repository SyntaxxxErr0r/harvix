6.40	Papal_Coronation	Papal coronation	A papal coronation was the ceremony of the placing of the papal tiara on a newly elected pope. The first recorded papal coronation was that of Pope Celestine II in 1143. Soon after his coronation in 1963, Pope Paul VI abandoned the practice of wearing the tiara. His successors have chosen not to resume the coronation practice. As one becomes pope upon consent to a proper election, the papal inauguration ceremony, with or without coronation, serves only symbolic purposes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Coelestin_V.jpg/250px-Coelestin_V.jpg
