It usually arises in cases of divorce or in connection with advances made from the estate of a deceased, if so provided for in his Will. Hotchpot was abolished for all persons dying intestate ( that is without a Will)by section 1(2)of the Law Reform (Succession) Act 1995 in respect of all intestates dying on or after January 1, 1996.
