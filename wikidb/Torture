149.1	Torture	Torture	Torture is the act of inflicting severe pain (whether physical or psychological) as a means of punishment, revenge, forcing information or a confession, or simply as an act of cruelty. Throughout history, torture has taken on a wide variety of forms, and has often been used as a method of political re-education, interrogation, punishment, and coercion. In addition to state-sponsored torture, individuals or groups may be motivated to inflict torture on others for similar reasons to those of a state; however, the motive for torture can also be for the sadistic gratification of the torturer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Diverse_torture_instruments.jpg/250px-Diverse_torture_instruments.jpg
