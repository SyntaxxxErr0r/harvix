207.1	Stonewall_riots	Stonewall riots	The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the gay rights movement in the United States and around the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Stonewall_Inn_1969.jpg/220px-Stonewall_Inn_1969.jpg
