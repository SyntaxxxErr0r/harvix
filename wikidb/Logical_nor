2.10	Logical_nor	Logical NOR	In boolean logic, logical nor or joint denial is a truth-functional operator which produces a result that is the negation of logical or. That is, a sentence of the form is true precisely when neither p nor q is trueâ€”i.e. when both of p and q are false. In grammar, nor is a coordinating conjunction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Venn1000.svg/220px-Venn1000.svg.png
