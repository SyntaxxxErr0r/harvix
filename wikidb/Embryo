80.5	Embryo	Embryo	An embryo (irregularly from Greek: , plural , lit. "that which grows," from en- "in" + bryein, "to swell, be full"; the proper Latinate form would be embryum) is a multicellular diploid eukaryote in its earliest stage of development, from the time of first cell division until birth, hatching, or germination. In humans, it is called an embryo until about eight weeks after fertilization (i.e. ten weeks Last Menstrual Period or LMP), and from then it is instead called a fetus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Wrinkledfrog_embryos.jpg/250px-Wrinkledfrog_embryos.jpg
