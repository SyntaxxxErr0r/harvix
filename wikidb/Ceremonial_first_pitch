21.20	Ceremonial_first_pitch	Ceremonial first pitch	The ceremonial first ball is a longstanding ritual of American baseball in which a guest of honor throws a ball to mark the end of pregame festivities and the start of the game. Originally, the guest threw a ball from his/her place in the grandstand to the pitcher or catcher of the home team. At some point , this morphed into the guest standing in front of the pitcher's mound and throwing towards (but rarely reaching ) home plate, though sometimes he or she may stand on the mound (as a pitcher would). The recipient of the pitch is usually a player from the home team.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Wilson_opening_day_1916.jpg/250px-Wilson_opening_day_1916.jpg
