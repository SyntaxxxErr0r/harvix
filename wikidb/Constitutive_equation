3.00	Constitutive_equation	Constitutive equation	In physics, a constitutive equation is a relation between two physical quantities (especially kinetic quantities are related to kinematic quantities) that is specific to a material or substance, and approximates the response of that material to external forces. It is combined with other equations governing physical laws to solve physical problems, like the flow of a fluid in a pipe, or the response of a crystal to an electric field.
