97.8	Snow_White	Snow White	"Snow White" is a fairy tale known from many countries in Europe, the best known version being the German one collected by the Brothers Grimm in 1812 (German: , "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"). The German version features elements such as the magic mirror, the poisoned apple, the glass coffin, and the seven dwarves, who were first given individual names in the 1912 Broadway play Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and then given different names in Disney's 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Grimm story, which is commonly referred to as "Snow White", should not be confused with the story of "Snow White and Rose Red", another fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm (in German "Schneewei√üchen", rather than "Schneewittchen").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/SnowWhite.png/200px-SnowWhite.png
