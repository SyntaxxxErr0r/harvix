102.6	Jackalope	Jackalope	The jackalope is a mythical animal of North American folklore (a so-called "fearsome critter") described as a jackrabbit with antelope horns or deer antlers and sometimes a pheasant's tail (and often hind legs). The word "jackalope" is a portmanteau of "jackrabbit" and "antalope", an archaic spelling of "antelope". It is also known as Lepus temperamentalus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Rabbit_shopes_papilloma_virus_3.jpg/220px-Rabbit_shopes_papilloma_virus_3.jpg
