69.2	Hama_massacre	Hama massacre	The Hama massacre (Arabic: â€Ž) occurred in February 1982, when the Syrian army, under the orders of the country's president, Hafez al-Assad, conducted a scorched earth operation against the town of Hama in order to quell a revolt by the Sunni Muslim community against the regime of al-Assad. The Hama massacre, carried out by the Syrian Army under commanding General Rifaat al-Assad, President Assad's younger brother, effectively ended the campaign begun in 1976 by Sunni Islamic groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, against Assad's regime, whose leaders were disproportionately from president Assad's own Alawite sect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/After_Hama_Massacre.jpg/297px-After_Hama_Massacre.jpg
