52.8	Electrical_conductivity	Electrical resistivity and conductivity	Electrical resistivity (also known as resistivity, specific electrical resistance, or volume resistivity) is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows the movement of electric charge. The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm⋅metre (Ω⋅m). It is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Resistivity_geometry.png/220px-Resistivity_geometry.png
