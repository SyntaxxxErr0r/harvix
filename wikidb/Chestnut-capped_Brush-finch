Despite its name, it is not a true finch, but rather a member of the large Emberizidae family, which also includes buntings, American sparrows, juncos and towhees. Until recently, it was generally placed in the genus Buarremon, while it occasionally has been placed in Atlapetes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Buarremon_brunneinucha-NBII_Image_Gallery_-a00216.jpg/220px-Buarremon_brunneinucha-NBII_Image_Gallery_-a00216.jpg
