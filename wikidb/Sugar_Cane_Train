2.20	Sugar_Cane_Train	Lahaina, Kaanapali and Pacific Railroad	The Lahaina, Kaanapali and Pacific Railroad (LKPRR) is a steam-powered heritage railroad in Lāhainā, Hawaii. The LKPRR operates the Sugar Cane Train, a 6-mile, 40-minute trip in open-air coaches pulled by vintage steam locomotives. The tracks connect Lahaina with Puukolii, stopping briefly at Kaanapali. A narrator points outs sites of interest during the trip, which crosses a 325-foot curved wooden trestle whose elevation yields panoramic views of neighboring islands and the West Maui Mountains.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/LKPRRtrestle.jpg/200px-LKPRRtrestle.jpg
