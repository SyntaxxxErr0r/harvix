4.21	Microtubule_organizing_center	Microtubule organizing center	Before cell division begins, the interphase MTOC replicates to form two distinct MTOCs (now typically referred to as centrosomes). During cell division, these centrosomes move to opposite ends of the cell and nucleate microtubules to help form the mitotic/meiotic spindle. Refer to centrosome for more detailed information.
