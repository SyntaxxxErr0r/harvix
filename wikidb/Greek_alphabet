100.3	Greek_alphabet	Greek alphabet	The Greek alphabet is the script that has been used to write the Greek language since at least 730 BC (the 8th century BC). The alphabet in its classical and modern form consists of 24 letters ordered in sequence from alpha to omega. The Greek alphabet was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, from which it differs by being the first alphabet that provides a full representation of one written symbol per sound both for vowels as well as consonants. The Greek alphabet in turn is the ancestor of numerous other European and Middle Eastern scripts that follow the same structural principle, among them Cyrillic and Latin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Greekalphabet.svg/250px-Greekalphabet.svg.png
