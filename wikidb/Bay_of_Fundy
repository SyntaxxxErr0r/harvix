54.6	Bay_of_Fundy	Bay of Fundy	The Bay of Fundy (French: ) is a bay on the Atlantic coast of North America, on the northeast end of the Gulf of Maine between the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, with a small portion touching the U.S. state of Maine. Some sources believe the name "Fundy" is a corruption of the French word "Fendu", meaning "split", while others believe it comes from the Portuguese fondo, meaning "funnel". The bay was also named Baie Fran√ßaise (French Bay) by explorer/cartographer Samuel de Champlain during a 1604 expedition led by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts which resulted in a failed settlement attempt on St. Croix Island.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Wpdms_nasa_topo_bay_of_fundy_-_en.jpg
