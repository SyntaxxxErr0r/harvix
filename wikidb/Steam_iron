3.02	Steam_iron	Clothes iron	A clothes iron, also referred to as simply an iron, is a small appliance used in ironing to remove wrinkles from fabric. Ironing works by loosening the ties between the long chains of molecules that exist in polymer fiber materials. With the heat and the weight of the ironing plate, the fibers are stretched and the fabric maintains its new shape when cool. Some materials such as cotton require the use of water to loosen the intermolecular bonds. Many materials developed in the twentieth century are advertised as needing little or no ironing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Electric_steam_iron.jpg/220px-Electric_steam_iron.jpg
