177.2	Serendipity	Serendipity	Serendipity means a "happy accident" or "pleasant surprise"; specifically, the accident of finding something good or useful without looking for it. The word has been voted one of the ten English words hardest to translate in June 2004 by a British translation company. However, due to its sociological use, the word has been exported into many other languages. Julius H. Comroe once described serendipity as : to look for a needle in a haystack and get out of it with the farmer's daughter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Black_Crowned_Night_Heron_-_Pileated_Woodpecker.jpg/300px-Black_Crowned_Night_Heron_-_Pileated_Woodpecker.jpg
