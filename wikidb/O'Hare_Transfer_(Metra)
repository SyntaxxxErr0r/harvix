2.10	O'Hare_Transfer_(Metra)	O'Hare Transfer (Metra)	O'Hare Transfer is a commuter railroad station along Metra's North Central Service that serves Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The station is 18.6 miles (29.9 km) away from Union Station, the southern terminus of the line. The station is located at the dead end of Zemke Boulevard off of Manneheim Road within former Economy Parking Lot F; however, that address is not given by Metra or by the airport. No access to or from the station is available other than by O'Hare's Shuttle Bus, which takes passengers to the Airport Transit System in Parking Lot E. An effort is currently under way to extend the people mover into a parking garage designed to replace the former parking lot, thereby providing more direct access between the two systems. The station is a possible terminus of Metra's planned Suburban Transit Access Route.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/O%27Hare_Transfer_Metra_Station.jpg/300px-O%27Hare_Transfer_Metra_Station.jpg
