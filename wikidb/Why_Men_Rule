2.21	Why_Men_Rule	The Inevitability of Patriarchy	The Inevitability of Patriarchy is a book by Steven Goldberg published by William Morrow and Company in 1973. The theory proposed by Goldberg is that social institutions, that are characterised by male dominance, may be explained by biological differences between men and women , suggesting male dominance (patriarchy) could be inevitable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Inevitability.jpg/150px-Inevitability.jpg
