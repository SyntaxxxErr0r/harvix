54.1	Spore	Spore	In biology, a spore is a reproductive structure that is adapted for dispersal and surviving for extended periods of time in unfavorable conditions. Spores form part of the life cycles of many bacteria, plants, algae, fungi and some protozoa. According to scientist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson, "There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth - and we know they're very hardened to radiation."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Sporic_meiosis.svg/260px-Sporic_meiosis.svg.png
