26.44	GLR_parser	GLR parser	In computer science, a GLR parser ("Generalized Left-to-right Rightmost derivation parser") is an extension of an LR parser algorithm to handle nondeterministic and ambiguous grammars. First described in a 1984 paper by Masaru Tomita, it has also been referred to as a "parallel parser". Tomita presented five stages in his original work, though, in practice, it is the second stage that is recognized as the GLR parser.
