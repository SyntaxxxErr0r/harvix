55.4	National_Day	National Day	The National Day is a designated date on which celebrations mark the nationhood of a nation or non-sovereign country. This nationhood can be symbolized by the date of independence, of becoming republic or a significant date for a patron saint or a ruler (birthday, accession, removal, etc.). Often the day is not called "National Day" but serves and can be considered as one. The National Day will often be a national holiday.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Independ%C3%AAncia_ou_Morte.jpg/220px-Independ%C3%AAncia_ou_Morte.jpg
