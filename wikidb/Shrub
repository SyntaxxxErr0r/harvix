60.7	Shrub	Shrub	A shrub or bush is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 5–6 m (15–20 ft) tall. A large number of plants may become either shrubs or trees, depending on the growing conditions they experience. Small, low shrubs such as lavender, periwinkle and thyme are often termed subshrubs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Cytisus_scoparius2.jpg/250px-Cytisus_scoparius2.jpg
