70.4	Rainbow_trout	Rainbow trout	The rainbow trout is a species of salmonid native to tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America. The steelhead is a sea-run rainbow trout (anadromous) usually returning to freshwater to spawn after two to three years at sea; rainbow trout and steelhead trout are the same species. The fish are often called salmon trout. Several other fish in the salmonid family are called trout, some are anadromous like salmon, whereas others are resident in freshwater only.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Trout.jpg/220px-Trout.jpg
