139.8	Comet	Comet	A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when close enough to the Sun, displays a visible coma (a thin, fuzzy, temporary atmosphere) and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are both due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. Comets have been observed since ancient times and have traditionally been considered bad omens.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Comet-Hale-Bopp-29-03-1997_hires_adj.jpg/220px-Comet-Hale-Bopp-29-03-1997_hires_adj.jpg
