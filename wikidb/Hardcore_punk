85.1	Hardcore_punk	Hardcore punk	Hardcore punk (sometimes referred to simply as hardcore) is an underground music genre that originated in the late 1970s, following the mainstream success of punk rock. Hardcore is generally faster, thicker, and heavier than earlier punk rock. The origin of the term "hardcore punk" is uncertain. The Vancouver-based band D.O.A. may have helped to popularize the term with the title of their 1981 album, Hardcore '81.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/Blackflag84.jpg/220px-Blackflag84.jpg
