6.31	Security_analysis	Security analysis	Security analysis is the analysis of tradeable financial instruments called securities. These can be classified into debt securities, equities, or some hybrid of the two. More broadly, futures contracts and tradeable credit derivatives are sometimes included. Security analysis is typically divided into fundamental analysis, which relies upon the examination of fundamental business factors such as financial statements, and technical analysis, which focuses upon price trends and momentum. Quantitative analysis may use indicators from both areas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Reserve-Bank-of-India.jpg/135px-Reserve-Bank-of-India.jpg
