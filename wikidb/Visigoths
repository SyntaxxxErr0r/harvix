These tribes were among the Germans who spread through the late Roman Empire during the Migration Period. The Visigoths defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378, and under Alaric I eventually moved into Italy and famously sacked Rome in 410 AD.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/CoronaRecesvinto01.JPG/380px-CoronaRecesvinto01.JPG
