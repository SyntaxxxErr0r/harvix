1.00	Luggage_van	Baggage car	A baggage car (US terminology) or luggage van (UK terminology) is a type of railway vehicle often forming part of the composition of passenger trains and used to carry passengers' checked baggage, as well as parcels ("express"). Being typically coupled at the front of the train behind the locomotive, this type of car is sometimes described as "head-end equipment". Passengers are not normally allowed access to baggage cars while trains are in motion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/STCR57636-oct132003.jpg/350px-STCR57636-oct132003.jpg
