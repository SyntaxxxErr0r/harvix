8.22	IND_Second_System	Proposed New York City Subway expansion (1929â€“1940)	Before unification in 1940, the City of New York made plans for expanding the Subway system. The first one, conceived in 1929, was to be part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND). By 1939, with unification planned, all three systems were included. Very few of these far-reaching lines were built, though provisions were made for future expansion on lines that intersect the proposals. The core Manhattan lines of the expansion were the Second Avenue Line (with an extension into the Bronx) and the Worth Street Line (connecting to the Rockaways). The Rockaways were eventually served by the subway via a city takeover of the Long Island Rail Road's Rockaway Beach Branch, which was also in the 1939 plans; the Second Avenue Subway is under construction as of 2007. It is of note that the majority of lines were designated to be built as elevated lines; this was likely a cost-cutting measure. The majority of the expansion was to occur in Queens, with the original proposal suggesting 52 miles of track be built in Queens alone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/1929_IND_Second_System.jpg/200px-1929_IND_Second_System.jpg
