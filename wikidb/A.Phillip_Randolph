1.00	A.Phillip_Randolph	A. Philip Randolph	Asa Philip Randolph (April 15, 1889 â€“ May 16, 1979) was a leader in the African American civil-rights movement and the American labor movement. He organized and led the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first predominantly Negro labor union. In the early civil-rights movement, Randolph led the March on Washington Movement, which convinced Franklin D. Roosevelt to desegregate production-plants for military supplies during World War II. In 1963, Randolph was the head of the March on Washington, which was organized by Bayard Rustin, at which Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his I Have A Dream speech. Randolph inspired the Freedom budget, sometimes called the "Randolph Freedom budget", which aimed to deal with the economic problems facing the Negro community, particularly workers and unemployed Negroes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/A._Philip_Randolph_1963_NYWTS.jpg/220px-A._Philip_Randolph_1963_NYWTS.jpg
