51.0	Tampere	Tampere	Tampere is located between two lakes, N채sij채rvi and Pyh채j채rvi. Since the two lakes differ in level by 18 metres (59 ft), the rapids linking them, Tammerkoski, have been an important power source throughout history, most recently for generating electricity. Tampere is dubbed the "Manchester of Finland" for its industrial past as the former center of Finnish industry, and this has given rise to its Finnish nickname "Manse" and terms such as "Manserock".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Downtown_Tampere4.jpg/250px-Downtown_Tampere4.jpg
