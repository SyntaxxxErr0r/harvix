51.5	Arcturus	Arcturus	Arcturus (α Boo, α Boötis, Alpha Boötis) is the brightest star in the constellation Boötes. To the naked eye, orange-yellow Arcturus has a visual magnitude of −0.04, making it the brightest star north of the celestial equator, and the fourth brightest star in the night sky, after –1.46 magnitude Sirius, –0.86 magnitude Canopus and –0.27 magnitude Alpha Centauri. However, Alpha Centauri is a bright binary star, whose unresolved components to the naked eye are both fainter than Arcturus. This makes Arcturus the third brightest individual star, just ahead of Alpha Centauri A (α Cen A), whose visual magnitude is −0.01.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Bootes_constellation_map.png/250px-Bootes_constellation_map.png
