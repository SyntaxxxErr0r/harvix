62.1	Herbivore	Herbivore	Herbivores are organisms that are anatomically and physiologically adapted to eat plant-based foods. Herbivory is a form of consumption in which an organism principally eats autotrophs such as plants, algae and photosynthesizing bacteria. More generally, organisms that feed on autotrophs in general are known as primary consumers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/White-tailed_deer_%28Odocoileus_virginianus%29_grazing_-_20050809.jpg/250px-White-tailed_deer_%28Odocoileus_virginianus%29_grazing_-_20050809.jpg
