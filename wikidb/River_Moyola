1.00	River_Moyola	River Moyola	The River Moyola or Moyola River stretches for approximately 27 miles from the Sperrin Mountains to Lough Neagh. The Moyola starts a small river (3-5m) for the first few miles of its length and proceeds to expand to a medium sized river (5-20m) and then to a large river (20m+) for its last couple of miles before entering Lough Neagh.
