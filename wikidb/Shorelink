1.00	Shorelink	Shorelink	Shorelink (referred to as Transdev - Shorelink Buses on its website) is a commuter bus company serving suburbs on the upper North Shore of Sydney, Australia. On 3 September 2001, the company was acquired by French public transport giant Transdev from the John A Gilbert group, forming a partnership with Transfield Services Limited in 2009. The service then operated with TransdevTSL branding, however since the merge of Veolia Transport and Transdev, the partnership has been dissolved and the operator is now only identified externally as Transdev.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Shorelink_Buses_logo.png/200px-Shorelink_Buses_logo.png
