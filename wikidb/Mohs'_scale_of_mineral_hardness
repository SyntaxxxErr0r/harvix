2.11	Mohs'_scale_of_mineral_hardness	Mohs scale of mineral hardness	On the Mohs scale, graphite (a principal constituent of pencil "lead") has a hardness of 1.5; a fingernail, 2.2–2.5; a copper penny, 3.2–3.5; a pocketknife 5.1; a knife blade, 5.5; window glass plate, 5.5; and a steel file, 6.5. A streak plate (unglazed porcelain) has a hardness of 7.0. Using these ordinary materials of known hardness can be a simple way to approximate the position of a mineral on the scale.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Talc_block.jpg/100px-Talc_block.jpg
