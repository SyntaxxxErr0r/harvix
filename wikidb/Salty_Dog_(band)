1.00	Salty_Dog_(band)	Salty Dog (band)	Salty Dog was a hard-rock band formed in late 1986 in Los Angeles by Jimmi Bleacher, Scott Lane, Michael Hannon and Khurt Maier. The band released its first and only major-label record in 1990, titled "Every Dog Has Its Day," composed of all original songs except for a cover of Willie Dixon's Spoonful. Guitarist Pete Reveen is the son of the magician Peter Reveen. The band, like many other hard-rock/metal bands in the early 1990s, were lost in the shuffle when the grunge-rock movement hit in late 1991 and swept the nation in 1992.
