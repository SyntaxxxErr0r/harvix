89.1	Messiah	Messiah	Messiah is the anglicized version of a Hebrew term (Hebrew: , Modern Tiberian ; Greek: ; Aramaic: ‎משיחא, Məšīḥaʼ; Arabic language مسيح, Masih; all meaning "anointed one") generally transliterated as Mashiach, designating a king or High Priest, who were traditionally anointed with holy anointing oil as described in Exodus 30:22-25 (the term was not applied exclusively to Jewish kings; the Hebrew Bible refers to Cyrus the great, king of Persia, as a messiah). Following the death of Simon bar Kokhba, who ruled Judea from 132-135 until defeated by the Romans and who was considered by some to be the last messiah, the term came to refer to a Jewish king who would rule at the end of history. In later Jewish messianic tradition and eschatology, messiah refers to a leader anointed by God, and in some cases, a future King of Israel, physically descended from the Davidic line, who will rule the united tribes of Israel and herald the Messianic Age of global peace.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/The_Last_Judgement._Jean_Cousin..jpg/300px-The_Last_Judgement._Jean_Cousin..jpg
