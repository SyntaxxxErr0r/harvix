185.1	Single-lens_reflex_camera	Single-lens reflex camera	A single-lens reflex (SLR) camera is a camera that typically uses a mirror and prism system (hence "reflex", from the mirror's reflection) that permits the photographer to view through the lens and hence see exactly what will be captured, as opposed to viewfinder cameras where the image could be significantly different from what will be captured.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Contax-s.jpg/250px-Contax-s.jpg
