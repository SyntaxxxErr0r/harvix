1.00	Osumi_class	Ōsumi class tank landing ship	The Ōsumi class LST (), is a Japanese amphibious transport dock. While the JMSDF describes the Ōsumi class as tank landing ships, they lack the bow doors and beaching capability traditionally associated with LSTs. Functionally, their well deck makes the Ōsumi class more like a dock landing ship (LSD) or amphibious transport dock (LPD).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/JDS_Ohsumi_LST-4001.jpg/300px-JDS_Ohsumi_LST-4001.jpg
