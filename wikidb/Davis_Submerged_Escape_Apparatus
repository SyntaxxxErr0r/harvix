Ltd., inspired by the earlier Fleuss system. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for Royal Navy submarine crews, it was sometimes used for diving and as an industrial breathing set.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Davis_Submerged_Escape_Apparatus.jpg/220px-Davis_Submerged_Escape_Apparatus.jpg
