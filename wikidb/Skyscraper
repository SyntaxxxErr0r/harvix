103.9	Skyscraper	Skyscraper	A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building of many storeys, usually designed for office and commercial use. There is no official definition or height above which a building may be classified as a skyscraper. One common feature is having a steel framework from which curtain walls are suspended, rather than load-bearing walls of conventional construction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/2tours_bologne_082005.jpg/180px-2tours_bologne_082005.jpg
