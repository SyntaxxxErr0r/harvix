99.3	David_Koresh	David Koresh	David Koresh (August 17, 1959 â€“ April 19, 1993), born Vernon Wayne Howell, was the leader of a Branch Davidian religious sect, believing himself to be its final prophet. Howell legally changed his name to David Koresh on May 15, 1990. A 1993 raid by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the subsequent siege by the FBI ended with the burning of the Branch Davidian ranch outside of Waco, Texas, in McLennan County. Koresh, 54 other adults and 21 children were found dead after the fire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/David_Koresh.jpg/220px-David_Koresh.jpg
