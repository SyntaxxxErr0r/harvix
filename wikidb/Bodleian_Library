51.3	Bodleian_Library	Bodleian Library	The Bodleian Library ( or ), the main research library of the University of Oxford, is one of the oldest libraries in Europe, and in Britain is second in size only to the British Library. Known to Oxford scholars as "Bodley" or simply "the Bod", under the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 it is one of six legal deposit libraries for works published in the United Kingdom and under Irish Law it is entitled to request a copy of each book published in the Republic of Ireland. Though University members may borrow some books from dependent libraries (such as the Radcliffe Science Library), the Bodleian operates principally as a reference library and in general documents may not be removed from the reading rooms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Bodleian20040124CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg/230px-Bodleian20040124CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg
