64.1	Music_theory	Music theory	Music has many different fundamentals or elements. These include but are not limited to: pitch, beat or pulse, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, allocation of voices, timbre or color, expressive qualities (dynamics and articulation), and form or structure. In addition to these "fundamentals" there are other important concepts employed in music both in Western and non-Western cultures including "Scales and/or Modes" and "Consonance vs. Dissonance."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Middle_C.png/220px-Middle_C.png
