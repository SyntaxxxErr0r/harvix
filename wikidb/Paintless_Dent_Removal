4.10	Paintless_Dent_Removal	Paintless dent repair	Paintless dent repair (PDR), also known as "paintless dent removal", is a collection of techniques for removing minor dents and dings from the body of a motor vehicle. A wide range of damage can be repaired using PDR; however, usually if there is paint damage, PDR may be unsuitable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Bigdentbefore.jpg/120px-Bigdentbefore.jpg
