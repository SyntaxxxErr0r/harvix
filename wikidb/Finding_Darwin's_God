Miller wherein he argues that evolution does not contradict religious faith. Miller argues that evolution occurred, that the earth is not young, that science must work based on methodological naturalism, and that evolution cannot be construed as an effective argument for atheism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/Finding_Darwin%27s_God_cover.jpg/150px-Finding_Darwin%27s_God_cover.jpg
