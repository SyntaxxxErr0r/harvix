71.6	Logistic_function	Logistic function	A logistic function or logistic curve is a common sigmoid curve, given its name in 1844 or 1845 by Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst who studied it in relation to population growth. A Generalized logistic curve can model the "S-shaped" behaviour (abbreviated S-curve) of growth of some population P. The initial stage of growth is approximately exponential; then, as saturation begins, the growth slows, and at maturity, growth stops.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Logistic-curve.svg/320px-Logistic-curve.svg.png
