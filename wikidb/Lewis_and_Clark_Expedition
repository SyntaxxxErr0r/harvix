132.6	Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition	Lewis and Clark Expedition	The Lewis and Clark Expedition, or "Corps of Discovery Expedition" (1804–1806) was the first transcontinental expedition to the Pacific Coast by the United States. Commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson and led by two Virginia-born veterans of Indian wars in the Ohio Valley, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, the expedition had several goals. Their objects were both scientific and commercial – to study the area's plants, animal life, and geography, and to discover how the region could be exploited economically.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Carte_Lewis-Clark_Expedition-en.png/375px-Carte_Lewis-Clark_Expedition-en.png
