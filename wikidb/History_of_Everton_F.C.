1.20	History_of_Everton_F.C.	History of Everton F.C.	St. Domingo Methodist Church's new chapel was opened in 1871, taking its name from St. Domingo Road, formerly St. Domingo Lane, Everton which in turn took its name from St. Domingo House, a building built in 1758 by West Indies trader and sugar boiler George Campbell who would frequent the Colony of Santo Domingo and later became Mayor of Liverpool (1763). St. Domingo House was named after the Spanish Colony which in turn was named after Saint Dominic. Six years later, Rev. Ben Swift Chambers was appointed Minister. He created a cricket team for the youngsters in the parish but, as cricket was only played in summer, there was room for another sport during winter. Thus a football club called St. Domingo's F.C. was formed in 1878.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/St._Dominic%2C_1515.jpg/150px-St._Dominic%2C_1515.jpg
