4.00	States_Rights	States' rights	States' rights in U.S. politics refers to political powers reserved for the U.S. state governments rather than the federal government. Since the 1940s, it has often been considered a loaded term because of its use in opposition to federally mandated racial desegregation. In law, states' prerogatives are protected by the Tenth Amendment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Kevin_R_C_Gutzman_in_2008.jpg/200px-Kevin_R_C_Gutzman_in_2008.jpg
