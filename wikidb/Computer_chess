Computer chess acts as solo entertainment (allowing players to practice and to better themselves when no human opponents are available), as aids to chess analysis, for computer chess competitions, and as research to provide insights into human cognition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/RS_Chess_Computer.JPG/220px-RS_Chess_Computer.JPG
