The amateur adventure game scene emerged in the mid to late 1990s, when releases of new commercial adventure games became more rare and easy distribution of games and game engines was made possible by increased access to the Internet, thus encouraging players to make games of their own. This situation was similar to that faced by players of interactive fiction. Nowadays the amateur scene is mainly centered around the Adventure Game Studio (AGS) community and a few adventure-related websites.
