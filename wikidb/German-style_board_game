73.4	German-style_board_game	German-style board game	German-style board games, frequently referred to in gaming circles as Euro Games or Euro-style, are a broad class of tabletop games that generally have simple rules, short to medium playing times, indirect player interaction and abstract physical components. The games emphasize strategy, play down luck and conflict, lean towards economic rather than military themes, and usually keep all the players in the game until it ends. German-style games are sometimes contrasted with American-style games, which generally involve more luck, conflict, and drama.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Spielstein_.jpg/220px-Spielstein_.jpg
