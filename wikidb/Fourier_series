60.7	Fourier_series	Fourier series	In mathematics, a Fourier series decomposes periodic functions or periodic signals into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or complex exponentials). The study of Fourier series is a branch of Fourier analysis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Fourier_Series.svg/180px-Fourier_Series.svg.png
