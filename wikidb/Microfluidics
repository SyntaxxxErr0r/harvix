65.3	Microfluidics	Microfluidics	The behavior of fluids at the microscale can differ from 'macrofluidic' behavior in that factors such as surface tension, energy dissipation, and fluidic resistance start to dominate the system. Microfluidics studies how these behaviors change, and how they can be worked around, or exploited for new uses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Microfluidics.jpg/250px-Microfluidics.jpg
