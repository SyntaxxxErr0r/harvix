59.3	DNA_profiling	DNA profiling	DNA profiling (also called DNA testing, DNA typing, or genetic fingerprinting) is a technique employed by forensic scientists to assist in the identification of individuals by their respective DNA profiles. DNA profiles are encrypted sets of numbers that reflect a person's DNA makeup, which can also be used as the person's identifier. DNA profiling should not be confused with full genome sequencing. It is used in, for example, parental testing and criminal investigation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Punuk.Alaska.skulls.jpg/150px-Punuk.Alaska.skulls.jpg
