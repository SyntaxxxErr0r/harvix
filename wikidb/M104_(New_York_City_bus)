1.00	M104_(New_York_City_bus)	Broadway Line (Midtown Manhattan surface)	The Broadway Line or Broadway Branch Line is a surface transit line in Manhattan, New York City, United States, running mainly along 42nd Street and Broadway from Murray Hill to Harlem. Formerly a streetcar line operated by the Third Avenue Railway, it is now the M104 Broadway bus route operated by the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority, a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. However, that bus route no longer runs along the entire streetcar route.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/NYC_Transit_Orion_VII_Next_Generation_hybrid_3800.jpg/220px-NYC_Transit_Orion_VII_Next_Generation_hybrid_3800.jpg
