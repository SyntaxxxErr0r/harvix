62.3	Carl_jung	Carl Jung	Carl Gustav Jung (English pronunciation: , German: ; 26 July 1875 â€“ 6 June 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and the founder of analytical psychology. Jung is considered the first modern psychiatrist to view the human psyche as "by nature religious" and make it the focus of exploration. Jung is one of the best known researchers in the field of dream analysis and symbolization. While he was a fully involved and practicing clinician, much of his life's work was spent exploring tangential areas, including Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy, astrology, and sociology, as well as literature and the arts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Jung_1910-crop.jpg/220px-Jung_1910-crop.jpg
