The network presently links most major cities on the islands of Honshu and Kyushu, with construction of a link to the northern island of Hokkaido underway and plans to increase speeds on the Tōhoku Shinkansen up to 320 km/h (199 mph). Test runs have reached 443 km/h (275 mph) for conventional rail in 1996, and up to a world record 581 km/h (361 mph) for maglev trainsets in 2003.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/JR_East_Shinkansen_lineup_at_Niigata_Depot_200910.jpg/300px-JR_East_Shinkansen_lineup_at_Niigata_Depot_200910.jpg
