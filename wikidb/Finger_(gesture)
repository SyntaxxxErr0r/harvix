57.0	Finger_(gesture)	Finger (gesture)	In Western culture, the finger (as in giving someone the finger or the bird), also known as the middle finger or flipping someone off, is an obscene hand gesture, often meaning the phrases "up yours","fuck off" ("screw off") or "fuck you" ("screw you") . It is performed by showing the back of a closed fist that has only the middle finger extended upwards. In a more common and less obscene use, extending the finger is the universal symbol of contempt.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/The_gesture02.jpg/180px-The_gesture02.jpg
