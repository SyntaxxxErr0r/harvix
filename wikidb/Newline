108.7	Newline	Newline	In computing, a newline, also known as a line break or end-of-line marker, is a special character or sequence of characters signifying the end of a line of text. The name comes from the fact that the next character after the newline will appear on a new lineâ€”that is, on the next line below the text immediately preceding the newline. The actual codes representing a newline vary across operating systems, which can be a problem when exchanging text files between systems with different newline representations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Newline_hex_0A.png/400px-Newline_hex_0A.png
