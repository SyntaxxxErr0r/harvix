89.2	Dieting	Dieting	Dieting is the practice of eating food in a regulated fashion to achieve or maintain a controlled weight. In most cases dieting is used in combination with physical exercise to lose weight in those who are overweight or obese. Some athletes, however, follow a diet to gain weight (usually in the form of muscle). Diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Feet_on_scale.jpg/220px-Feet_on_scale.jpg
