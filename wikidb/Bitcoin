196.9	Bitcoin	Bitcoin	Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic cash system using peer-to-peer networking, digital signatures and cryptographic proof to enable irreversible payments between parties without relying on trust. Payments are made in bitcoins, a digital currency issued and transferred by the Bitcoin network. Nodes broadcast transactions to the network, which records them in a public history, called the block chain, after validating them with a proof-of-work system. The Bitcoin network is by far the fastest distributed computing network in the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Bitcoin_logo.svg/200px-Bitcoin_logo.svg.png
