1.00	Deserta's_Petrel	Desertas Petrel	The Desertas Petrel is a small seabird in the gadfly petrel genus which breeds on Bugio Island in the Desertas off Madeira. The gadfly petrels in the genus Pterodroma are seabirds of temperate and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance have caused the taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. Although the systematics on this species has not yet been definitively established, provisionally some authorities have split the Desertas Petrel, separating the Desertas breeding birds from those in the Cape Verde archipelago., while others consider it a subspecies of the Fea's Petrel.
