6.10	Ancestor_veneration	Veneration of the dead	Veneration of the dead is based on the belief that the deceased, often family members, have a continued existence and/or possess the ability to influence the fortune of the living. Some groups venerate their ancestors; some faith communities, in particular the Catholic Church, venerate saints as intercessors with God.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Xingtian_Temple_DSC02236.jpg/220px-Xingtian_Temple_DSC02236.jpg
