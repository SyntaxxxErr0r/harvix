6.22	Trochoid	Trochoid	Trochoid is the word created by Gilles de Roberval for the curve described by a fixed point as a circle rolls along a straight line. As a circle of radius a rolls without slipping along a line L, the center C moves parallel to L, and every other point P in the rotating plane rigidly attached to the circle traces the curve called the trochoid. Let CP = b. If P lies inside the circle , on its circumference (b = a), or outside (b &gt; a), the trochoid is described as being curtate, common, or prolate, respectively. Parametric equations of the trochoid, which assume L is the x-axis, are	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/CycloidAnim04.gif/290px-CycloidAnim04.gif
