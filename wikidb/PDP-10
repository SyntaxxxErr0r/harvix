72.3	PDP-10	PDP-10	The PDP-10 was a mainframe computer family manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) from the late 1960s on; the name stands for "Programmed Data Processor model 10". The first model was delivered in 1966. It was the machine that made time-sharing common; it looms large in hacker folklore because of its adoption in the 1970s by many university computing facilities and research labs, the most notable of which were MIT's AI Lab and Project MAC, Stanford's SAIL, Computer Center Corporation (CCC), and Carnegie Mellon University.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/Decsystem.svg/250px-Decsystem.svg.png
