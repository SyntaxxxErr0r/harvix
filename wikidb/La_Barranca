2.00	La_Barranca	La Barranca	La Barranca has been a successful ongoing outfit for over a decade. Based in Mexico City, they are led by guitarist and songwriter José Manuel Aguilera, who previously and concurrently worked with Sangre Azteka, Jaguares, Cecilia Toussaint, Steven Brown/Nine Rain , and more. He has an unusually economical style of playing that concentrates on great rhythms, superb tone, and very melodic solos. After the original lineup—Aguilera, Federico Fong (bass), Alfonso Andre (drums), all of whom were guest members of Jaguares with former Caifanes frontman Saúl Hernández--went its separate ways, a second version of the band included Santa Sabina guitar virtuoso Alex Otaola and the extremely flexible rhythm section of brothers Jose María ("Chema") and Alonso Arreola. The band's sound effortlessly moves from flat out rock to fusion-ish jamming and passes through a kind of Mexican folk influence along the way. Aguilera is a good singer with a talent for finding simple melodies amidst rather complex songs. On "El Fluir" the band decided to record live and to cut back on the keyboard and programmed additions to their music. Surprisingly, the result was not an over-the-top jamfest but rather a very tightly arranged set of songs that hinted at the overwhelming power they could possess in concert. The two guitar interplay between Aguilera and Otaola was highly impressive as they explored all forms of playing together and against one another (with Otaola pulling all sorts of radical sounds out of his guitar). "El Fluir" was their first US release since "Tempestad" in 1998. This edition was further sweetened by the inclusion of a previously unreleased bonus track and a video for the first single "Pare de Sufrir."
