2.00	World_Golf_Championship	World Golf Championships	The World Golf Championships are a group of four annual events for male professional golfers created by the International Federation of PGA Tours, with a fifth to be added in 2012. All four current WGC tournaments are official money events on the European Tour and the Japan Golf Tour, and officially sanctioned by the Asian Tour, Sunshine Tour, PGA Tour of Australasia, and PGA Tour. Three of the four are official money events on the PGA Tour; the HSBC Champions does not offer official prize money on that tour. However, the HSBC Champions winner receives an invitation to the following year's Hyundai Tournament of Champions, the PGA Tour's season opener that invites only winners of tournaments in the previous season, and is also credited with an official PGA Tour win if he is a tour member.
