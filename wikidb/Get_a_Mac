78.1	Get_a_Mac	Get a Mac	The Get a Mac campaign is a television advertising campaign created for Apple Inc. by TBWA\Media Arts Lab, the company's advertising agency, that ran from 2006 to 2009. Shown in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Japan, the advertisements in the campaign have become easily recognizable because each advertisement follows a standard simple template: against a minimalist all-white background, a man dressed in casual clothes introduces himself as a Mac ("Hello, I'm a Mac."), while a man in a more formal suit-and-tie combination introduces himself as a Windows personal computer ("And I'm a PC."). The two then act out a brief vignette, in which the capabilities and attributes of Mac and PC are compared, with PC—characterized as formal and somewhat polite, though stuffy and overly concerned with work—often being frustrated by the more laid-back Mac's abilities. The older ones shifted focus away from comparing features of the computer systems to a more general comparison. The later ones, however, mainly concerned Windows Vista and, at the end, Windows 7.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Getamac.png/250px-Getamac.png
