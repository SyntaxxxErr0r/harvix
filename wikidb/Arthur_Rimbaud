82.1	Arthur_Rimbaud	Arthur Rimbaud	Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud (English pronunciation: or , French pronunciation: ; 20 October 1854 – 10 November 1891) was a French poet. Born in Charleville, Ardennes, he produced his best known works while still in his late teens—Victor Hugo described him at the time as "an infant Shakespeare"—and he gave up creative writing altogether before the age of 20. As part of the decadent movement, Rimbaud influenced modern literature, music and art. He was known to have been a libertine and a restless soul, travelling extensively on three continents before his death from cancer just after his 37th birthday.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Carjat_Arthur_Rimbaud_1872_n2.jpg/200px-Carjat_Arthur_Rimbaud_1872_n2.jpg
