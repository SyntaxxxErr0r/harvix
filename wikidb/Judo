Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the object is to either throw or takedown one's opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue one's opponent with a grappling maneuver, or force an opponent to submit by joint locking or by executing a strangle hold or choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice (randori).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Jigoro_Kano_and_Kyuzo_Mifune.jpg/200px-Jigoro_Kano_and_Kyuzo_Mifune.jpg
