The book was a minor bestseller that created alarm in parents and galvanized them to campaign for censorship. At the same time, a U.S. Congressional inquiry was launched into the comic book industry. Subsequent to the publication of Seduction of the Innocent, the Comics Code Authority was voluntarily established by publishers to self-censor their titles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Seduction_of_the_Innocent.jpg/200px-Seduction_of_the_Innocent.jpg
