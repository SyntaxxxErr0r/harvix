144.2	Command_line_interface	Command-line interface	A command-line interface (CLI) is an interface or dialog between the user and a program, or between two programs, where a line of text (a command line) is passed between the two. Many graphical interfaces, such as the OS/2 Presentation Manager and the various Windows shell use command-lines to call helper programs to open documents and programs. The commands are stored in the graphical shell or in files like the registry or the OS/2 os2user.ini file.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Linux_command-line._Bash._GNOME_Terminal._screenshot.png/300px-Linux_command-line._Bash._GNOME_Terminal._screenshot.png
