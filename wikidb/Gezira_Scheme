2.20	Gezira_Scheme	Gezira Scheme	The Gezira Scheme (Arabic: â€Ž) is one of the largest irrigation projects in the world. It is centered on the Sudanese state of Al Jazirah, just southeast of the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers at the city of Khartoum. The economy of Sudan was historically based on agriculture prior to the beginning of oil exports in the late 1990s. The Gezira Scheme was begun by the British and distributes water from the Blue Nile through canals and ditches to tenant farms lying between the Blue and White Nile rivers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Sudan_Gezira_Plain_1997.jpg/220px-Sudan_Gezira_Plain_1997.jpg
