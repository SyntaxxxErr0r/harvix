63.4	Exponential_distribution	Exponential distribution	In probability theory and statistics, the exponential distribution (a.k.a. negative exponential distribution) is a family of continuous probability distributions. It describes the time between events in a Poisson process, i.e. a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Exponential_pdf.svg/325px-Exponential_pdf.svg.png
