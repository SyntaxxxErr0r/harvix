2.00	Red_Kites	Red Kite	The Red Kite is a medium-large bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as eagles, buzzards, and harriers. The species is currently endemic to the Western Palearctic region in Europe and northwest Africa, though formerly also occurred just outside in northern Iran. It is a rare species which is resident in the milder parts of its range in western Europe and northwest Africa, but birds from northeastern and central Europe winter further south and west, reaching south to Turkey. Vagrants have reached north to Finland and south to Israel and Libya.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Milvus_milvus_R%28ThKraft%29.jpg/240px-Milvus_milvus_R%28ThKraft%29.jpg
