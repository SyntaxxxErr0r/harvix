62.9	Jewish_holiday	Jewish holiday	The first ten days of seventh month of the Jewish year (from the beginning of Rosh Hashana until the end of Yom Kippur) are known as the Aseret Yemei Teshuva. During this time, in anticipation of Yom Kippur, it is "exceedingly appropriate" for Jews to practice teshuvah (literally "return"), an examination of one's deeds and repentance for sins one has committed against other people and God. This repentance can take the form of additional supplications, confessing one's deeds before God, fasting, and self-reflection. On the third day, the Fast of Gedalia is celebrated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/ShabbatcandlesC.jpg/220px-ShabbatcandlesC.jpg
