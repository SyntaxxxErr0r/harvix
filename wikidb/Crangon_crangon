Its common names include brown shrimp, common shrimp, bay shrimp, and sand shrimp, while translation of its French name (or its Dutch equivalent ) sometimes leads to the English version grey shrimp.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Crangon_crangon.jpg/220px-Crangon_crangon.jpg
