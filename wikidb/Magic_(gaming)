20.01	Magic_(gaming)	Magic (gaming)	Some role-playing games or game systems can include a set of rules that are used to portray magic in the paranormal sense. These rules simulate the effects that magic would have within the game context, according to how the game designer intended the magic to be portrayed. The rules can also be designed to balance the game play for the players, so as to not give any one participant an unfair advantage.
