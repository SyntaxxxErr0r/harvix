56.0	Northampton	Northampton	Original settlements in Northampton date back to the 6th century. Its modern development is largely due to its rapid population increase since the 1960s after a planned expansion occurred under the New Towns Commission in the early 1970s. In 2001, its urban area population was 197,199 while its town population was 189,474, making Northampton the 27th largest settlement in England, and the UK's 3rd largest town without official city status after Reading and Dudley. Northampton is the most populous district in England that is not a unitary authority, a status it failed to obtain in the 1990s local government reform.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Northampton_Guildhall01.JPG/250px-Northampton_Guildhall01.JPG
