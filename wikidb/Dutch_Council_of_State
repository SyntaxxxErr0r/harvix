12.21	Dutch_Council_of_State	Council of State of the Netherlands	In the Netherlands, the Council of State is a constitutionally established advisory body to the government which consists of members of the royal family and Crown-appointed members generally having political, commercial, diplomatic, or military experience. The Council of State must be consulted by the cabinet on proposed legislation before a law is submitted to the parliament. The Council of State Administrative Law section also serves as a court of appeal for citizens against executive branch decisions. The Queen is President of the Council of State but she seldom chairs meetings. The Vice-President of the Council of State chairs meetings in the Queens' absence. Under Dutch Constitutional Law the Vice-President of the Council is acting Head of State when there is no Monarch; e.g. if the Royal Family were to become extinct.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands_-_02.svg/150px-Coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands_-_02.svg.png
