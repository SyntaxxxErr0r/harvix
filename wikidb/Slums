13.40	Slums	Slum	A slum, as defined by United Nations agency UN-HABITAT, is a run-down area of a city characterized by substandard housing and squalor and lacking in tenure security. According to the United Nations, the percentage of urban dwellers living in slums decreased from 47 percent to 37 percent in the developing world between 1990 and 2005. However, due to rising population, and the rise especially in urban populations, the number of slum dwellers is rising. One billion people worldwide live in slums and the figure will likely grow to 2 billion by 2030.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Principaux_Bidonvilles.png/250px-Principaux_Bidonvilles.png
