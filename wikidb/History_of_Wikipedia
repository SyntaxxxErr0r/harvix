61.0	History_of_Wikipedia	History of Wikipedia	The earliest known proposal for an online encyclopedia was made by Rick Gates in 1993, but the concept of an open source web-based online encyclopedia was proposed by Richard Stallman around 1999. Wikipedia was formally launched on 15 January 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, using the concept and technology of a wiki pioneered by Ward Cunningham. Initially, Wikipedia was created to complement Nupedia, an online encyclopedia project edited solely by experts, by providing additional draft articles and ideas for it. Wikipedia quickly overtook Nupedia, becoming a global project in multiple languages and inspiring a wide range of additional reference projects. As of March 2012 , Wikipedia includes over 21 million freely usable articles in 284 languages, written by over 31 million registered users and countless anonymous contributors worldwide and visited monthly by around 14.5% of all internet users.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/EnwikipediaArt.PNG/350px-EnwikipediaArt.PNG
