1.00	Reflectance_Difference_Spectroscopy	Reflectance difference spectroscopy	Reflectance difference spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique which measures the difference in reflectance of two beams of light that are shone in normal incident on a surface with different linear polarizations. It is also known as reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS).
