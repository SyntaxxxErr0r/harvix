1.00	Pause_For_Thought	Wake Up to Wogan	Wake Up to Wogan (WUTW) was the most listened to radio show in the United Kingdom and the flagship breakfast programme broadcast on BBC Radio 2. The show was presented by Terry Wogan who fronted WUTW from 4 January 1993; he had previously presented the breakfast show between 1972 and 1984, but the title WUTW was only added at the start of his second term. On 7 September 2009, Wogan confirmed to his listeners that he would be leaving the show at the end of the year, with Chris Evans taking over the breakfast show from the 11th January 2010. The final show was broadcast on 18 December 2009. Regular stand in presenter Johnnie Walker would become interim host of the breakfast show for the three week period between Wogan's departure and Evans' arrival.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/WakeUpToWogan.jpg
