Autonomy was gained again in 2005, through the Comprehensive Peace Agreement meant to end the Second Sudanese Civil War, and the position of president of Southern Sudan was restored. Then, on 9 July, 2011, South Sudan became independent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Seal_of_South_Sudan.svg/125px-Seal_of_South_Sudan.svg.png
