1.30	Skorba_Temples	Skorba Temples	The Skorba temples are megalithic remains on the northern edge of Żebbiegħ, in Malta, which have provided detailed and informative insight into the earliest periods of Malta's neolithic culture. The site was only excavated in the early 1960s, rather late in comparison to other megalithic sites, some of which had been studied since the early 19th century. The site's importance has led to its listing as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a listing it shares with six other megalithic temples in Malta.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Skorba1.jpg/300px-Skorba1.jpg
