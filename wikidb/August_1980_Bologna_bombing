19.23	August_1980_Bologna_bombing	August 1980 Bologna bombing	The Bologna massacre (Italian: ) was a terrorist bombing of the Central Station at Bologna, Italy, on the morning of Saturday, 2 August 1980, which killed 85 people and wounded more than 200. The attack has been materially attributed to the neo-fascist terrorist organization Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari. Suspicions of the Italian secret service's involvement emerged shortly after, due to the explosives used for the bomb and the political climate in which the massacre occurred, but have never been proven.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Stragedibologna-2.jpg/220px-Stragedibologna-2.jpg
