60.1	Mediterranean_climate	Mediterranean climate	Under the Köppen climate classification, "dry-summer subtropical" climates (classified as Csa and Csb) are often referred to as "Mediterranean". Under the Köppen-Geiger system, "C" zones have an average temperature above 10 °C (50 °F) in their warmest months, and an average in the coldest between 18 °C (64 °F) and −3 °C. (26.6 °F) (or, in some applications, between 20 °C and 0 °C (32 °F)). The second letter indicates the precipitation pattern: "s" represents dry summers: first, Köppen has defined a dry month as a month with less than one-third that of the wettest winter month, and with less than 30 mm of precipitations in a summer month. Some, however, use a 40 mm level. The third letter indicates the degree of summer heat: "a" represents an average temperature in the warmest month above 22 °C (72 °F), with at least four months averaging above 10 °C (50 °F); "b", an average temperature in the warmest month below 22 °C, and again with at least two months averaging above 10 °C.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/KoppenclassificationworldmapCs.png/450px-KoppenclassificationworldmapCs.png
