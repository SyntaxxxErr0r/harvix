53.8	Alfred_P._Sloan	Alfred P. Sloan	Alfred Pritchard Sloan, Jr. (May 23, 1875 – February 17, 1966) was an American business executive in the automotive industry. He was a long-time president, chairman, and CEO of General Motors Corporation. Sloan, first as a senior executive and later as the peak of the organization, helped lead (and grow) GM from the 1920s through the 1950s—decades when concepts such as the annual model change, brand architecture, industrial design, automotive design (styling), and planned obsolescence transformed the industry, and when the industry changed lifestyles and the built environment in America and throughout the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/1101261227_400.jpg/220px-1101261227_400.jpg
