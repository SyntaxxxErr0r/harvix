Military expenditure figures are presented in US$ at either constant or current exchange rates, the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next. Currently, the worlds five largest military spenders are recognised to be world powers with each being a veto-wielding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Military_expenditure_by_country_map2.png/350px-Military_expenditure_by_country_map2.png
