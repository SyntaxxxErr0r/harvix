2.01	Bogdanov_affair	Bogdanov Affair	The Bogdanov Affair is an academic dispute regarding the legitimacy of a series of theoretical physics papers written by French twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanov (alternately spelt Bogdanoff). These papers were published in reputable scientific journals, and were alleged by their authors to culminate in a proposed theory for describing what occurred at the Big Bang. The controversy started in 2002 when rumors spread on Usenet newsgroups that the work was a deliberate hoax intended to target weaknesses in the peer review system employed by the physics community to select papers for publication in academic journals. While the Bogdanov brothers continue to defend the veracity of their work, a Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) internal report concluded that "the value of this work is nil". Some physicists have also treated this as evidence of the fallibility inherent within the peer review system. The debate over whether the work represented a contribution to physics, or instead was meaningless, spread from Usenet to many other Internet forums, including the blogs of notable physicists. The ensuing dispute received considerable coverage in the mainstream media.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/PHOTOS_IGOR_GRICHKA.jpg/220px-PHOTOS_IGOR_GRICHKA.jpg
