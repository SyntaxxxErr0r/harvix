51.3	Tyvek	Tyvek	Tyvek ( ) is a brand of flashspun high-density polyethylene fibers, a synthetic material; the name is a registered trademark of DuPont. The material is very strong; it is difficult to tear but can easily be cut with scissors or a knife. Water vapor can pass through Tyvek (highly breathable), but not liquid water, so the material lends itself to a variety of applications: envelopes, car covers, air and water intrusion barriers under house siding, labels, wristbands, mycology, and graphics. Tyvek is sometimes erroneously referred to as "Tyvex."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Tyvek_house_wrap.jpg/220px-Tyvek_house_wrap.jpg
