6.10	Shannon_information_theory	Information theory	Information theory is a branch of applied mathematics and electrical engineering involving the quantification of information. Information theory was developed by Claude E. Shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data. Since its inception it has broadened to find applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography generally, networks other than communication networks â€” as in neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, plagiarism detection and other forms of data analysis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Binary_entropy_plot.svg/200px-Binary_entropy_plot.svg.png
