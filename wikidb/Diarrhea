125.7	Diarrhea	Diarrhea	Diarrhea (from the Greek meaning "flowing through"), also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having three or more loose or liquid bowel movements per day. It is a common cause of death in developing countries and the second most common cause of infant deaths worldwide. The loss of fluids through diarrhea can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. In 2009 diarrhea was estimated to have caused 1.1 million deaths in people aged 5 and over and 1.5 million deaths in children under the age of 5. Oral rehydration solutions and zinc tablets are the treatment of choice and have been estimated to have saved 50 million children in the past 25 years. Homemade solutions recommended by WHO include salted drinks (e.g. salted rice water or a salted yoghurt drink) and vegetable or chicken soup with salt. If available, supplemental potassium, as well as supplemental zinc, can be added to or given with this homemade solution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Multiple_rotavirus_particles.jpg/220px-Multiple_rotavirus_particles.jpg
