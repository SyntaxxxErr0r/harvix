51.9	Ketubah	Ketubah	A ketubah is a special type of Jewish prenuptial agreement. It is considered an integral part of a traditional Jewish marriage, and outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom, in relation to the bride. Nevertheless, there is no agreement in modern times as to the monetary worth of the ketubah, and its enforceability even in Jewish courts is in question even in theory; in practice it is never enforced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/V03p128a01_Ketubah.jpg/250px-V03p128a01_Ketubah.jpg
