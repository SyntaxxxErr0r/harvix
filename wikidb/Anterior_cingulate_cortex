54.9	Anterior_cingulate_cortex	Anterior cingulate cortex	The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is the frontal part of the cingulate cortex, that resembles a "collar" form around the corpus callosum, the fibrous bundle that relays neural signals between the right and left cerebral hemispheres of the brain. It consists of Brodmann areas 24, 32 and 33. It appears to play a role in a wide variety of autonomic functions, such as regulating blood pressure and heart rate, as well as rational cognitive functions, such as reward anticipation, decision-making, empathy and emotion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Gray727_anterior_cingulate_cortex.png/250px-Gray727_anterior_cingulate_cortex.png
