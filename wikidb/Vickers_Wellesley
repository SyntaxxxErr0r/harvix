8.01	Vickers_Wellesley	Vickers Wellesley	The Vickers Wellesley was a British 1930s light bomber built by Vickers-Armstrongs at Brooklands near Weybridge, Surrey, for the Royal Air Force. While it was obsolete by the start of the Second World War, and unsuited to the European air war, the Wellesley was successfully used in the desert theatres of East Africa, Egypt and the Middle East.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Vickers_Wellesley.jpg/300px-Vickers_Wellesley.jpg
