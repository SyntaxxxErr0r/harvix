21.03	Huckleberry_Hound	Huckleberry Hound	Huckleberry "Huck" Hound is a fictional cartoon character, a blue dog that speaks with a Southern drawl and has a relaxed, sweet, and well-intentioned personality. He first appeared in the series The Huckleberry Hound Show. Huckleberry Hound's southern drawl and laid back mannerisms bear close resemblance to the character "Southern Wolf" in the MGM cartoons including those produced by Hanna and Barbera.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e3/Huckleberry_Hound_Title_Card.jpg
