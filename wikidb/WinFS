77.5	WinFS	WinFS	While WinFS and its shared type schema make it possible for an application to recognize the different data types, the application still has to be coded to render the different data types. Consequently, it would not allow development of a single application that can view or edit all data types; rather what WinFS enables applications to understand is the structure of all data and extract the information that it can use further. When WinFS was introduced at the 2003 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft also released a video presentation, named IWish, showing mockup interfaces that showed how applications would expose interfaces that take advantage of a unified type system. The concepts shown in the video ranged from applications using the relationships of items to dynamically offer filtering options to applications grouping multiple related data types and rendering them in a unified presentation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/WinFSCalendar.png/225px-WinFSCalendar.png
