165.0	Solar_power	Solar power	Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP). Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaics convert light into electric current using the photoelectric effect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/PS10_solar_power_tower.jpg/275px-PS10_solar_power_tower.jpg
