179.2	Breast_cancer	Breast cancer	Breast cancer is a type of cancer originating from breast tissue, most commonly from the inner lining of milk ducts or the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers originating from ducts are known as ductal carcinomas; those originating from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. Breast cancer is a disease of humans and other mammals; while the overwhelming majority of cases in humans are women, men can sometimes also develop breast cancer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Mammo_breast_cancer.jpg/230px-Mammo_breast_cancer.jpg
