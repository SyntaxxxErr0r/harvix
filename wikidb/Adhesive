69.9	Adhesive	Adhesive	An adhesive or glue is a material, usually in a liquid or semi-liquid state, that adheres or bonds items together. Adhesives come from either natural or synthetic sources. The types of materials that can be bonded are vast but they are especially useful for bonding thin materials. Adhesives cure (harden) by either evaporating a solvent or by chemical reactions that occur between two or more constituents.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/AdhesivesForHouseUse004.jpg/220px-AdhesivesForHouseUse004.jpg
