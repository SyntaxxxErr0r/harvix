128.4	Epigenetics	Epigenetics	In biology, and specifically genetics, epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence – hence the name epi- (Greek: επί- over, above, outer) -genetics. It refers to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such changes are DNA methylation and histone modification, both of which serve to regulate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Epigenetic_mechanisms.jpg/300px-Epigenetic_mechanisms.jpg
