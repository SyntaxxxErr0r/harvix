162.4	Super_Bowl	Super Bowl	The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in the United States, culminating a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. The Super Bowl uses Roman numerals to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season, while the most recent game, Super Bowl XLVI, was played on February 5, 2012, to determine the champion of the 2011 season.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Super_Bowl_29_Vince_Lombardi_trophy_at_49ers_Family_Day_2009.JPG/200px-Super_Bowl_29_Vince_Lombardi_trophy_at_49ers_Family_Day_2009.JPG
