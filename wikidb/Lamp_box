1.20	Lamp_box	Lamp box	Lamp boxes are the smallest of the post boxes used by the Royal Mail in the UK, by its counterparts in the Commonwealth of Nations and also by An Post in Ireland. Their name derives from the fact that they were designed to be affixed to lamp posts, although they may equally be found embedded in walls or mounted on poles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Lamp_box.jpg/200px-Lamp_box.jpg
