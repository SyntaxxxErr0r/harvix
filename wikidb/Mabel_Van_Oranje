1.00	Mabel_Van_Oranje	Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau	Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau is the wife of Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau (second son of Queen Beatrix and the late Prince Claus of the Netherlands). On February 17, 2012, while skiing in Austria, Prince Friso was buried in an avalanche, and, although found and resuscitated, suffered severe brain damage. He is, as of this writing, March 26, 2012, in a coma, and unlikely to regain consciousness. The prince was moved from the hospital in Innsbruck, Austria, to a facility in London, where he lived with his wife, Princess Mabel, and their two children. During his stay in the hospital in Innsbruck, he was visited every day by members of his family. Especially sad and moving was the close relationship shown between his mother, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, and Princess Mabel, who were repeatedly seen holding on tightly and supporting each other, as they entered and left the hospital.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands.svg/140px-Coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png
