1.00	12_equal_temperament	Equal temperament	An equal temperament is a musical temperament, or a system of tuning, in which every pair of adjacent notes has an identical frequency ratio. As pitch is perceived roughly as the logarithm of frequency, this means that the perceived "distance" from every note to its nearest neighbor is the same for every note in the system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Chromatische_toonladder.png/300px-Chromatische_toonladder.png
