86.3	ETA	ETA	ETA , an acronym for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (Basque pronunciation: ; "Basque Homeland and Freedom") is an armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization. The group was founded in 1959 and has since evolved from a group promoting traditional Basque culture to a paramilitary group with the goal of gaining independence for the Greater Basque Country. ETA is the main organisation of the Basque National Liberation Movement and is the most important participant in the Basque conflict. ETA declared ceasefires in 1989, 1996, 1998 and 2006, but subsequently broke them. However, on 5 September 2010, ETA declared a new ceasefire that is still in force â€“ moreover, on 20 October 2011 ETA announced a "definitive cessation of its armed activity".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Eta_logo.jpg
