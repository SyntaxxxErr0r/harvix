13.61	Hortus_conclusus	Hortus conclusus	Hortus conclusus is a Latin term, meaning literally "enclosed garden". "The word 'garden' is at root the same as the word 'yard'. It means an enclosure", observed Derek Clifford, at the outset of a series of essays on garden design, in which he skirted the conventions of the hortus conclusus. Thus, at their root, both of the words in hortus conclusus refer linguistically to enclosure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Fra_Angelico_043.jpg/220px-Fra_Angelico_043.jpg
