104.7	Black_Panther_Party	Black Panther Party	The Black Panther Party (originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense) was an African-American revolutionary leftist organization active in the United States from 1966 until 1982. The Black Panther Party achieved national and international notoriety through its involvement in the Black Power movement and U.S. politics of the 1960s and 1970s. The group's "provocative rhetoric, militant posture, and cultural and political flourishes permanently altered the contours of American Identity."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Bpp_logo.PNG/220px-Bpp_logo.PNG
