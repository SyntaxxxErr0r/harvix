Although Australia is often loosely said to have been discovered by Royal Navy Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook in 1770, he was merely one of a number of European explorers to have sighted and landed on the continent prior to English settlement, and he did so 164 years after the first such documented encounter. Nor did the exploration of Australia end with Cook; explorers by land and sea continued to survey the continent for many years after settlement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Australia_discoveries_by_Europeans_before_1813_en.png/200px-Australia_discoveries_by_Europeans_before_1813_en.png
