114.5	Book_of_Kells	Book of Kells	The Book of Kells is an illuminated manuscript Gospel book in Latin, containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables. It was created by Celtic monks ca. 800 or slightly earlier. The text of the Gospels is largely drawn from the Vulgate, although it also includes several passages drawn from the earlier versions of the Bible known as the Vetus Latina. It is a masterwork of Western calligraphy and represents the pinnacle of Insular illumination. It is also widely regarded as Ireland's finest national treasure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg/220px-KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg
