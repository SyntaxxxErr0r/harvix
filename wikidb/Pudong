50.9	Pudong	Pudong	Pudong (Chinese: ; pinyin: Pǔdōng, lit "Huangpu East Bank") is an area of Shanghai, China, located along the east side of the Huangpu River, across from the historic city center of Shanghai in Puxi. Formerly a little-developed agricultural area linked only by ferries, Pudong has grown rapidly since the 1990s and emerged as China's financial and commercial hub. It is principally administered as the Pudong New Area, a district of Shanghai.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/2012_New_Year_Night_Pudong.jpg/250px-2012_New_Year_Night_Pudong.jpg
