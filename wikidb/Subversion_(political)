6.12	Subversion_(political)	Subversion	Subversion refers to an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power, authority, and hierarchy. A subversive is something or someone carrying the potential for some degree of subversion. In this context, a "subversive" is sometimes called a "traitor" with respect to (and usually by) the government in-power. Subversion can imply the use of insidious, dishonest, monetary, or violent methods to bring about such change. This is in contrast to protest, a coup d'Ã©tat, or working through traditional means (if) available in a political system to bring about change.
