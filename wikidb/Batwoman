60.4	Batwoman	Batwoman	Batwoman (originally referred to as the Bat-Woman) is the name of several fictional characters who act as female counterparts to the superhero Batman but are older than the popular character Batgirl. The original Batwoman was created by Bob Kane and Sheldon Moldoff. Her alter ego is Kathy Kane. This character appears in publications produced by DC Comics and related media beginning in Detective Comics #233 (1956). The character was introduced as a love interest for Batman to disprove allegations of homosexuality in response to the backlash from the book Seduction of the Innocent (1954). When Julius Schwartz became editor of the Batman-related comic books in 1964, he removed non-essential characters including Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Bat-Mite, and Bat-Hound. Later, the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths retroactively established that Batwoman has never existed, though her alter ego Kathy Kane continued to be referred to occasionally.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Comic_image_missing.svg/125px-Comic_image_missing.svg.png
