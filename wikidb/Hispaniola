73.1	Hispaniola	Hispaniola	Hispaniola is a major island in the Caribbean, containing the two sovereign states of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The island is located between the islands of Cuba to the west and Puerto Rico to the east, within the hurricane belt. Hispaniola is perhaps most famous as the site of the first European colonies in the New World, colonies founded by Christopher Columbus on his voyages in 1492 and 1493. It is the ninth-most-populous island in the world, and the most populous in the Americas. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean (after Cuba) and the 22nd-largest island in the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/View_of_Haitian_Landscape_hispaniola.jpg/220px-View_of_Haitian_Landscape_hispaniola.jpg
