The sub-munitions are designed for both antiarmor and antipersonnel attack. Some sub-munitions may be designed for delayed reaction or mobility denial . The air-to-surface variety of this kind of munition is better known as a cluster bomb. They are banned in some countries under the Convention on Cluster Munitions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/M77_Cluster_Munition_With_Hand.jpg/300px-M77_Cluster_Munition_With_Hand.jpg
