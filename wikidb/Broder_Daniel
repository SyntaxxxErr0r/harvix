8.40	Broder_Daniel	Broder Daniel	Broder Daniel (often abbreviated BD) was an alternative rock band from Gothenburg, Sweden. They formed in the late 1980s and then consisted of classmates Henrik Berggren and Daniel Gilbert. The band claims they started playing "to gain social respect" and it was decided early on that emotional expression would be more important to their sound than musical correctness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Broder_daniel_%28cropped%29.jpeg/220px-Broder_daniel_%28cropped%29.jpeg
