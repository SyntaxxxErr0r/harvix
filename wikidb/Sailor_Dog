1.00	Sailor_Dog	Scupper	A scupper is an opening in the side walls of an open-air structure, for purposes of draining water. They are usually placed at or near ground level, and allow rain or liquids to flow off the side of the open-air structure, instead of pooling within the walls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Scuppers.jpg/220px-Scuppers.jpg
