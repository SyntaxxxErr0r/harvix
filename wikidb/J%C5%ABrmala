13.61	J%C5%ABrmala	Jūrmala	While Latvia was a part of the Soviet Union, Jūrmala was a favorite holiday-resort and tourist destination for high-level Communist Party officials, particularly Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Khrushchev. Although many amenities such as beach-houses and concrete hotels remain, some have fallen into disrepair. Jūrmala remains a tourist attraction with long beaches facing the Gulf of Riga and romantic wooden houses in the Art Nouveau style.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Herbstnebel.jpg/250px-Herbstnebel.jpg
