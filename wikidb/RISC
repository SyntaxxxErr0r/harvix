87.9	RISC	Reduced instruction set computing	Reduced instruction set computing, or RISC ( ), is a CPU design strategy based on the insight that simplified (as opposed to complex) instructions can provide higher performance if this simplicity enables much faster execution of each instruction. A computer based on this strategy is a reduced instruction set computer also called RISC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/KL_Sun_UltraSparc.jpg/220px-KL_Sun_UltraSparc.jpg
