8.01	Dansk_Folkeparti	Danish People's Party	The Danish People's Party (Danish: , DF) is a political party in Denmark which is frequently described as right-wing populist by political scientists and commentators. The party is led by Pia Kjærsgaard. Since the Parliamentary election in 2001 the party has supported a government consisting of the Liberal and Conservative parties, and these were in power until the election in 2011 (where a coalition of center-left parties won). While not being a part of the cabinet, the Danish People's Party maintained a close cooperation with the 2001–2011 government parties on most issues. In return for their parliamentary cooperation, the party required support for their political stances.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/Danish_Peoples_Party_logo.svg/250px-Danish_Peoples_Party_logo.svg.png
