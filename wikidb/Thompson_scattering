1.02	Thompson_scattering	Thomson scattering	The electric fields of the incoming and observed beam can be divided up into those components lying in the plane of observation (formed by the incoming and observed beams) and those components perpendicular to that plane. Those components lying in the plane are referred to as "radial" and those perpendicular to the plane are "tangential", since this is how they appear to the observer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Thomson_scattering_geometry.png
