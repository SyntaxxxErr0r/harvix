51.9	Metallurgy	Metallurgy	Metallurgy is a domain of materials science that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their intermetallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are called alloys. It is also the technology of metals: the way in which science is applied to their practical use. Metallurgy is distinguished from the craft of metalworking.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Georg_Agricola.jpg/200px-Georg_Agricola.jpg
