1.40	U.S._Highway_2	U.S. Route 2	U.S. Route 2 is an eastâ€“west U.S. Highway spanning 2,579 miles (4,150 km) across the northern continental United States. US 2 consists of two segments connected by various roadways in southern Canada. Unlike some routes, which are disconnected into segments because of encroaching Interstate Highways, the two portions of US 2 were designed to be separate in the original 1926 highway plan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/US_2_map.png/285px-US_2_map.png
