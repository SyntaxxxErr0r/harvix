Several important political and technological developments led Brazil to became the world leader in the sustainable use of bioethanol, and a policy model for other developing countries in the tropical zone of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. Government policies and technological advances also allowed the country to achieve a landmark in ethanol consumption, when ethanol retail sales surpassed 50% market share of the gasoline-powered vehicle fleet in early 2008. This level of ethanol fuel consumption had only been reached in Brazil once before, at the peak of the Pró-Álcool Program near the end of the 1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Canaviais_Piracicaba_05_2009_5809.JPG/220px-Canaviais_Piracicaba_05_2009_5809.JPG
