138.6	Schengen_Agreement	Schengen Agreement	The Schengen Agreement is a treaty signed on 14 June 1985 near the town of Schengen in Luxembourg, between five of the ten member states of the European Economic Community. It was supplemented by the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement 5 years later. Together these treaties created Europe's borderless Schengen Area, which operates very much like a single state for international travel with external border controls for travellers travelling in and out of the area, but with no internal border controls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Schengen_Monument.jpg/200px-Schengen_Monument.jpg
