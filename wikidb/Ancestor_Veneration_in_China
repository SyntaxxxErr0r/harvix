It is a way of continuing to show respect toward them, and it reinforces the unity of family and lineage. Showing respect to ancestors is an ideology deeply rooted in Chinese society. It is based on the idea of filial piety (孝, xiào) put forth by Confucius. Filial piety is the concept of remaining loyal to parents as their child. It is believed that despite the death of a loved one, the original relationship remains intact, and that the deceased possess more spiritual power than they did during life. In a sense, the ancestors became thought of as deities who had the ability to interact and have an effect on the lives of those still living.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Sifangcheng_bixi_-_right_front_-_P1060418.JPG/220px-Sifangcheng_bixi_-_right_front_-_P1060418.JPG
