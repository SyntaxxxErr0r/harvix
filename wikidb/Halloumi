66.7	Halloumi	Halloumi	Halloumi is a Cypriot semi-hard, unripened brined cheese made from a mixture of goats' and sheep milk, and sometimes also cows' milk. It has a high melting point and so can easily be fried or grilled. Halloumi is set with rennet and is unusual in that no acid or acid-producing bacterium is used in its preparation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Grilled_Halloumi_.jpg/220px-Grilled_Halloumi_.jpg
