1.00	Bluebelly	Western fence lizard	The western fence lizard is a common lizard of California and the surrounding area. Because the ventral abdomen of an adult is characteristically blue, it is also known as the blue-belly. Immature western fence lizards have aquamarine-colored bellies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Sceloporus_occidentalis_08290.JPG/250px-Sceloporus_occidentalis_08290.JPG
