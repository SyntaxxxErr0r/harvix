77.4	Lady_Godiva	Lady Godiva	Godiva (Old English: , "god gift"), often referred to as Lady Godiva, was an 11th century Anglo-Saxon noblewoman who, according to legend, rode naked through the streets of Coventry in order to gain a remission of the oppressive taxation imposed by her husband on his tenants. The name "Peeping Tom" for a voyeur originates from later versions of this legend in which a man named Tom had watched her ride and was struck blind or dead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Lady_Godiva_by_John_Collier.jpg/220px-Lady_Godiva_by_John_Collier.jpg
