1.00	Disease_in_ornamental_fish	Disease in ornamental fish	Due to the artificially limited volume of water and high concentration of fish in most aquarium tanks, communicable diseases often affect most or all fish in a tank. An improper nitrogen cycle, inappropriate aquarium plants and potentially harmful freshwater invertebrates can directly harm or add to the stresses on ornamental fish in a tank. Despite this, many diseases in captive fish can be avoided or prevented through proper water conditions and a well-adjusted ecosystem within the tank.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Aquarium_Nitrogen_Cycle.png/120px-Aquarium_Nitrogen_Cycle.png
