134.4	Falsifiability	Falsifiability	Falsifiability or refutability of an assertion, hypothesis or theory is the logical possibility that it can be contradicted by an observation or the outcome of a physical experiment. That something is "falsifiable" does not mean it is false; rather, that if it is false, then some observation or experiment will produce a reproducible result that is in conflict with it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Black_Swans.jpg/300px-Black_Swans.jpg
