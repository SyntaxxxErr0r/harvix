A pivot point is calculated as an average of significant prices (high, low, close) from the performance of a market in the prior trading period. If the market in the following period trades above the pivot point it is usually evaluated as a bullish sentiment, whereas trading below the pivot point is seen as bearish.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Pivot_point_DJI2009_8M1d.png/500px-Pivot_point_DJI2009_8M1d.png
