1.00	Ryder_(band)	Ryder (band)	Ryder was a purpose-made pop group led by Maynard Williams whose primary purpose was to represent the United Kingdom at the 1986 Eurovision Song Contest in Bergen, Norway. Ryder performed the song "Runner in the Night" which was placed 7th. They were criticised in the media for being a particularly weak and unsuitable entry. The song failed to reach the UK's top 75 chart (peaking in the 'bubbling under' section)- the first entry to do so since 1964.
