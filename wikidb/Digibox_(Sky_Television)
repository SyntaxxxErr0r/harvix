3.20	Digibox_(Sky_Television)	Digibox	The Digibox is a device marketed by British Sky Broadcasting in the UK and Republic of Ireland to enable home users to receive digital satellite television broadcasts (satellite receiver) from the Astra satellites at 28.2Â° east. An internet service is also available through the device, similar in some ways to the American MSN TV. The first Digiboxes shipped to consumers in mid-1998, and the hardware reference design is unchanged since. Compared to other satellite receivers, they are severely restricted.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/Sky-digibox.jpg/400px-Sky-digibox.jpg
