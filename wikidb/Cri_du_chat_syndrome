Its name is a French term referring to the characteristic cat-like cry of affected children. It was first described by Jérôme Lejeune in 1963. The condition affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 live births, strikes all ethnicities, and is more common in females by a 4:3 ratio.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Criduchat.jpg/230px-Criduchat.jpg
