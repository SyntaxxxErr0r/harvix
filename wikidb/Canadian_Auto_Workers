While rooted in Ontario's large auto plants of Windsor, Brampton, Oakville, St. Catharines and Oshawa, the CAW has in recent years expanded and now incorporates workers in industries from fisheries to air travel. The current president of the CAW is Ken Lewenza.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/Caw_logo.png
