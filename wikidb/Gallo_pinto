18.42	Gallo_pinto	Gallo pinto	Gallo pinto or gallopinto is a traditional dish of Nicaragua and some provinces of Costa Rica, mainly close to the Nicaraguan border (Guanacaste, a former Nicaraguan territory) made with rice and beans. The dish contains more rice than beans. The history of gallo pinto is not well known, and there are disputes between Costa Ricans and Nicaraguans about where the dish originated. One theory suggests that gallo pinto was brought into Latin America by Afro-Latino immigrants. Most Latin Americans agree that the dish is part of both countries now and that they share more similarities than differences. Variations of gallo pinto are popular in many countries close to the Caribbean.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Costa_Rican_Gallo_Pinto.jpg/300px-Costa_Rican_Gallo_Pinto.jpg
