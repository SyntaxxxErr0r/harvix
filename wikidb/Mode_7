35.06	Mode_7	Mode 7	Mode 7 is a graphics mode on the Super NES video game console and the Sega CD addon for the Genesis that allows a background layer to be rotated and scaled on a scanline-by-scanline basis to create many different effects. The most famous of these effects is the application of a perspective effect on a background layer by scaling and rotating the background layer in this manner. This transforms the background layer into a 2-dimensional horizontal texture-mapped plane that trades height for depth. Thus, an impression of 3-dimensional graphics is achieved.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Mode_7_Test-0000.png
