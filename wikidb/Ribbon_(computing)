97.2	Ribbon_(computing)	Ribbon (computing)	In GUI-based application software, a ribbon is an interface where a set of toolbars are placed on tabs in a tab bar. Recent releases of some Microsoft applications have popularized this form with a modular ribbon as their main interface. The Ribbon GUI provides the user interface of an application with a large toolbar filled with graphical representations of control elements which are grouped by different functionality. The Ribbon can also contain tabs to expose different sets of control elements, eliminating the need for many different icon-based tool bars. Some of these tabs are contextual and appear only when a certain type of object is selected, providing specific tools for items such as tables or images.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Word2010Ribbon.png/450px-Word2010Ribbon.png
