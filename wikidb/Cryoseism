4.10	Cryoseism	Cryoseism	A cryoseism, also known as a frost quake, may be caused by a sudden cracking action in frozen soil or rock saturated with water or ice. As water seeps down into the rock, it freezes and expands, putting stress on surrounding rock. This builds up until it is relieved explosively in a cryoseism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/US_states_with_reported_cryoseisms.PNG/300px-US_states_with_reported_cryoseisms.PNG
