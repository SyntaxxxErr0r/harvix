76.9	Orrery	Orrery	An orrery is a mechanical device that illustrates the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons in the Solar System in a heliocentric model. Though the Greeks had working planetaria, the first orrery that was a planetarium of the modern era was produced in 1704, and one was presented to the Earl of Orrery â€” whence the name came. They are typically driven by a clockwork mechanism with a globe representing the Sun at the centre, and with a planet at the end of each of the arms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Orrery_small.jpg/220px-Orrery_small.jpg
