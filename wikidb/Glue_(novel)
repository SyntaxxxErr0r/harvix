7.10	Glue_(novel)	Glue (novel)	Glue is a 2001 novel by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh. Glue tells the stories of four Scottish boys over four decades, through the use of different perspectives and different voices. It addresses sex, drugs, violence, and other social issues in Scotland, mapping “the furious energies of working-class masculinity in the late 20th century, using a compulsive mixture of Lothians dialect, libertarian socialist theory, and an irresistible black humour.” The title refers not to the abuse of adhesives, but the metaphorical glue holding the four together through changing times.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/70/IrvineWelshGlue.jpg/200px-IrvineWelshGlue.jpg
