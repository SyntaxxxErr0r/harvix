12.02	Sakura_(folk_song)	Sakura Sakura	"Sakura Sakura" ), also known as "Sakura", is a traditional Japanese folk song depicting spring, the season of cherry blossoms. Contrary to popular belief, the song did not originate in ancient times; it was a popular, urban melody of the Edo period and was adopted as a piece for beginning koto students in the Tokyo Academy of Music Collection of Japanese Koto Music issued in 1888 (in English) by the Department of Education. The song has been popular since the Meiji period, and the lyrics in their present form were attached then. It is often sung in international settings as a song representative of Japan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Sakura.song.png/220px-Sakura.song.png
