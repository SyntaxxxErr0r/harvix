4.00	.NET_assemblies	.NET assembly	In the .NET framework, an assembly is a compiled code library used for deployment, versioning, and security. There are two types: process assemblies and library assemblies (DLL). A process assembly represents a process that will use classes defined in library assemblies. .NET assemblies contain code in CIL, which is usually generated from a CLI language, and then compiled into machine language at run time by the CLR just-in-time compiler.
