51.4	Rotoscope	Rotoscoping	Rotoscoping is an animation technique in which animators trace over live-action film movement, frame by frame, for use in animated films. Originally, recorded live-action film images were projected onto a frosted glass panel and re-drawn by an animator. This projection equipment is called a rotoscope, although this device has been replaced by computers in recent years. In the visual effects industry, the term rotoscoping refers to the technique of manually creating a matte for an element on a live-action plate so it may be composited over another background.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/US_patent_1242674_figure_3.png/200px-US_patent_1242674_figure_3.png
