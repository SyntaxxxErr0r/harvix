2.00	Madalyn_Aslan	Madalyn Aslan	Madalyn Aslan (born October 5, 1963 in San Francisco) is an American writer, astrologer, and palmist. She is the author of Madalyn Aslan's Jupiter Signs, What's Your Sign?, and CosmoGirl Astrologer. In 1999, The New York Times proclaimed her "The Love Guru", and stated: "Ms. Aslan sees subtle detail that others don't...with the gently practiced air of a surgeon." After 2001, Madalyn began reading over the phone so she could read anyone in the world, anywhere, and this is how she conducts all of her readings today. She has been included in Who's Who in America and Who's Who in the World, the first American palmist to be so.
