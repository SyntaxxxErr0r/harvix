103.0	Thylacine	Thylacine	The thylacine ( -lə-syn, or -lə-seen, also ; binomial name: Thylacinus cynocephalus, Greek for "dog-headed pouched one") was the largest known carnivorous marsupial of modern times. It is commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger (because of its striped back) or the Tasmanian wolf. Native to continental Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea, it is thought to have become extinct in the 20th century. It was the last extant member of its family, Thylacinidae, although several related species have been found in the fossil record dating back to the early Miocene.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Thylacinus.jpg/300px-Thylacinus.jpg
