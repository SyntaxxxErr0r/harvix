132.8	Jatropha	Jatropha	Jatropha is a genus of approximately 175 succulent plants, shrubs and trees (some are deciduous, like Jatropha curcas), from the family Euphorbiaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words ἰατρός , meaning "physician," and τροφή (trophe), meaning "nutrition," hence the common name physic nut. Mature plants produce separate male and female flowers. As with many members of the family Euphorbiaceae, Jatropha contains compounds that are highly toxic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Belize3.jpg/220px-Belize3.jpg
