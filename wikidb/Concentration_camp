80.2	Concentration_camp	Internment	Internment is the imprisonment or confinement of people, commonly in large groups, without trial. The Oxford English Dictionary (1989) gives the meaning as: "The action of 'interning'; confinement within the limits of a country or place." Most modern usage is about individuals, and there is a distinction between internment, which is being confined usually for preventive or political reasons, and imprisonment, which is being closely confined as a punishment for crime.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Japanese_internment_camp_in_British_Columbia.jpg/220px-Japanese_internment_camp_in_British_Columbia.jpg
