2.12	Jacques_Marchais_Museum_of_Tibetan_Art	Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art	The Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art, located on residential Lighthouse Hill in the Egbertville neighborhood of Staten Island, New York City, United States, is home to one of the United States' most extensive collections of Himalayan artifacts. The museum was created by Jacques Marchais, an American woman, to serve as a bridge between the West and the rich ancient and cultural traditions of Tibet and the Himalayan region. Marchais designed her educational center to be an all-encompassing experience: it was built to resemble a rustic Himalayan monastery with extensive terraced gardens and grounds and a fish and lotus pond. The museum was praised for its authenticity by the Dalai Lama who visited in 1991. A writer in the New York Times referred to the museums's founder under the name Jacqueline Klauber, noting that she used Marchais as her professional name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Marchais_Museum_LH_Av_jeh.JPG/250px-Marchais_Museum_LH_Av_jeh.JPG
