3.00	Amyloid_plaque	Amyloid	Amyloids are insoluble fibrous protein aggregates sharing specific structural traits. They arise from at least 18 inappropriately folded proteins and polypeptides present naturally in the body. These misfolded structures alter their proper configuration such that they erroneously interact with one another or other cell components forming insoluble fibrils. They have been associated with the pathology of more than 20 serious human diseases in that, abnormal accumulation of amyloid fibrils in organs may lead to amyloidosis, and may play a role in various neurodegenerative disorders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Small_bowel_duodenum_with_amyloid_deposition_20X.jpg/220px-Small_bowel_duodenum_with_amyloid_deposition_20X.jpg
