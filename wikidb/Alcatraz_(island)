2.00	Alcatraz_(island)	Alcatraz Island	Alcatraz Island is an island located in the San Francisco Bay, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) offshore from San Francisco, California, United States. Often referred to as "The Rock", the small island was developed with facilities for a lighthouse, a military fortification, a military prison, and a Federal Bureau of Prisons federal prison until March 21, 1963. Beginning in November 1969, the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of American Indians from San Francisco who were part of a wave of Indian activism across the nation with public protests through the 1970s. In 1972 Alcatraz became a national recreation area and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Alcatraz_dawn_2005-01-07.jpg/284px-Alcatraz_dawn_2005-01-07.jpg
