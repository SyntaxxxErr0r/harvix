64.6	Trigonometry	Trigonometry	Trigonometry (from Greek trig≈çnon "triangle" + metron "measure") is a branch of mathematics that studies triangles and the relationships between their sides and the angles between these sides. Trigonometry defines the trigonometric functions, which describe those relationships and have applicability to cyclical phenomena, such as waves. The field evolved during the third century BC as a branch of geometry used extensively for astronomical studies. It is also the foundation of the practical art of surveying.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/STS-114_Steve_Robinson_on_Canadarm2.jpg/220px-STS-114_Steve_Robinson_on_Canadarm2.jpg
