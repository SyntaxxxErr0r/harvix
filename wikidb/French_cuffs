1.00	French_cuffs	Cuff	A cuff is an extra layer of fabric at the lower edge of the sleeve of a garment covering the arms. In US usage the word may also refer to the end of the leg of a pair of trousers. The functional purpose of turned cuffs is to protect the material from fraying and, when frayed, to allow the cuffs to be repaired or replaced without major changes to the garment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/French_cuff.JPG/220px-French_cuff.JPG
