94.7	Left-wing_politics	Left-wing politics	In politics, the Left, left-wing and leftist generally refer to support for social change to create a more egalitarian society. They usually involve a concern for those in society who are disadvantaged relative to others and an assumption that there are unjustified inequalities (which right-wing politics view as natural or traditional) that should be reduced or abolished. The terms Left and Right were coined during the French Revolution, referring to the seating arrangement in the Estates General; those who sat on the left generally supported the radical changes of the revolution, including the creation of a republic and secularization. Use of the term "Left" became more prominent after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815 when it was applied to the "Independents". The term was then applied to a number of revolutionary movements, especially socialism, anarchism and communism as well as more reformist movements such as social democracy and social liberalism.
