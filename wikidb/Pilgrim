Typically, this is a physical journeying (often on foot) to some place of special significance to the adherent of a particular religious belief system. In the spiritual literature of Christianity, the concept of pilgrim and pilgrimage may refer to the experience of life in the world (considered as a period of exile) or to the inner path of the spiritual aspirant from a state of wretchedness to a state of beatitude.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Gheorghe_Tattarescu_-_Pelerin.jpg/170px-Gheorghe_Tattarescu_-_Pelerin.jpg
