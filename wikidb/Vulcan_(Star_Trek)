77.2	Vulcan_(Star_Trek)	Vulcan (Star Trek)	Vulcans are an extraterrestrial humanoid species in the Star Trek universe who evolved on the planet Vulcan, and are noted for their attempt to live by reason and logic with no interference from emotion. They were the first extraterrestrial species in the Star Trek universe to observe First Contact protocol with Humans. They gave massive assistance to a devastated post-World War 3 Earth, enabling the planet to eliminate poverty, disease and suffering within a single century. For this reason, Humans even in the 24th century view Vulcans in many ways as their best friends â€” "the good guys," as told to Zefram Cochrane in 'First Contact' by the crew of the time travelling USS Enterprise-E. They later became one of the founding members of the United Federation of Planets. Vulcans appear in all six Star Trek series, four of which feature a Vulcan or a half-Vulcan as a main character.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Spock_vulcan-salute.png/200px-Spock_vulcan-salute.png
