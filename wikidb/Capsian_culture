1.43	Capsian_culture	Capsian culture	The Capsian culture (named after the town of Gafsa in Tunisia) was a Mesolithic culture of the Maghreb, which lasted from about 10,000 to 6,000 BCE. It was concentrated mainly in modern Tunisia, and Algeria, with some sites attested in southern Spain to Sicily. It is traditionally divided into two horizons, the Capsien typique (Typical Capsian) and the Capsien sup√©rieur (Upper Capsian) which are sometimes found in chronostratigraphic sequence. They represent variants of one tradition, the differences between them being both typological and technological.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Iberomaurisiense-Capsiense_.png/300px-Iberomaurisiense-Capsiense_.png
