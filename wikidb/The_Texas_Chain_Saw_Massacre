52.0	The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre	The Texas Chain Saw Massacre	The Texas Chain Saw Massacre note 1 is a 1974 American independent horror film directed and produced by Tobe Hooper, who cowrote it with Kim Henkel. It stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow, and Gunnar Hansen, who respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor, and Leatherface, the main antagonist. The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. Although it was marketed as a true story to attract a wider audience and as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate, its plot is entirely fictional; however the character of Leatherface and minor plot details were inspired by the crimes of real-life murderer Ed Gein.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/07/TheTexasChainSawMassacre-poster.jpg/220px-TheTexasChainSawMassacre-poster.jpg
