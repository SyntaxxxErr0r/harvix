86.0	Tattoo	Tattoo	A tattoo is a form of body modification, made by inserting indelible ink into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. The first written reference to the word, "tattoo" (or Samoan "Tatau") appears in the journal of Joseph Banks, the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: "I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Body_art%2C_1907.jpg/220px-Body_art%2C_1907.jpg
