At this point the river is sometimes called the Isis. The bridge carries the B4495 road (Donnington Bridge Road) from Abingdon Road to Iffley Road. It crosses the river on the reach between Iffley Lock and Osney Lock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Donnington_Bridge.jpg/250px-Donnington_Bridge.jpg
