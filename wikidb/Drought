64.6	Drought	Drought	A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply whether surface or underground water. Generally, this occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation. It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region. Although droughts can persist for several years, even a short, intense drought can cause significant damage and harm the local economy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Fields_outside_benambra.jpg/250px-Fields_outside_benambra.jpg
