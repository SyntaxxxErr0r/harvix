1.10	History_of_Italy_as_a_republic	History of the Italian Republic	After World War II and the overthrow of Mussolini's fascist regime, Italy's history was dominated by the Christian Democracy (Democrazia Cristiana, DC) political party for 50 years, while the opposition was led by the Italian Communist Party (PCI); this situation prevailed until the crisis of the Soviet Union and the Tangentopoli scandal and operation Mani pulite, which led to the reform of the electoral system (from almost perfect proportional to uninominal/multi-seat circumscriptions) and radical restructuring of the Italian political system, including the dissolution of most traditional political parties.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg/100px-Flag_of_Italy.svg.png
