63.5	Psychoacoustics	Psychoacoustics	The human ear can nominally hear sounds in the range 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). The upper limit tends to decrease with age; most adults are unable to hear above 16 kHz. The lowest frequency that has been identified as a musical tone is 12 Hz under ideal laboratory conditions. Tones between 4 and 16 Hz can be perceived via the body's sense of touch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Perceived_Human_Hearing.png/220px-Perceived_Human_Hearing.png
