4.11	Encelia	Encelia	Encelia is a genus of the plant family Asteraceae. It consists of shrubs (and one geophyte) of arid environments in southwestern North America and western South America. All have n = 18 chromosomes. With the exception of the South American species, all are obligate outcrossers. In cultivation, the species readily form fertile F1 hybrids, F2s, and backcrosses, but in natural areas of sympatry, F2s and backcrosses are absent or rare.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Encelia_farinosa_form.jpg/220px-Encelia_farinosa_form.jpg
