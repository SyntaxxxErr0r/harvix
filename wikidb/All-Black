1.00	All-Black	New Zealand national rugby union team	The New Zealand men's national rugby union team, known as the All Blacks, represent New Zealand in what is regarded as its national sport. The All Blacks are the Rugby World Cup champions, the IRB's current Team of the Year, the leading points scorers of all time and the only international rugby team with a record winning margin against every test nation they have played. The All Blacks have held the top ranking in the world for longer than all other countries combined and in over 100 years only five test rugby nations have ever beaten New Zealand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/All_Blacks_logo.svg/220px-All_Blacks_logo.svg.png
