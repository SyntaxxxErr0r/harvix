The top eight countries consume about 4.7 million horses a year. For the majority of mankind's early existence, wild horses were hunted as a source of protein. It is slightly sweet, tender, low in fat and high in protein.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Basashi.jpg/150px-Basashi.jpg
