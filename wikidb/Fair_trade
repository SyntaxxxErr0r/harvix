308.5	Fair_trade	Fair trade	Fair trade is an organized social movement and market-based approach that aims to help producers in developing countries to make better trading conditions and promote sustainability. The movement advocates the payment of a higher price to exporters as well as higher social and environmental standards. It focuses in particular on exports from developing countries to developed countries, most notably handicrafts, coffee, cocoa, sugar, tea, bananas, honey, cotton, wine, fresh fruit, chocolate, flowers, and gold. Fair trade is also associated with the trade justice movement, which advocates for Fair Trade public policies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Coffee_beans_being_sorted_and_pulped.jpg/220px-Coffee_beans_being_sorted_and_pulped.jpg
