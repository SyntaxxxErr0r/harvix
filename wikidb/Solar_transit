4.10	Solar_transit	Solar transit	In astronomy, a solar transit is when any object passes between the Sun and the Earth. This mainly includes the planets Mercury and Venus. A solar eclipse is also a solar transit of the Moon, but technically only if it does not cover the entire disc of the Sun (an annular eclipse), as "transit" counts only objects that are smaller than what they are passing in front of. Solar transit is only one of several types of astronomical transit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Atlantis_silhouette.jpg/300px-Atlantis_silhouette.jpg
