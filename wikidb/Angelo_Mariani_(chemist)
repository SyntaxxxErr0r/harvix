8.00	Angelo_Mariani_(chemist)	Angelo Mariani (chemist)	Angelo Mariani or Ange-Fran√ßois Mariani (1838 Pero-Casevecchie, Haute-Corse - 1914) was a French chemist, originally from the island of Corsica. He is best known as the inventor of the first cocawine, Vin Mariani, in 1863. His contribution was to introduce the coca leaf indirectly to the general public. Mariani imported tons of coca leaves and used an extract from them in many products. It was Mariani's coca wine, though, that made him rich and famous. Mariani was also awarded with a medal of appreciation from Pope Leo XIII. This tonic wine is deemed as the Coca Cola ancestor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Vin_mariani_publicite156.jpg/180px-Vin_mariani_publicite156.jpg
