Erhard, offered a two-weekend (60-hour) course known officially as "The est Standard Training". The purpose of est was "to transform one's ability to experience living so that the situations one had been trying to change or had been putting up with, clear up just in the process of life itself." The est training was offered from late 1971 to late 1984.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Werner_Erhard_in_1977.jpg
