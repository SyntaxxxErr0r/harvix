77.7	Pandora	Pandora	In Greek mythology, Pandora , in modern accounts sometimes mistranslated as "Pandora's box" (see below), releasing all the evils of mankind — although the particular evils, aside from plagues and diseases, are not specified in detail by Hesiod — leaving only Hope inside once she had closed it again. She opened the jar out of simple curiosity and not as a malicious act.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Pandora_Loison_cour_Carree_Louvre.jpg/170px-Pandora_Loison_cour_Carree_Louvre.jpg
