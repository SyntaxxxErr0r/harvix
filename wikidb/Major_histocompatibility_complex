57.7	Major_histocompatibility_complex	Major histocompatibility complex	Classical MHC molecules present epitopes to the TCRs of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Nonclassical molecules (MHC class IB) exhibit limited polymorphism, expression patterns, and presented antigens; this group is subdivided into a group encoded within MHC loci (e.g., HLA-E, -F, -G) as well as those not (e.g., stress ligands such as ULBPs, Rae1, H60); the antigen/ligand for many of these molecules remain unknown, but they can interact with both CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/MHC_Class_1.svg/200px-MHC_Class_1.svg.png
