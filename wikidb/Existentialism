171.7	Existentialism	Existentialism	Existentialism is the philosophy that holds that philosophical thinking begins with the human subjectâ€”not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual. In existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. Many existentialists have regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience. Existentialism is characterized by its proponents having profound doctrinal differences relative to other philosophies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Kierkegaard.jpg/150px-Kierkegaard.jpg
