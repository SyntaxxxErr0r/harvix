242.3	Music	Music	Music is an art form whose medium is sound and silence. Its common elements are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Music_lesson_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_2421.jpg/250px-Music_lesson_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_2421.jpg
