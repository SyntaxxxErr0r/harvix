According to Wiig, the kidnappers were convinced that Centanni worked for the CIA, in part because of his presence as a journalist at the deaths of Uday and Qusay Hussein in Iraq, and that they intended to kill him. Nevertheless, they also repeatedly promised both men they would soon be freed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1c/Wiggcentaniinterview.JPG
