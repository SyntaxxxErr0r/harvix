276.6	Vuvuzela	Vuvuzela	The vuvuzela , also known as lepatata Mambu (its Tswana name), is a plastic horn, about 65 centimetres (2 ft) long, which produces a loud monotone note, typically around B3 (the B below middle C). Some models are made in two parts to facilitate storage, and this design also allows pitch variation. Many types of vuvuzela, made by several manufacturers, may produce various intensity and frequency outputs. The intensity of these outputs depends on the blowing technique and pressure exerted.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Vuvuzela_red.jpg/250px-Vuvuzela_red.jpg
