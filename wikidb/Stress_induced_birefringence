1.00	Stress_induced_birefringence	Photoelasticity	Photoelasticity is an experimental method to determine the stress distribution in a material. The method is mostly used in cases where mathematical methods become quite cumbersome. Unlike the analytical methods of stress determination, photoelasticity gives a fairly accurate picture of stress distribution even around abrupt discontinuities in a material. The method serves as an important tool for determining the critical stress points in a material and is often used for determining stress concentration factors in irregular geometries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/BiodegradablePlasticUtensils2.jpg/300px-BiodegradablePlasticUtensils2.jpg
