7.23	Coq_Roq	Coq Roq	Coq Roq, also typeset as COQ ROQ, and pronounced "Cock Rock", was an advertising program created in late 2004 to promote international fast food restaurant chain Burger King's chicken product, BK Chicken Fries. Created by the Miami-based advertising firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky (abbreviated to CP+B), the program featured a viral marketing website, television and print campaigns and a fictional MySpace page. The program was similar to other marketing campaigns created by CP+B for Burger King, including the Subservient Chicken, Ugoff, and Sith Sense.
