85.1	GPGPU	GPGPU	GPUs can only process independent vertices and fragments, but can process many of them in parallel. This is especially effective when the programmer wants to process many vertices or fragments in the same way. In this sense, GPUs are stream processors â€“ processors that can operate in parallel by running one kernel on many records in a stream at once.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/AmdahlsLaw.svg/200px-AmdahlsLaw.svg.png
