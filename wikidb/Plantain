94.4	Plantain	Plantain	Plantain is the common name for herbaceous plants of the genus Musa. The fruit they produce is generally used for cooking, in contrast to the soft, sweet banana (which is sometimes referred to as the dessert banana). There is no formal botanical distinction between bananas and plantains, and the use of either term is based purely on how the fruits are consumed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Plantains.jpg/240px-Plantains.jpg
