1.00	Rabbit_agility	Rabbit show jumping	Rabbit show jumping (sometimes known as rabbit dressage or rabbit hopping) is a competition in which trained domestic rabbits leap over appropriately sized obstacles. The activity began in the late 1970s in Sweden (where it is known as Kaninhoppning). It was popularized in the United Kingdom following an appearance on the TV show That's Life!. There are more than fifty rabbit show jumping clubs throughout Scandinavia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Kaninhoppning-king_of_joyride.jpg/200px-Kaninhoppning-king_of_joyride.jpg
