4.40	Seacoast_Defense_(US)	Seacoast defense in the United States	Seacoast defense was a major concern for the United States from its independence until World War II. Before airplanes, America's enemies could only reach her from the sea, making coastal forts an economical alternative to standing armies or a large navy. After the 1940s it was recognized that fixed fortifications were obsolete and ineffective against aircraft and missiles. However, in prior eras foreign fleets were a realistic threat, and substantial fortifications were built at key locations, especially protecting major harbors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Fort_mc_henry_cannon_Baltimore.jpg/250px-Fort_mc_henry_cannon_Baltimore.jpg
