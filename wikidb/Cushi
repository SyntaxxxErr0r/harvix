2.00	Cushi	Cushi	Initially in Modern Israeli Hebrew, the term "Cushi" was not used as a pejorative term. At times, it was even used to refer fondly to a person of dark skin or a red haired person, as King David was red headed: was of ruddy complexion and his face which was on his head was ruddy not his hair as is written in Book of Samuel; and as per wisdom of Tree of Life the sephiroth Keter is connected to head which does not discriminate between hair and face; so if somebody writes his head was red means his face was ruddy(his face like other faces was included in his head and it was his face which was ruddy or red like). Other words were used to describe dark skin as a pejorative term, for example, the word "Schwartz" (Yiddish: ), taken from its similar meaning in the Yiddish language â€“- black. In the last decades of the 20th century, the word "Cushi" became a racist slur, some claim as a result of the identification of its terms in English, "Nigger" and "Negro". However, this scenario has never been proven.
