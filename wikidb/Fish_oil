Fish oils contain the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), precursors of certain eicosanoids that are known to reduce inflammation throughout the body, and are thought to have many health benefits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/Fish_oil_softgel.jpg/100px-Fish_oil_softgel.jpg
