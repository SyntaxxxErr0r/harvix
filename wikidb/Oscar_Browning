8.40	Oscar_Browning	Oscar Browning	Oscar Browning (17 January 1837 â€“ 6 October 1923) was an English writer, historian, and educational reformer. His greatest achievement was the cofounding, along with Henry Sidgwick, of the Cambridge University Day Training College in 1891. This was one of the earliest institutions in Great Britain to focus on the training of educators, preempted only by the founding of the Cambridge Teaching College for Women by Elizabeth Hughes in 1885.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Oscar_browning.jpg/220px-Oscar_browning.jpg
