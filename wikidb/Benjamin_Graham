63.7	Benjamin_Graham	Benjamin Graham	Benjamin Graham (May 8, 1894 â€“ September 21, 1976) was a British-born American economist and professional investor. Graham is considered the first proponent of value investing, an investment approach he began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 and subsequently refined with David Dodd through various editions of their famous book Security Analysis. Graham's followers include Warren Buffett, William J. Ruane, Irving Kahn, Hani Anklis, Walter J. Schloss, Chris Johnston and others. Buffett, who credits Graham as grounding him with a sound intellectual investment framework, described him as the second most influential person in his life after his own father. In fact, Graham had such an overwhelming influence on his students that two of them, Buffett and Kahn, named their sons, Howard Graham Buffett and Thomas Graham Kahn, after him.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Benjamin_Graham.jpg
