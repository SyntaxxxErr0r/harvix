10.41	East_Australian_Current	East Australian Current	The East Australian Current (EAC) is an ocean current that moves warm water from the tropical Coral Sea, where it splits from the South Equatorial Current, down the east coast of Australia. It is the largest ocean current close to the shores of Australia. It can reach speeds of up to seven knots in some of the shallower waters along the Australian continental shelf, but is generally measured at two to three knots. The EAC results in a current vortex in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. The EAC also acts to transport tropical marine fauna to habitats in sub-tropical regions along the south east Australian coast.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/East_Australian_Current.jpg/350px-East_Australian_Current.jpg
