Encyclicals (from Latin encyclia, from the Greek "en kyklo, ", meaning "general" or "encircling") were originally circular letters sent to all the churches of a particular area in the early Christian church. For the modern Roman Catholic Church, a papal encyclical, in the strictest sense, is a letter sent by the Pope which is explicitly addressed to Roman Catholic bishops of a particular area or to the world, usually treating some aspect of Catholic doctrine. A papal encyclical is generally used for significant issues, and is second in importance only to the highest ranking document now issued by popes, an Apostolic Constitution. The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its first few words. Pope John Paul II issued his first encyclical, Redemptor Hominis, on 4 March 1979. Ecclesia de Eucharistia, his last encyclical, was issued on 17 April 2003.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/JohannesPaul2-portrait.jpg
