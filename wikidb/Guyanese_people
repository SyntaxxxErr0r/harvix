2.21	Guyanese_people	Guyanese people	Guyanese people are people originating in the South American nation of Guyana. Geographically Guyana is not an island in the Caribbean but a nearby mainland land mass associated with the English Caribbean through history and culture first as a Dutch, then British colony, and as a founding member of CARICOM. The culture of Guyana is described as Caribbean or "West Indian", as it is much more similar to the culture of the "West Indian" Caribbean islands such as Trinidad, Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenada, rather than the other South American countries. Like other Caribbean countries Guyanese culture shares some customs and traits with other Latin American countries.
