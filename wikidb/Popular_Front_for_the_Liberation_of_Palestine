70.1	Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine	Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine	The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (Arabic: الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين, al-Jabhah al-Sha`biyyah li-Taḥrīr Filasṭīn) is a Palestinian Marxist-Leninist organisation founded in 1967. It has consistently been the second-largest of the groups forming the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the largest being Fatah. Currently the PFLP is boycotting participation in the Executive Committee of the PLO. It considers both the Fatah-led government in the West Bank and the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip as illegal due to the lack of new elections to the Palestinian National Authority since 2006.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/PFLP_flag_smoothed.svg/150px-PFLP_flag_smoothed.svg.png
