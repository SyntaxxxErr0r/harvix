Kuwait was ranked 63rd on the Human Development Index ( HDI) report for 2011 by UNDP, placing Kuwait above the regional average. The education system in Kuwait has celebrated several achievements; in the year ending 2006, thirteen percent of all public expenditure was given to education, comparable to many OECD countries, although lower than other Arab nations. As a percentage of GDP, at 3.9 percent, it remains well below the OECD average.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Kuwait-CIA_WFB_Map.png
