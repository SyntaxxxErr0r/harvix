With the series of Beginner Books that The Cat inaugurated, Seuss promoted both his name and the cause of elementary literacy in the United States of America. The eponymous cat appears in six of Seuss's rhymed children's books:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b5/Seuss-cat-hat.gif/200px-Seuss-cat-hat.gif
