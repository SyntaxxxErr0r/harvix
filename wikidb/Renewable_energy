205.0	Renewable_energy	Renewable energy	Renewable energy is energy which comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat, which are renewable (naturally replenished). About 16% of global final energy consumption comes from renewables, with 10% coming from traditional biomass, which is mainly used for heating, and 3.4% from hydroelectricity. New renewables (small hydro, modern biomass, wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels) accounted for another 3% and are growing very rapidly. The share of renewables in electricity generation is around 19%, with 16% of global electricity coming from hydroelectricity and 3% from new renewables.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Pretty_flamingos_-_geograph.org.uk_-_578705.jpg/220px-Pretty_flamingos_-_geograph.org.uk_-_578705.jpg
