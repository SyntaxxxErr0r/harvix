62.2	Neon_Genesis_Evangelion	Neon Genesis Evangelion	Neon Genesis Evangelion Shin Seiki Evangerion) is a Japanese media franchise created and owned by Gainax. Most of the franchise feature an apocalyptic mecha action story, which revolves around the efforts by the paramilitary organization NERV to fight hostile beings called Angels, using giant humanoids called Evangelions that are piloted by select teenagers (of whom Shinji Ikari is the primary protagonist). Other works deviate from this theme to varying degrees, focusing more on romantic interactions between the characters, side stories which did not appear in the original works, and/or reimaginings of the conflicts from the original works. The franchise began in 1995 with the titular anime directed by Hideaki Anno and has since grossed over 150 billion yen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/NGEscreenshot02.jpg/220px-NGEscreenshot02.jpg
