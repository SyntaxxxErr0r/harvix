Roger Muir and telecast on NBC in the United States from 1947 until 1960. It was a pioneer in children's television programming and set the pattern for many similar shows. One of the first television series produced at NBC in Rockefeller Center, in Studio 3A, it was also a pioneer in early color production as NBC (at the time owned by TV maker RCA) used the show in part to sell color television sets in the 1950s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Buffalo_Bob_Smith_and_Howdy_Doody.jpg/200px-Buffalo_Bob_Smith_and_Howdy_Doody.jpg
