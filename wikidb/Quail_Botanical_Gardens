4.20	Quail_Botanical_Gardens	San Diego Botanic Garden	The San Diego Botanic Garden, formerly Quail Botanical Gardens, is a botanical garden in Encinitas, California, USA. At 37 acres (150,000 m2), the garden includes rare bamboo groves (said to be the largest bamboo collection in the United States), desert gardens, a tropical rainforest, California native plants, Mediterranean climate landscapes, and a subtropical fruit garden. The gardens are open to the public daily. The name of the facility was changed in 2009 to better reflect the garden's status as a regional attraction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Quail_Botanical_Gardens_-_general_view.JPG/250px-Quail_Botanical_Gardens_-_general_view.JPG
