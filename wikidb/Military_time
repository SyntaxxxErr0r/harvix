13.20	Military_time	24-hour clock	The 24-hour clock is a convention of time keeping in which the day runs from midnight to midnight and is divided into 24 hours, indicated by the hours passed since midnight, from 0 to 23. This system is the most commonly used time notation in the world today. The 12-hour clock is, however, still dominant in a handful of countries, and is still used in official situations, and for things such as timetables and TV schedules, in Australia, Canada (except Quebec), the Philippines, the United States, and Colombia. The 24-hour notation is popularly referred to as military time or astronomical time in the United States and Canada. It is also the international standard notation of time . In the practice of medicine, the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient's medical history.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bd/Railtime.jpg/450px-Railtime.jpg
