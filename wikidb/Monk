81.0	Monk	Monk	A monk (from Greek: , monachos, "single, solitary") is a person who practices religious asceticism, living either alone or with any number of other monks, while always maintaining some degree of physical separation from those not sharing the same purpose. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/StAnthony.jpg
