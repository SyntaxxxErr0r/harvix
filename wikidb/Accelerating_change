53.1	Accelerating_change	Accelerating change	Since the late 1970s, others like Alvin Toffler (author of Future Shock), Daniel Bell and John Naisbitt have approached theories of postindustrial societies. They argue the industrial era is coming to an end, and services and information are supplanting industry and goods. Some more extreme visions of the postindustrial society, especially in fiction, envision the elimination of economic scarcity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/PPTMASSuseInventionsLogPRINT.jpg/200px-PPTMASSuseInventionsLogPRINT.jpg
