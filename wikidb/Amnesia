66.0	Amnesia	Amnesia	Amnesia (from Greek ) is a condition in which one's memory is lost. The causes of amnesia have traditionally been divided into categories. Memory appears to be stored in several parts of the limbic system of the brain, and any condition that interferes with the function of this system can cause amnesia. Functional causes are psychological factors, such as mental disorder, post-traumatic stress or, in psychoanalytic terms, defence mechanisms. Amnesia may also appear as spontaneous episodes, in the case of transient global amnesia.
