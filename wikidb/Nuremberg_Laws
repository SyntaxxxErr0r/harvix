53.6	Nuremberg_Laws	Nuremberg Laws	The Nuremberg Laws (German: ) of 1935 were antisemitic laws in Nazi Germany introduced at the annual Nuremberg Rally of the Nazi Party. After the takeover of power in 1933 by Hitler, Nazism became an official ideology incorporating antisemitism as a form of scientific racism. There was a rapid growth in German legislation directed at Jews, such as the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which banned "non-Aryans" from the civil-service.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/RGBL_I_1935_S_1145.jpg/250px-RGBL_I_1935_S_1145.jpg
