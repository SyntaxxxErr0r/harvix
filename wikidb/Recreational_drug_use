62.9	Recreational_drug_use	Recreational drug use	The concept of "responsible drug use" is that a person can use recreational drugs with reduced or eliminated risk of negatively affecting other aspects of one's life or other people's lives. In general, this takes place at a party or party-like event. Advocates of this philosophy point to the many well-known artists and intellectuals who have used drugs, experimentally or otherwise, with few detrimental effects on their lives. Critics argue that the drugs are escapist â€” and dangerous, unpredictable and sometimes addictive, and have negative and profound effects in geographic areas well beyond the location of the user. These criticisms can apply to a number of non-drug-related addictions and behavioral abuse disorders. Responsible drug use becomes drug abuse only when the use of the substance significantly interferes with the user's daily life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Marijuana.jpg/120px-Marijuana.jpg
