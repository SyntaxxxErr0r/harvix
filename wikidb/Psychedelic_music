51.3	Psychedelic_music	Psychedelic music	Psychedelic music (sometimes psychedelia derived from the Ancient Greek word: ψυχή "psyche", mind; soul; breath; spirit) covers a range of popular music styles and genres, which are inspired by or influenced by psychedelic culture and which attempt to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs. It emerged during the mid 1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United States and Britain. It often used new recording techniques and effects and drew on non-Western sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music. It spread into psychedelic folk, psychedelic rock, psychedelic pop and psychedelic soul in the 1960s before declining in the early 1970s. It helped create many new musical genres including progressive rock, kosmische musik, synth rock, jazz rock, heavy metal, glam rock, funk, electro and bubblegum pop. It was revived in forms of neopsychedelia from the 1980s and re-emerged in electronic music in genres including acid house, trance music (see psychedelic trance) and new rave.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/SantanaAbraxas.jpg/220px-SantanaAbraxas.jpg
