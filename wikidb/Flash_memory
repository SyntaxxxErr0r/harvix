156.9	Flash_memory	Flash memory	Flash memory is a non-volatile computer storage chip that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. It was developed from EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) and must be erased in fairly large blocks before these can be rewritten with new data. The high density NAND type must also be programmed and read in (smaller) blocks, or pages, while the NOR type allows a single machine word (byte) to be written or read independently.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/USB_flash_drive.JPG/220px-USB_flash_drive.JPG
