10.02	Swashbuckling	Swashbuckler	Swashbuckler or swasher is a term that emerged in the 16th century and has been used for rough, noisy and boastful swordsmen ever since. A possible explanation for this term is that it derives from a fighting style using a side-sword with a buckler in the off-hand, which was applied with much "swashing and making a noise on the buckler". Later the name "swashbuckler" (like Gunslinger) became common for an archetype and the accordant special film genre.In Italy the genre was known as Cappa e spada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg/220px-Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg
