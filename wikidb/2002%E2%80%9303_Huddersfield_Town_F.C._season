1.00	2002%E2%80%9303_Huddersfield_Town_F.C._season	2002â€“03 Huddersfield Town F.C. season	Huddersfield Town's 2002-03 campaign saw them relegated to the bottom division for the first time since the 1979-80 season. Huddersfield endured a dreadful season under Mick Wadsworth. That season saw Wadsworth sacked twice, but on the first attempt of him being sacked, he was re-hired because the club couldn't pay him off. Mel Machin took over for the last month of the season, but couldn't stop the Terriers relegating to the Football League Third Division. Town's main worry during the season was administration, which nearly saw the club liquidated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Kit_shorts_adidasonwhite.png
