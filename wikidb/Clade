76.9	Clade	Clade	A cladenote 1 is a group consisting of a species and all its descendants. In the terms of biological systematics, a clade is a single "branch" on the "tree of life". The idea that such a "natural group" of organisms should be grouped together and given a taxonomic name is central to biological classification. In cladistics (which takes its name from the term), clades are the only acceptable units.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Clade-grade_II.svg/334px-Clade-grade_II.svg.png
