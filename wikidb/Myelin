72.7	Myelin	Myelin	Myelin is a dielectric material that forms a layer, the myelin sheath, usually around only the axon of a neuron. It is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Myelin is an outgrowth of a type of glial cell. The production of the myelin sheath is called myelination. In humans, the production of myelin begins in the fourteenth week of fetal development, although little myelin exists in the brain at the time of birth. During infancy, myelination occurs quickly and continues through the adolescent stages of life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg/400px-Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg.png
