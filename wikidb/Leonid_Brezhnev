51.6	Leonid_Brezhnev	Leonid Brezhnev	Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev ; Ukrainian: , 19 December 1906 (O.S. 6 December) â€“ 10 November 1982) was the General Secretary of the Central Committee (CC) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), presiding over the country from 1964 until his death in 1982. His eighteen-year term as General Secretary was second only to that of Joseph Stalin in length. During Brezhnev's rule, the global influence of the Soviet Union grew dramatically, in part because of the expansion of the Soviet military during this time, but his tenure as leader has often been criticised for marking the beginning of a period of economic stagnation, overlooking serious economic problems which eventually led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Brezhnev-color.jpg/220px-Brezhnev-color.jpg
