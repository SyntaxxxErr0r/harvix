86.7	Mercantilism	Mercantilism	Mercantilism is the economic doctrine in which government control of foreign trade is of paramount importance for ensuring the prosperity and military security of the state. In particular, it demands a positive balance of trade. Mercantilism dominated Western European economic policy and discourse from the 16th to late-18th centuries. Mercantilism was a cause of frequent European wars in that time and motivated colonial expansion. Mercantilist theory varied in sophistication from one writer to another and evolved over time. Favors for powerful interests were often defended with mercantilist reasoning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Lorrain.seaport.jpg/300px-Lorrain.seaport.jpg
