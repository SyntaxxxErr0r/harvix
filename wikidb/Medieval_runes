Due to the expansion, each rune corresponded to only one phoneme, whereas the runes in the preceding Younger Futhark could correspond to several.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Saleby_kyrkklocka%2C_V%C3%A4sterg%C3%B6tland.png/220px-Saleby_kyrkklocka%2C_V%C3%A4sterg%C3%B6tland.png
