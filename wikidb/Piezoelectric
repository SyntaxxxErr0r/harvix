65.8	Piezoelectric	Piezoelectricity	The Curies, however, did not predict the converse piezoelectric effect. The converse effect was mathematically deduced from fundamental thermodynamic principles by Gabriel Lippmann in 1881. The Curies immediately confirmed the existence of the converse effect, and went on to obtain quantitative proof of the complete reversibility of electro-elasto-mechanical deformations in piezoelectric crystals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/SchemaPiezo.gif/220px-SchemaPiezo.gif
