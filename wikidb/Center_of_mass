55.1	Center_of_mass	Center of mass	In physics, the center of mass or barycenter of a body is a point in space where, for the purpose of various calculations, the entire mass of a body may be assumed to be concentrated. (In reality none of the object's mass may be at this point as for instance in a hoop or an empty box.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Bird_toy_showing_center_of_gravity.jpg/220px-Bird_toy_showing_center_of_gravity.jpg
