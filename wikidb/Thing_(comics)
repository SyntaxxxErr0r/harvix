72.6	Thing_(comics)	Thing (comics)	The Thing is a fictional character, a superhero, and a founding member of the Fantastic Four in the Marvel Universe. He was created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee and made his first appearance in The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961). His trademark orange rocky appearance, sense of humor, blue eyes, and his famous battle cry, "It's clobberin' time!" makes him one of the most recognizable and popular comic book characters. The Thing's speech patterns are loosely based on those of Jimmy Durante.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a3/Thing_v2_1_coverart.jpg/250px-Thing_v2_1_coverart.jpg
