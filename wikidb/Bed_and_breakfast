60.5	Bed_and_breakfast	Bed and breakfast	A bed and breakfast (or B&amp;B) is a small lodging establishment that offers overnight accommodation and breakfast, but usually does not offer other meals. Since the 1980s, the meaning of the term has also extended to include accommodations that are also known as "self-catering" establishments. Typically, bed and breakfasts are private homes with fewer than 10 bedrooms available for commercial use.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/27/Day173abfastg.JPG/300px-Day173abfastg.JPG
