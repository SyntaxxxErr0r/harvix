2.00	Le_Suquet_Cannes	Le Suquet	Le Suquet is the old quarter of Cannes, probably best known to tourists as the climbing, winding cobbled lane lined with local restaurants, Rue St Antoine. Le Suquet contains a clock tower and church that sit highfacing east overlooking the Bay of Cannes and Cannes itself. At the bottom of Le Suquet on Rue Dr. P. Gayagnaire is the Marche Forville, where the market is held in the mornings and early afternoon.
