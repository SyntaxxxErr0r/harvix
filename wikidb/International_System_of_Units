95.4	International_System_of_Units	International System of Units	The International System of Units (abbreviated SI from French: ) is the modern form of the metric system and is generally a system of units of measurement devised around seven base units and the convenience of the number ten. The older metric system included several groups of units. The SI was established in 1960, based on the metre-kilogram-second system, rather than the centimetre-gram-second system, which, in turn, had a few variants. The SI is declared as an evolving system, thus prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses, and as the precision of measurements improves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2b/SI_Brochure_Cover.jpg
