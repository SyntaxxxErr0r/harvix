107.9	Weather	Weather	Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, "weather" is understood to be the weather of Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Thunder_lightning_Garajau_Madeira_289985700.jpg/250px-Thunder_lightning_Garajau_Madeira_289985700.jpg
