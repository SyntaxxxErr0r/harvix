2.00	2005%E2%80%9306_Niger_food_crisis	2005–2006 Niger food crisis	A severe but localized food security crisis occurred in the regions of northern Maradi, Tahoua, Tillabéri, and Zinder of Niger from 2005 to 2006. It was caused by an early end to the 2004 rains, desert locust damage to some pasture lands, high food prices, and chronic poverty. In the affected area, 2.4 million of 3.6 million people are considered highly vulnerable to food insecurity. An international assessment stated that, of these, over 800,000 face extreme food insecurity and another 800,000 in moderately insecure food situations are in need of aid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/86/Famine_Niger.jpg/300px-Famine_Niger.jpg
