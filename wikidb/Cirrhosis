74.6	Cirrhosis	Cirrhosis	Cirrhosis ( ) is a consequence of chronic liver disease characterized by replacement of liver tissue by fibrosis, scar tissue and regenerative nodules (lumps that occur as a result of a process in which damaged tissue is regenerated), leading to loss of liver function. Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcoholism, hepatitis B and C, and fatty liver disease, but has many other possible causes. Some cases are idiopathic, i.e., of unknown cause.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Hepaticfailure.jpg/230px-Hepaticfailure.jpg
