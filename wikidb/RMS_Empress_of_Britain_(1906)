4.10	RMS_Empress_of_Britain_(1906)	RMS Empress of Britain (1906)	RMS Empress of Britain was a transatlantic ocean liner built by Fairfield Shipbuilding at Govan on the Clyde in Scotland in 1905-1906 for Canadian Pacific Steamship (CP). This ship -- the first of three CP vessels to be named Empress of Britain -- regularly traversed the trans-Atlantic route between Canada and Europe until 1922, with the exception of the war years. This Empress was distinguished by the Royal Mail Ship (RMS) prefix in front of her name because the British government and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) had decades earlier reached agreement on a contract for subsidized mail service between Britain and Hong Kong via Canada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/SS_Empress_of_Britain_pre-1924.jpg/300px-SS_Empress_of_Britain_pre-1924.jpg
