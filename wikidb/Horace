74.1	Horace	Horace	Quintus Horatius Flaccus (8 December 65 BC â€“ 27 November 8 BC), known in the English-speaking world as Horace, was the leading Roman lyric poet during the time of Augustus. The rhetorician Quintillian regarded his Odes as almost the only Latin lyrics worth reading, justifying his estimate with the words: "He can be lofty sometimes, yet he is also full of charm and grace, versatile in his figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words."nb 1	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Quintus_Horatius_Flaccus.jpg/200px-Quintus_Horatius_Flaccus.jpg
