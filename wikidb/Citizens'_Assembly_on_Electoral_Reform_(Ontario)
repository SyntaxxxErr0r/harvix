Modelled on the British Columbia equivalent, it reviewed the first past the post electoral system currently in use to elect members of the Ontario Legislature, with the authority to recommend an alternative. In May 2007, the Assembly decided to recommend, by a decision of 94-8, that Ontario adopt a form of mixed member proportional representation (MMP).
