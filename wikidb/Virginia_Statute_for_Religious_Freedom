51.0	Virginia_Statute_for_Religious_Freedom	Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom	The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was drafted in 1777 (though it was not first introduced into the Virginia General Assembly until 1779) by Thomas Jefferson in the city of Fredericksburg, Virginia. In 1786, the Assembly enacted the statute into the state's law. The Statute for Religious Freedom is one of only three accomplishments Jefferson instructed be put in his epitaph. It supported the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and freedom of conscience.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Thomas_Jefferson%27s_Grave_Site.jpg/220px-Thomas_Jefferson%27s_Grave_Site.jpg
