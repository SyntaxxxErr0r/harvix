1.00	Declan_MacManus	Elvis Costello	Elvis Costello (born Declan Patrick MacManus, 25 August 1954) is an English singer-songwriter. He came to prominence as an early participant in London's pub rock scene in the mid-1970s and later became associated with the punk/New Wave genre. Steeped in word play, the vocabulary of Costello's lyrics is broader than that of most popular songs. His music has drawn on many diverse genres; one critic described him as a "pop encyclopedia", able to "reinvent the past in his own image".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/ElvisCostello09TIFF.jpg/210px-ElvisCostello09TIFF.jpg
