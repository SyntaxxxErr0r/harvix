70.4	Feather	Feather	Feathers are one of the epidermal growths that form the distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on birds and some non-avian theropod dinosaurs. They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates, and indeed a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty. They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant Aves from other living groups. Feathers have also been noticed in those Theropoda which have been termed feathered dinosaurs. Although feathers cover most parts of the body of birds, they arise only from certain well-defined tracts on the skin. They aid in flight, thermal insulation, waterproofing and coloration that helps in communication and protection.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Types_de_plumes._-_Larousse_pour_tous%2C_-1907-1910-.jpg/220px-Types_de_plumes._-_Larousse_pour_tous%2C_-1907-1910-.jpg
