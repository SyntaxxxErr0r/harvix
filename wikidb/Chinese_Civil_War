79.3	Chinese_Civil_War	Chinese Civil War	The Chinese Civil War (1927–1950) was a civil war fought between the Kuomintang (KMT or the Chinese Nationalist Party), the governing party of the Republic of China, and the Communist Party of China (CPC) (also known as CCP – Chinese Communist Party), for the control of China which eventually led to China's division into two Chinas, Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan and People's Republic of China (PRC) in Mainland. The war began in April 1927, amidst the Northern Expedition, and essentially ended when major active battles ceased in 1949–1950. However there is debate on whether the war has officially ended. The conflict continues in the form of military threats and political and economic pressure, particularly over the political status of Taiwan. The continued tension is described in cross-Strait relations. The Chinese Civil War is the third largest war ever fought in history, behind World War I and World World II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Shangtang.jpg/260px-Shangtang.jpg
