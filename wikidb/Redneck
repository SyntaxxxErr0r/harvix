57.4	Redneck	Redneck	Redneck is a historically derogatory slang term used in reference to poor, uneducated white farmers, especially from the southern United States. It is similar in meaning to cracker (especially regarding Georgia and Florida), hillbilly (especially regarding Appalachia and the Ozarks), and white trash (but without the last term's suggestions of immorality).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Larry_the_Cable_Guy.jpg/220px-Larry_the_Cable_Guy.jpg
