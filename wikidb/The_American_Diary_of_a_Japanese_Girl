2.00	The_American_Diary_of_a_Japanese_Girl	The American Diary of a Japanese Girl	The American Diary of a Japanese Girl is the first English novel published in the United States by a person of Japanese ancestry. Acquired for Frank Leslie's Illustrated Monthly Magazine by editor Ellery Sedgwick in 1901, it appeared in two excerpted installments in November and December of that year with illustrations by Genjiro Yeto. In 1902, it was published in book form by the New York firm of Frederick A. Stokes. Marketed as (and believed, with some doubts, to be) an authentic diary by an 18-year-old visitor to the United States named "Miss Morning Glory" (Asagao), it was in actuality the work of Yone Noguchi, who wrote it with the editorial assistance of Blanche Partington and LÃ©onie Gilmour.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Noguchi-Diary-Stokes.jpg/200px-Noguchi-Diary-Stokes.jpg
