1.00	Chevaux-De-Frise	Cheval de frise	The cheval de frise (plural: chevaux de frise) was a Medieval defensive obstacle consisting of a portable frame (sometimes just a simple log) covered with many long iron or wooden spikes or even actual spears. They were principally intended as an anti-cavalry obstacle but could also be moved quickly to help block a breach in another barrier. They remained in occasional use until they were replaced by wire obstacles just after the American Civil War. During the Civil War, it was most often used by the Confederates. However, during World War I, chevaux de frise were used to temporarily plug gaps in barbed wire. Chevaux de frise of barbed wire were used in jungle fighting on south Pacific islands during World War II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Cheval_de_frise_petersburg_civil_war_02598.jpg/220px-Cheval_de_frise_petersburg_civil_war_02598.jpg
