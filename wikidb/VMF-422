1.00	VMF-422	VMF-422	Marine Fighting Squadron 422 (VMF-422) was an F4U Corsair squadron in the United States Marine Corps. The squadron, also known as the “Flying Buccaneers”, fought in World War II but is perhaps best known for its role in the worst accident in naval aviation history when they lost 22 of 23 aircraft flying through a storm on January 25, 1944.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/VMF-422.JPG/200px-VMF-422.JPG
