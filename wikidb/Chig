1.00	Chig	Chigs	The series provides little concrete evidence about the Chigs until the last two episodes, choosing to initially present the Chigs as a traditional science-fiction alien enemy out to destroy humanity. Throughout the series, the writers provide several small clues regarding the nature of the Chigs, their motivations, and their biology before devoting the last two episodes of the series to revealing the possibility that Chigs and humans are related species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4d/Space-_Above_and_Beyond_-_Chig_%282%29.jpg/220px-Space-_Above_and_Beyond_-_Chig_%282%29.jpg
