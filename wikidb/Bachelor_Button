3.00	Bachelor_Button	Cornflower	Centaurea cyanus ('Cornflower, Bachelors button, Bluebottle, Boutonniere flower, Hurtsickle, Cyani flower) is a small annual flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to Europe. "Cornflower" is also erroneously used for chicory, and more correctly for a few other Centaurea species; to distinguish C. cyanus from these it is sometimes called Common Cornflower. It may also be referred to as basketflower, though the term properly refers to the Plectocephalus group of Centaurea, which is probably a distinct genus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/CentaureaCyanus-bloem-kl.jpg/220px-CentaureaCyanus-bloem-kl.jpg
