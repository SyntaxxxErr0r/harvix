6.11	Aircraft_cabin	Aircraft cabin	An aircraft cabin is the section of an aircraft in which passengers travel. At cruising altitudes of modern commercial aircraft the surrounding atmosphere is too thin to breathe without an oxygen mask, so cabins are pressurized at a higher pressure than ambient pressure at altitude.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Lufthansa_737_interior.jpg/220px-Lufthansa_737_interior.jpg
