130.4	Integer	Integer	The integers (from the Latin integer, literally "untouched", hence "whole": the word entire comes from the same origin, but via French) are formed by the natural numbers (including 0) (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) together with the negatives of the non-zero natural numbers (−1, −2, −3, ...). Viewed as a subset of the real numbers, they are numbers that can be written without a fractional or decimal component, and fall within the set {..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...}. For example, 21, 4, and −2048 are integers; 9.75, 5½, and 14% are not integers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Latex_integers.svg/100px-Latex_integers.svg.png
