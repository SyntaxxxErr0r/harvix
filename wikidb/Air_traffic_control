66.0	Air_traffic_control	Air traffic control	Air traffic control is a service provided by ground-based controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and in the air. The primary purpose of ATC systems worldwide is to separate aircraft to prevent collisions, to organize and expedite the flow of traffic, and to provide information and other support for pilots when able. In some countries, ATC may also play a security or defense role, or be run entirely by the military.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Verkeerstorens_Schiphol.jpg/220px-Verkeerstorens_Schiphol.jpg
