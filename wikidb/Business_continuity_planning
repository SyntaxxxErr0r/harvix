66.4	Business_continuity_planning	Business continuity planning	Business continuity planning “identifies organization's exposure to internal and external threats and synthesizes hard and soft assets to provide effective prevention and recovery for the organization, whilst maintaining competitive advantage and value system integrity”. It is also called business continuity and resiliency planning (BCRP). A business continuity plan is a roadmap for continuing operations under adverse conditions (i.e. interruption from natural or man-made hazards). BCP is an ongoing state or methodology governing how business is conducted. In the US, governmental entities refer to the process as continuity of operations planning (COOP).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/BCPLifecycle.gif/220px-BCPLifecycle.gif
