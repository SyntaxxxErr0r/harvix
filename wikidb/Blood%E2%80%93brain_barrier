4.10	Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier	Blood–brain barrier	The blood–brain barrier is a separation of circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid (BECF) in the central nervous system (CNS). It occurs along all capillaries and consists of tight junctions around the capillaries that do not exist in normal circulation. Endothelial cells restrict the diffusion of microscopic objects (e.g. bacteria) and large or hydrophilic molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while allowing the diffusion of small hydrophobic molecules (O2, CO2, hormones). Cells of the barrier actively transport metabolic products such as glucose across the barrier with specific proteins. This barrier also includes a thick basement membrane and astrocytic endfeet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/10.1371_journal.pbio.0050169.g001-O.jpg/250px-10.1371_journal.pbio.0050169.g001-O.jpg
