93.9	Digital_Living_Network_Alliance	Digital Living Network Alliance	The Digital Living Network Alliance is a non-profit collaborative trade organization established by Sony in June 2003, that is responsible for defining interoperability guidelines to enable sharing of digital media between consumer devices such as computers, printers, cameras, cell phones, and other multimedia devices. These guidelines are built upon existing public standards, but the guidelines themselves are private (available for a fee). These guidelines specify a set of restricted ways of using the standards in order to achieve interoperability.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/Dlna.svg/219px-Dlna.svg.png
