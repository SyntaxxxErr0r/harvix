98.1	Macro_photography	Macrophotography	Macrophotography is close-up photography, usually of very small subjects. Classically a macrophotograph is one in which the size of the subject on the negative is greater than life size. However in modern use it refers to a finished photograph of a subject at greater than life size. The ratio of the subject size on the film plane (or image sensor plane) to the actual subject size is known as the reproduction ratio. Likewise, a macro lens is classically one lens capable of reproduction ratios greater than 1:1, although it now refers to any lens with a large reproduction ratio, despite rarely exceeding 1:1.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Scatophaga_stercoraria_macro_Luc_Viatour.jpg/200px-Scatophaga_stercoraria_macro_Luc_Viatour.jpg
