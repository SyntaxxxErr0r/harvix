80.0	IEC_8859-1	ISO/IEC 8859-1	ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998, Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1987. It is informally referred to as Latin-1. It is generally intended for “Western European” languages (see below for a list). It is by far the most popular 8-bit character set in the world, and virtually every character set in modern use shares some similarity to it (for instance it defines the first 256 code point assignments in Unicode).
