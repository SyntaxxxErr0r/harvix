2.00	Jasice	Jasice	Jasice is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Wojciechowice, within Opatów County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It lies approximately 3 kilometres (2 mi) east of Wojciechowice, 15 km (9 mi) east of Opatów, and 71 km (44 mi) east of the regional capital Kielce. It is completely surrounded by the area of the village of Bidziny on all sides. The town was formed when due to several routing errors of trains in occupied Poland, Nazi German renamed the railway station to Jasice to resolve the issue. In the period after the war several homes built near by incorrectly took the name of Jasice rather than Bidziny leading to the development of the village of Jasice which consists of the Station and several close houses only. To highlight this, the local farm supplies store which is approximate 20 meters from the station on the same road is located in Bidziny in addition to several nearby houses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Poland_location_map.svg/250px-Poland_location_map.svg.png
