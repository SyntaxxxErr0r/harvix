125.6	Aquifer	Aquifer	An aquifer is a wet underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials from which groundwater can be usefully extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and the characfuterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer. If the impermeable area overlies the aquifer pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Aquifer_en.svg/400px-Aquifer_en.svg.png
