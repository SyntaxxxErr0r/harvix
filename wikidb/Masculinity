51.1	Masculinity	Masculinity	Masculinity is possessing qualities or characteristics considered typical of or appropriate to a man. The term can be used to describe any human, animal or object that has the quality of being masculine. When masculine is used to describe men, it can have degrees of comparisonâ€”more masculine, most masculine. The opposite can be expressed by terms such as unmanly or epicene. A typical near-synonym of masculinity is virility (from Latin vir, man); and the usual complement is femininity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Landsdowne_Herakles.jpg/220px-Landsdowne_Herakles.jpg
