70.1	Tenochtitlan	Tenochtitlan	Tenochtitlan located on an island in Lake Texcoco, in the Valley of Mexico. Founded in 1325, it became the capital of the abounding Aztec Empire in the 15th century, until captured by the Spanish in 1521. When paired with Mexico the name is a reference to Mexica, the people of the surrounding Aztec heartland. It subsequently became a cabecera of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and today the ruins of Tenochtitlan are located in the central part of Mexico City.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/TenochtitlanModel.JPG/250px-TenochtitlanModel.JPG
