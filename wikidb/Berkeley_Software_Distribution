120.4	Berkeley_Software_Distribution	Berkeley Software Distribution	Berkeley Software Distribution is a Unix operating system derivative developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) of the University of California, Berkeley, from 1977 to 1995. Today the term "BSD" is often non-specifically used to refer to any of the BSD descendants which together form a branch of the family of Unix-like operating systems. Operating systems derived from the original BSD code remain actively developed and widely used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Unix_history-simple.png/250px-Unix_history-simple.png
