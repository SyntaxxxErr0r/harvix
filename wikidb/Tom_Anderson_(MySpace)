62.4	Tom_Anderson_(MySpace)	Tom Anderson	Thomas "Tom" Anderson (born November 8, 1970) is an American internet entrepreneur. He co-founded the social networking website Myspace in 2003 with Chris DeWolfe, and was later president of Myspace and a strategic adviser for the company until he left in 2009. Because newly-created Myspace accounts initially included Tom as a default "friend", his face became known as the default picture of Myspace, and he is often referred to as "Tom from Myspace" or "Myspace Tom".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Tom_Anderson.jpg/220px-Tom_Anderson.jpg
