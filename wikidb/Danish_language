96.6	Danish_language	Danish language	By the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, Proto-Norse, had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse. This language began to undergo new changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects, Old West Norse and Old East Norse (Denmark and Sweden).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG/250px-Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG
