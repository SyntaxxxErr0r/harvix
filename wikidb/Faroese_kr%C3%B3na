It is not an independent currency but a version of the Danish krone. Consequently, it does not have an ISO 4217 currency code. The ISO 4217 code for the Danish krone is DKK. The kr贸na is subdivided into 100 oyru (singular oyra).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Denmark_-_Faroe_Islands_-_5_ore_1941.jpg/300px-Denmark_-_Faroe_Islands_-_5_ore_1941.jpg
