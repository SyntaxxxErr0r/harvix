Name day celebrations in Poland traditionally involve a gathering of friends and family at the celebrant's home at the dinner table, followed by drinking and socializing, similarly to birthday celebrations. The song "Sto lat" is sometimes sung. Children, and often adults too, receive presents, just like on their birthday.
