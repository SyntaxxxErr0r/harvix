84.7	Zombie_apocalypse	Zombie (fictional)	Zombies are fictional undead creatures regularly encountered in horror and fantasy themed works. They are typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a hunger for human flesh, and particularly for human brains in some depictions. Although they share their name and some superficial similarities with the zombie from Haitian Vodun, their links to such folklore are unclear and many consider George A. Romero's seminal film The Night of the Living Dead to be the progenitor of these creatures. By 2011 the influence of zombies in popular consciousness had reached far enough that government agencies were using them to garner greater attention in public service messages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Zombies_NightoftheLivingDead.jpg/220px-Zombies_NightoftheLivingDead.jpg
