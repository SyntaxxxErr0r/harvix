94.5	Armistice_Day	Armistice Day	Armistice Day (which overlaps with Remembrance Day) is on 11 November and commemorates the armistice signed between the Allies of World War I and Germany at Compiègne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War I, which took effect at eleven o'clock in the morning—the "eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month" of 1918. While this official date to mark the end of the war reflects the cease fire on the Western Front, hostilities continued in other regions, especially across the former Russian Empire and in parts of the old Ottoman Empire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/1918Toronto_BayandKing_Armistace_Day.jpg/300px-1918Toronto_BayandKing_Armistace_Day.jpg
