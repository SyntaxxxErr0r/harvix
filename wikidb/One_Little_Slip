1.00	One_Little_Slip	Barenaked Ladies Are Me	Barenaked Ladies Are Me (usually abbreviated BLAM, and occasionally Are Me or BLAMe) is the seventh full-length original-material studio album by Barenaked Ladies. It was their first original-material album since 2003's Everything to Everyone. It was released in September 2006 internationally. The album was also the first full-length original-material album from the band following their decision not to re-sign with Reprise and become independent. The cover art was created by a group of artists called Team Macho. The name has been cited by the band as a double entendre for "Barenaked Ladies Army".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/BNLMe.jpg/220px-BNLMe.jpg
