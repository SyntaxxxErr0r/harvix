1.00	Separ,_New_Mexico	Separ, New Mexico	Separ is an unincorporated community in Grant County in the bootheel of southwestern New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Although it currently has a small population, it is considered a ghost town. Separ lies in the endorheic Guzm√°n Basin; as a result the continental divide passes both to the west and east of it. Located along side the tracks of the Union Pacific, it flousihed in the late 19th and early 20th century as a watering station and livestock transfer point. Separ is located alongside Interstate 10, about 20 miles southeast of Lordsburg and 48 miles west of Deming. Today it is a "service point for truck and car traffic."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/USA_New_Mexico_location_map.svg/250px-USA_New_Mexico_location_map.svg.png
