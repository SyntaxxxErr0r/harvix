1.00	Dian_xin	Dim sum	Dim sum refers to a style of Chinese food prepared as small bite-sized or individual portions of food traditionally served in small steamer baskets or on small plates. Dim sum is also well known for the unique way it is served in some restaurants, wherein fully cooked and ready-to-serve dim sum dishes are carted around the restaurant for customers to choose their orders while seated at their tables.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Dimsum_breakfast_in_Hong_Kong.jpg/220px-Dimsum_breakfast_in_Hong_Kong.jpg
