66.7	Zombie_walk	Zombie walk	A zombie walk (also known as a zombie mob, zombie march, zombie horde, zombie lurch, zombie shamble, zombie shuffle, zombie monsta-mash, zombie irrigation, zombie hurricane or zombie crawl) is an organized public gathering of people who dress up in zombie costumes. Usually taking place in an urban center, the participants make their way around the city streets and through shopping malls to a public space (or a series of taverns in the case of a zombie pub crawl) in a somewhat orderly fashion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Day_17_Occupy_Wall_Street_October_3_2011_Shankbone_2.JPG/225px-Day_17_Occupy_Wall_Street_October_3_2011_Shankbone_2.JPG
