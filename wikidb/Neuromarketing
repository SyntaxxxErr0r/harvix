56.4	Neuromarketing	Neuromarketing	The base of neuromarketing is “meme” (by Richard Dawkins - a unit of cultural information similar to gene). Meme is a unit of information stored in the brain. These units are effective influencing human who is making choices and decisions within 2.6 seconds. If “meme” is chosen properly we remember the good, joke or song and would share it. “Memes stay in memory and they are affected by marketers”.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Gray739.png/130px-Gray739.png
