64.7	Phagocytosis	Phagocytosis	Phagocytosis (from Ancient Greek (phagein) , meaning "to devour", , (kytos) , meaning " cell", and -osis, meaning "process") is the cellular process of engulfing solid particles by the cell membrane to form an internal phagosome by phagocytes and protists. Phagocytosis is a specific form of endocytosis involving the vesicular internalization of solids such as bacteria, and is, therefore, distinct from other forms of endocytosis such as the vesicular internalization of various liquids. Phagocytosis is involved in the acquisition of nutrients for some cells, and, in the immune system, it is a major mechanism used to remove pathogens and cell debris. Bacteria, dead tissue cells, and small mineral particles are all examples of objects that may be phagocytosed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Phagocytosis_in_three_steps.png/250px-Phagocytosis_in_three_steps.png
