23.60	Mr._Eko	Mr. Eko	Mr. Eko Tunde is a fictional character, played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje on the ABC television series Lost. He is introduced in the second season episode "Adrift" as one of the plane-crash survivors from the plane's tail section. Flashbacks reveal that he became the leader of a gang of guerrillas to save his brother when he still lived in Nigeria. He took the identity of his brother and became a priest after his brother was killed in a botched drug smuggle. Eko killed two guerrillas in defense, was ostracized, and left Nigeria to become a priest in Australia. After investigating the "fake miracle" of a girl who came back to life after drowning in Australia in 2004, Eko boarded Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. This plane crashed and left Eko, along with a few other survivors, on a deserted island.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/Ekolost.PNG/250px-Ekolost.PNG
