4.32	Before_the_Frost...Until_the_Freeze	Before the Frost...Until the Freeze	Before the Frost...Until the Freeze is a 2009 double album by blues rock band The Black Crowes. It was recorded before a live audience at Levon Helm's Woodstock, NY studio, The Barn in late February and early March, 2009. The album was produced by long time band collaborator Paul Stacey, and released on Silver Arrow Records. The CD itself is designed to have the appearance of a vinyl record. Originally, only the Before the Frost portion of the double album was available on CD, and the CD purchase came with a code allowing download of the Until the Freeze portion from the Black Crowes website. A vinyl version was also released, featuring all songs but in a different running order.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ea/The_Black_Crowes_-_Before_The_Frost_Until_The_Freeze.jpg/220px-The_Black_Crowes_-_Before_The_Frost_Until_The_Freeze.jpg
