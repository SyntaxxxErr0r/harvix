58.6	The_Ashes	The Ashes	The Ashes is a Test cricket series played between England and Australia since 1882. It is one of the most celebrated rivalries in international cricket and is currently played biennially, alternately in England and Australia. Cricket being a summer sport, and the venues being in opposite hemispheres, the break between series alternates between 18 and 30 months. A series of "The Ashes" comprises five Test matches, two innings per match, under the regular rules for Test match cricket. If a series is drawn then the country already holding the Ashes retains them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Ashes_Urn.jpg/220px-Ashes_Urn.jpg
