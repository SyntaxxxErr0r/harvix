205.5	Green_roof	Green roof	A green roof or living roof is a roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. It may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems. (The word "green" refers to environmentalism and not the color green, as with green roof tiles or roof shingles).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Nor%C3%B0rag%C3%B8ta%2C_Faroe_Islands_%282%29.JPG/220px-Nor%C3%B0rag%C3%B8ta%2C_Faroe_Islands_%282%29.JPG
