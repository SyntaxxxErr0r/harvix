15.42	Bushel's_Case	Bushel's Case	Bushel's Case arose from a previous case involving two Quakers charged with unlawful assembly, William Penn and William Mead. They had been arrested in August 1670 for violating the Conventicle Act, which forbade religious assemblies of more than five people outside the auspices of the Church of England. The judge in their case charged the jury that they "shall not be dismissed until we have a verdict that the court will accept." When the jury acquitted the two men, the judge refused to accept the verdict, fined them and sent them back to deliberate further. Edward Bushel, a member of the jury, refused to pay the fine, at which point the judge threatened him, saying, " ou shall be locked up without meat, drink, fire, and tobacco. You shall not think thus to abuse the court; we will have a verdict, by the help of God, or you shall starve for it."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/John_Vaughan_%281603-1674%29%2C_follower_of_John_Michael_Wright.jpg/220px-John_Vaughan_%281603-1674%29%2C_follower_of_John_Michael_Wright.jpg
