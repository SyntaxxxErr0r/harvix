2.20	Burlington%2C_North_Dakota	Burlington, North Dakota	Burlington is a city in Ward County, North Dakota in the United States. Burlington was founded in 1883, having been third in a series that included two earlier settlements. Despite this, Burlington is still the oldest city in Ward County, as well as north-western and north central North Dakota. In 1885, as it was the only city in the then-newly formed Imperial Ward County (now split into Ward, Renville, Mountrail, and Burke counties), it was given the county seat, a position it held until 1888. The population was 1,060 at the 2010 census.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Burlington%2C_North_Dakota.jpg/250px-Burlington%2C_North_Dakota.jpg
