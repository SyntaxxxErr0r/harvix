4.10	Jan_Sobieski	John III Sobieski	John III Sobieski (Polish: , Lithuanian: ) (17 August 1629 – 17 June 1696) was one of the most notable monarchs of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, from 1674 until his death King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. Sobieski's 22-year-reign was marked by a period of the Commonwealth's stabilization, much needed after the turmoil of the Deluge and Khmelnytsky Uprising. Popular among his subjects, he was an able military commander, most famous for the victory over the Turks in the 1683 Battle of Vienna. Following his victories over the Ottoman Empire, he was called by the Turks the "Lion of Lechistan" and held as the saviour of European Christendom by the pope.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Signature_of_John_III_of_Poland.PNG/125px-Signature_of_John_III_of_Poland.PNG
