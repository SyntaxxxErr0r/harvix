Along with the Minoans and Mycenaeans, the Cycladic people are counted among the three major Aegean cultures. Cycladic art therefore comprises one of the three main branches of Aegean art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Cycladic_harp_player.jpg/220px-Cycladic_harp_player.jpg
