57.7	Breakfast	Breakfast	Breakfast (literally meaning "breaking the fast" of the night) is the first meal taken after rising from a night's sleep, most often eaten in the early morning before undertaking the day's work. Among English speakers, "breakfast" can be used to refer to this meal, or, less commonly, to refer to a meal composed of traditional breakfast foods (eggs, oatmeal, sausages, etc.) served at any time of day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Floris_Claesz._van_Dyck_001.jpg/180px-Floris_Claesz._van_Dyck_001.jpg
