Many characters are masked, with men playing male and female roles. Traditionally, a Noh "performance day" lasts all day and consists of five Noh plays interspersed with shorter, humorous kyōgen pieces. However, present-day Noh performances often consist of two Noh plays with one Kyōgen play in between.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Noh3.jpg/250px-Noh3.jpg
