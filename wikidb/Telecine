62.5	Telecine	Telecine	Telecine ( or ) is the process of transferring motion picture film into video and is performed in a color suite. The term is also used to refer to the equipment used in the post-production process. Telecine enables a motion picture, captured originally on film stock, to be viewed with standard video equipment, such as television sets, video cassette recorders (VCR) or computers. This allows film producers, television producers and film distributors working in the film industry to release their products on video and allows producers to use video production equipment to complete their filmmaking projects. Within the film industry, it is also referred to as a TK, as TC is already used to designate time code.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/SDC-2000_Spirit_DataCine_Telecine.JPG/250px-SDC-2000_Spirit_DataCine_Telecine.JPG
