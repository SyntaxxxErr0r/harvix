1.21	Duodenal_cytochrome_B	Duodenal cytochrome B	Duodenal cytochrome B (Dcytb) has been identified as the reductase enzyme which catalyzes the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in the process of iron absorption in the duodenum of mammals. According to research carried out, it appears that Dcytb upregulation is controlled by a number of independent stimulators or inhibitors of iron absorption. Furthermore, Dcytb has also been shown to exist in other tissues besides the apical region of the duodenum; and as such, it is believed to play a major role in iron metabolism in tissues.
