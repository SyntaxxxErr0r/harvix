71.0	Systems_engineering	Systems engineering	Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering focusing on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed over their life cycles. Issues such as logistics, the coordination of different teams, and automatic control of machinery become more difficult when dealing with large, complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes and tools to manage risks on such projects, and it overlaps with both technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering, industrial engineering, organizational studies, and project management.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Systems_engineering_application_projects_collage.jpg/280px-Systems_engineering_application_projects_collage.jpg
