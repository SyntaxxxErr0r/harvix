59.6	Mucus	Mucus	In vertebrates, mucus , immunoglobulins, inorganic salts, proteins such as lactoferrin, and glycoproteins known as mucins that are produced by goblet cells in the mucous membranes and submucosal glands. This mucus serves to protect epithelial cells in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, visual, and auditory systems in mammals; the epidermis in amphibians; and the gills in fish. A major function of this mucus is to protect against infectious agents such as fungi, bacteria and viruses. The average human body produces about a litre of mucus per day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Mucus_cells.png/220px-Mucus_cells.png
