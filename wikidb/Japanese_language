It is distinguished by a complex system of honorifics reflecting the nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned in conversation. Japanese vowels are pure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Japanese_language_extension.PNG/300px-Japanese_language_extension.PNG
