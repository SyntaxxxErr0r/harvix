The host of CNBC's Mad Money, Cramer appeared in response to host Jon Stewart's highly-publicized week-long criticism of CNBC. The exchange began with a scathing piece on CNBC's miscalculations regarding the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009 in response to Rick Santelli, who had recently said on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade that homeowners facing foreclosure were "losers". Santelli had been set to appear on the show, but CNBC canceled Santelli’s appearance. Stewart, along with Daily Show executives, claimed the CNBC montage was not retaliatory and that they planned to show it before the cancellation was announced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Stewart_commenting_on_CNBC.jpg
