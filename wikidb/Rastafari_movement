99.2	Rastafari_movement	Rastafari movement	The Rastafari movement or Rasta is a new religious movement. It arose in the 1930s in Jamaica, a country with a predominantly Christian culture where 98% of the people were the black descendants of slaves. Most of its adherents worship Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia (ruled 1930â€“1974), as God incarnate, the Second Advent, or the reincarnation of Jesus. Members of the Rastafari movement are known as Rastas, or Rastafari. The movement is sometimes referred to as "Rastafarianism", but this term is considered derogatory and offensive by some Rastas, who, being highly critical of "isms" (which they see as a typical part of Babylon culture), dislike being labelled as an "ism" themselves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Flag_of_Ethiopia_%281897-1936%3B_1941-1974%29.svg/100px-Flag_of_Ethiopia_%281897-1936%3B_1941-1974%29.svg.png
