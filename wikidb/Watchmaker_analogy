51.9	Watchmaker_analogy	Watchmaker analogy	The watchmaker analogy, or watchmaker argument, is a teleological argument for the existence of God. By way of an analogy, the argument states that design implies a designer. The analogy has played a prominent role in natural theology and the "argument from design," where it was used to support arguments for the existence of God and for the intelligent design of the universe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/BwcOmega911a.jpg/180px-BwcOmega911a.jpg
