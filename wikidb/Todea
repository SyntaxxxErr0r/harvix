3.10	Todea	Todea	The fern genus Todea is known from only two living species. Todea barbara L., known as the king fern, is native to South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia while Todea papuana H. is known only from Papua New Guinea. Species in the genus Todea, as Leptopteris, are distinct from other in Osmundaceae in that sporangia are born on laminar pinnules.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Todea_barbara_-_University_of_California_Botanical_Garden_-_DSC08895.JPG/220px-Todea_barbara_-_University_of_California_Botanical_Garden_-_DSC08895.JPG
