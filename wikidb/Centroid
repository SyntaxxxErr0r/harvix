64.8	Centroid	Centroid	In geometry, the centroid, geometric center, or barycenter of a plane figure or two-dimensional shape X is the intersection of all straight lines that divide X into two parts of equal moment about the line. Informally, it is the "average" of all points of X. The definition extends to any object X in n-dimensional space: its centroid is the intersection of all hyperplanes that divide X into two parts of equal moment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Triangle.Centroid.svg/220px-Triangle.Centroid.svg.png
