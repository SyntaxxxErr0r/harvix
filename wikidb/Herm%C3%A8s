59.0	Herm%C3%A8s	Hermès	The Hermès family, originally Protestant Germans, settled in France in 1828. In 1837, Thierry Hermès (1801–1878) first established Hermès as a harness workshop on the Grands Boulevards quarter of Paris, dedicated to serving European noblemen. He created some of the finest wrought harnesses and bridles for the carriage trade. Monsieur Hermès's earned citations included the first prize in its class in 1855 and the first-class medal in 1867 at the Expositions Universelles in Paris.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Herm%C3%A8s.svg/150px-Herm%C3%A8s.svg.png
