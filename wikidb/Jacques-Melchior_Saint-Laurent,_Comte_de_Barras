1.00	Jacques-Melchior_Saint-Laurent,_Comte_de_Barras	Jacques-Melchior Saint-Laurent, Comte de Barras	In early 1781 Barras' French squadron was based at Newport, Rhode Island. His orders from France were to mount an expedition against Newfoundland. Barras was persuaded by the Comte de Rochambeau to instead go southwards and rendezvous with Admiral De Grasse who had brought his French fleet from the West Indies. The series of events led to the surrender of a British Army at Yorktown.
