157.9	Hyperinflation	Hyperinflation	By definition, inflation is an increase in the money supply without a corresponding increase in real output causing an increase in general price levels. Per Milton Friedman "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon". Hyperinflation is generally considered to be an increase of over 50% in price levels. This increase is caused by decisions on the part of the central bank to increase the money supply at a high rate leading to a loss in its value. Per basic economic principles, an increase in supply of a good will cause a drop in its value. This loss in value is usually exacerbated by an increase in the velocity of money (how fast it is spent) as people rush to exchange (or spend) it for almost anything else. In extreme cases this can cause a complete loss of confidence in the money, similar to a bank run. This loss of confidence causes a rapid increase in the velocity of spending, as people rush to get rid of what they perceive to be a rapidly devaluing asset in exchange for almost anything else of value, causing a corresponding rapid increase in prices. For example, once inflation has become established, sellers try to hedge against it by increasing prices. This leads to further waves of price increases. Hyperinflation will continue as long as the entity responsible for increasing bank credit and/or printing currency continues to engage in excessive money creation. In severe cases, legal tender laws and price controls to prevent discounting the value of paper money relative to hard currency or commodities can fail to force acceptance of the rapidly increasing money supply which lacks intrinsic value, in which case hyperinflation usually continues until the currency is abandoned entirely.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Inflaci%C3%B3_utan_1946.jpg/220px-Inflaci%C3%B3_utan_1946.jpg
