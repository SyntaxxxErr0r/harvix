188.5	James_Joyce	James Joyce	James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 â€“ 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist and poet, considered to be one of the most influential writers in the modernist avant-garde of the early 20th century. Joyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer's Odyssey are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles, perhaps most prominently the stream of consciousness technique he perfected. Other major works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). His complete oeuvre includes three books of poetry, a play, occasional journalism, and his published letters.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Revolutionary_Joyce_Better_Contrast.jpg/220px-Revolutionary_Joyce_Better_Contrast.jpg
