62.3	Graffiti_(Palm_OS)	Graffiti (Palm OS)	Graffiti is an essentially single-stroke shorthand handwriting recognition system used in PDAs based on the Palm OS. Graffiti was originally written by Palm, Inc. as the recognition system for GEOS-based devices such as HP's OmniGo 120 or the Magic Cap-line and was available as an alternate recognition system for the Apple Newton MessagePad, when NewtonOS 1.0 couldn't recognize handwriting very well. Graffiti also runs on the Windows Mobile platform, where it is called "Block Recognizer", and on the Symbian UIQ platform as the default recognizer and was available for Casio's Zoomer PDA.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Palm_Graffiti_gestures.png/220px-Palm_Graffiti_gestures.png
