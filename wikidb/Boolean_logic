93.5	Boolean_logic	Boolean algebra	Boolean algebra, as developed in 1854 by George Boole in his book An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, is a variant of ordinary elementary algebra differing in its values, operations, and laws. Instead of the usual algebra of numbers, Boolean algebra is the algebra of truth values 0 and 1, or equivalently of subsets of a given set. The operations are usually taken to be conjunction ∧, disjunction ∨, and negation ¬, with constants 0 and 1. And the laws are definable as those equations that hold for all values of their variables, for example x∨ = x. Applications include mathematical logic, digital logic, computer programming, set theory, and statistics.. According to Huntington the moniker "Boolean algebra" was first suggested by Sheffer in 1913.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Vennandornot.svg/500px-Vennandornot.svg.png
