153.8	Quicksort	Quicksort	Quicksort is a sorting algorithm developed by Tony Hoare that, on average, makes comparisons to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes comparisons, though this behavior is rare. Quicksort is often faster in practice than other algorithms. Additionally, quicksort's sequential and localized memory references work well with a cache. Quicksort can be implemented with an in-place partitioning algorithm, so the entire sort can be done with only additional space.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Sorting_quicksort_anim.gif
