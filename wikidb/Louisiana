217.9	Louisiana	Louisiana	Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural, multilingual heritage, being so strongly influenced by an admixture of 18th century French, Spanish, Native American (Indian) and African cultures that they are considered to be somewhat exceptional in the U.S. Before the American influx and statehood at the beginning of the 19th century, the territory of current Louisiana State had been a Spanish and French colony. In addition, the pattern of development included importing numerous African slaves in the 18th century, with many from the same region of West Africa, thus concentrating their culture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Flag_of_Louisiana.svg/125px-Flag_of_Louisiana.svg.png
