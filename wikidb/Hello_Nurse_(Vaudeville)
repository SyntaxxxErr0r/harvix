2.01	Hello_Nurse_(Vaudeville)	Hello Nurse (vaudeville)	"Hello, nurse!" was a popular catcall used during the heyday of vaudeville. One of many running gags used in many vaudeville shows was the appearance of a voluptuous, suggestively-dressed woman wearing a nurse's uniform. Upon her appearance, the main characters in the vaudeville sketch would call out, "Hello, NURSE!" This phrase is also the basis for the wolf whistle used in the United States and other countries to suggest that a pretty girl has entered the room.
