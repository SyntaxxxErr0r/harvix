119.6	Sandwich	Sandwich	A sandwich is a food item, typically consisting of two or more slices of bread with one or more fillings between them, or one slice of bread with a topping or toppings, commonly called an open sandwich . Sandwiches are a widely popular type of lunch food, typically taken to work or school, or picnics to be eaten as part of a packed lunch. They generally contain a combination of salad vegetables, meat, cheese, and a variety of sauces or savoury spreads. The bread can be used as it is, or it can be coated with any condiments to enhance flavour and texture. They are widely sold in restaurants and cafes. Several examples of unconventional sandwiches include tacos, burritos, and pizza.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Salami_sandwich.jpg/220px-Salami_sandwich.jpg
