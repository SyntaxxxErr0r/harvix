8.20	Fromage	Fromage	Fromage was an annual one-hour special produced by the Canadian MuchMusic cable channel. Originally hosted by songwriter (and MuchMusic VJ) Christopher Ward, beginning in the late 1980s (later co-hosting with Natalie Richard), Fromage pays "tribute" to music videos that are considered the worst or cheesiest of the year by MuchMusic staff.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Fromage2005.png
