58.4	Synthetic_fiber	Synthetic fiber	Synthetic fibres are the result of extensive research by scientists to improve on naturally occurring animal and plant fibres. In general, synthetic fibres are created by forcing, usually through extrusion, fiber forming materials through holes (called spinnerets) into the air, forming a thread. Before synthetic fibres were developed, artificially manufactured fibers were made from cellulose, which comes from plants. These fibres are called cellulose fibres.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Kapok_seeds_I_IMG_8004.jpg/140px-Kapok_seeds_I_IMG_8004.jpg
