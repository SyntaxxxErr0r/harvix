70.1	The_Honeymooners	The Honeymooners	The Honeymooners is an American sitcom, based on a recurring 1951–55 sketch of the same name. It originally aired on the DuMont network's Cavalcade of Stars and subsequently on the CBS network's The Jackie Gleason Show hosted by Jackie Gleason, and filmed before a live audience. It debuted as a half-hour series on October 1, 1955. Although initially a ratings success — becoming the #2 show in the United States its first season — it faced stiff competition from the Perry Como Show, and eventually dropped to #19, ending its production after only 39 episodes (now referred to as the "Classic 39"). The final episode of The Honeymooners aired on September 22, 1956. Gleason went on to revive The Honeymooners as sketches and hour-long specials off and on through 1978.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/The_Honeymooners_title_screen.png/200px-The_Honeymooners_title_screen.png
