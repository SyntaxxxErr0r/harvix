128.5	Gregor_Mendel	Gregor Mendel	Gregor Johann Mendel (July 20, 1822 â€“ January 6, 1884) was an Austrian scientist and Augustinian friar who gained posthumous fame as the founder of the new science of genetics. Mendel demonstrated that the inheritance of certain traits in pea plants follows particular patterns, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance. Although the significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century, the independent rediscovery of these laws formed the foundation of the modern science of genetics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Gregor_Mendel.png/190px-Gregor_Mendel.png
