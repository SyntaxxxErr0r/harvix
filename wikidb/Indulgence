106.0	Indulgence	Indulgence	In Catholic theology, an indulgence is the full or partial remission of temporal punishment due for sins which have already been forgiven. The indulgence is granted by the Catholic Church after the sinner has confessed and received absolution. The belief is that indulgences draw on the Treasury of Merit accumulated by Christ's superabundantly meritorious sacrifice on the cross and the virtues and penances of the saints. They are granted for specific good works and prayers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Indulgence_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg/220px-Indulgence_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg
