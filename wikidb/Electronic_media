68.5	Electronic_media	Electronic media	Electronic media are media that use electronics or electromechanical energy for the end-user to access the content. This is in contrast to static media (mainly print media), which today are most often created electronically, but don't require electronics to be accessed by the end-user in the printed form. The primary electronic media sources familiar to the general public are better known as video recordings, audio recordings, multimedia presentations, slide presentations, CD-ROM and online content. Most new media are in the form of digital media. However, electronic media may be in either analog or digital format.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Webpage.png/200px-Webpage.png
