1.00	Individual_Transferable_Quotas	Individual fishing quota	The term catch share has been used more recently to describe the range of programs similar to ITQs. Catch shares expanded the concept of daily catch limits to yearlong limits, allowed different fishers to have different limits based on various factors, and also limited the total catch. Under catch share approaches, threatened fisheries became sustainable by keeping the totals low enough and enforcing the limits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/3875_aquaimages.jpg/140px-3875_aquaimages.jpg
