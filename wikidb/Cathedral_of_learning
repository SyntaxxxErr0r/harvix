Standing at 535 feet (&gt;163 m), the 42-story Late Gothic Revival Cathedral is the tallest educational building in the Western hemisphere and the second tallest university building (fourth tallest educationally-purposed building) in the world. The Cathedral of Learning was commissioned in 1921 and ground was broken in 1926. The first class was held in the building in 1931 and its exterior finished in October 1934, prior to its formal dedication in June, 1937. The Cathedral is a steel frame structure overlaid with Indiana limestone and contains more than 2,000 rooms and windows. The building is often used by the University in photographs, postcards, and other advertisements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Cathedral_of_Learning_stitch_1.jpg/250px-Cathedral_of_Learning_stitch_1.jpg
