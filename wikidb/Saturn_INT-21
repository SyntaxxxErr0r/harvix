7.01	Saturn_INT-21	Saturn INT-21	The Saturn INT-21 was a study for an American orbital launch vehicle of the 1970s. It was derived from the Saturn V rocket used for the Apollo program, using its first and second stages, but lacking the third stage. The guidance unit would be moved from the top of the third stage to the top of the second stage. The INT-21 was never flown in this form.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Skylab_launch_on_Saturn_V.jpg/220px-Skylab_launch_on_Saturn_V.jpg
