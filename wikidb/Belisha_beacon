19.02	Belisha_beacon	Belisha beacon	A Belisha beacon is an amber-coloured globe lamp atop a tall black and white pole, marking pedestrian crossings of roads in the United Kingdom, Ireland and in other countries (e.g., Hong Kong, Malta) historically influenced by Britain. It was named after Leslie Hore-Belisha (1893â€“1957), the Minister of Transport who in 1934 added beacons to pedestrian crossings, marked by large metal studs in the road surface. These crossings were later painted in black and white stripes, thus are known as zebra crossings. Legally pedestrians have the right of way (over wheeled traffic) on such crossings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/BelishaBeacon2750Canthusus.jpg/220px-BelishaBeacon2750Canthusus.jpg
