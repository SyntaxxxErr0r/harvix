66.0	Cytoplasm	Cytoplasm	The cytoplasm is the gel-like substance residing between the cell membrane holding all the cell's internal sub-structures (called organelles), except for the nucleus. All the contents of the cells of prokaryote organisms (which lack a cell nucleus) are contained within the cytoplasm. Within the cells of eukaryote organisms the contents of the cell nucleus are separated from the cytoplasm, and are then called the nucleoplasm. The cytoplasm is 80% water and usually clear in color.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Biological_cell.svg/300px-Biological_cell.svg.png
