They are typically distinguished by their simple rules and lack of commitment required in contrast to more complex hardcore games. They require no long-term time commitment or special skills to play, and there are comparatively low production and distribution costs for the producer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Vg_development_icon.svg/100px-Vg_development_icon.svg.png
