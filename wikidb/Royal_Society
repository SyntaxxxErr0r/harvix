138.8	Royal_Society	Royal Society	The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, known as the Royal Society, is a learned society for science, and is possibly the oldest such society in existence. Founded in November 1660, it was granted a Royal Charter by King Charles II as the "Royal Society of London". The Society today acts as a scientific advisor to the British government, receiving a parliamentary grant-in-aid. The Society acts as the UK's Academy of Sciences, and funds research fellowships and scientific start-up companies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Arms_of_the_Royal_Society.svg/150px-Arms_of_the_Royal_Society.svg.png
