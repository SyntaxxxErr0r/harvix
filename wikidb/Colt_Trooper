3.00	Colt_Trooper	Colt Trooper	Introduced to the firearms market by the Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1953, the Colt Trooper is a medium frame double-action revolver featuring a six-round cylinder, chambered for .22 and .38 caliber cartridges. Designed as a less expensive alternative to the upscale Colt .357 and the later Python, it was marketed to law enforcement agencies as well as civilian firearms enthusiasts and collectors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Colt_Trooper_Mk3.jpg/300px-Colt_Trooper_Mk3.jpg
