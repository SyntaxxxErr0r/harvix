67.7	Melting_point	Melting point	For most substances, melting and freezing points are approximately equal. For example, the melting point and freezing point of the element mercury is 234.32 kelvin (−38.83 °C or −37.89 °F). However, certain substances possess differing solid-liquid transition temperatures. For example, agar melts at 85 °C (185 °F) and solidifies from 31 °C to 40 °C (89.6 °F to 104 °F); this process is known as hysteresis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Carboxylic.Acids.Melting.%26.Boiling.Points.jpg/220px-Carboxylic.Acids.Melting.%26.Boiling.Points.jpg
