Sears is known today primarily as the man who penned the words to "It Came Upon the Midnight Clear" in 1849. It has been sung to two tunes, one by Richard Storrs Willis and another adapted by Arthur Sullivan from a traditional English air.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Edmund_H_Sears.jpg
