97.8	Triathlon	Triathlon	A triathlon is a multi-sport event involving the completion of three continuous and sequential endurance events. While many variations of the sport exist, triathlon, in its most popular form, involves swimming, cycling, and running in immediate succession over various distances. Triathletes compete for fastest overall course completion time, including timed "transitions" between the individual swim, bike, and run components. The word "triathlon" is of Greek origin from τρεις or trei (three) and αθλος or athlos (contest).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Tri_swim_bike_run.jpg/400px-Tri_swim_bike_run.jpg
