The eastern part of the Oregon Trail spanned part of the future state of Kansas and nearly all of what are now the states of Nebraska and Wyoming. The western half of the trail spanned most of the future states of Idaho and Oregon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Wpdms_nasa_topo_oregon_trail.jpg/284px-Wpdms_nasa_topo_oregon_trail.jpg
