Two sections were built but the project was cancelled, mainly for environmental reasons. It is now a protected green belt corridor, one mile (1.6 km) wide in most places. Named after the leader in the opposition against the canal, Marjorie Harris Carr, it is known as the Marjorie Harris Carr Cross Florida Greenway.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Cross_Fla_Barge_canal_SR19W-03.jpg/200px-Cross_Fla_Barge_canal_SR19W-03.jpg
