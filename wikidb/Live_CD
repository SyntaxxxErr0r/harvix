107.1	Live_CD	Live CD	A live CD, live DVD, or live disc is a CD or DVD containing a bootable computer operating system. Live CDs are unique in that they have the ability to run a complete, modern operating system on a computer lacking mutable secondary storage, such as a hard disk drive. Live USB flash drives are similar to live CDs, but often have the added functionality of automatically and transparently writing changes back to their bootable medium. Also, the solid-state device pure electronic operation gives a significant speed advantage by eliminating the CD reader's intrinsic mechanical latencies. Write-locked Live SD WORM systems are the direct solid-state counterpart to live CDs and can be booted natively in a media card slot or by using a USB adapter. Write-locked Live SD systems avoid excessive write cycles or corruption by ill-conditioned software, like viruses, which can prematurely "ruin" a live USB drive's installation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Ubuntu_11.04_%28Natty_Narwhal%29_Beta_2.png/220px-Ubuntu_11.04_%28Natty_Narwhal%29_Beta_2.png
