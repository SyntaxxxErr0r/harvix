53.1	Crystal_structure	Crystal structure	Vectors and atomic planes in a crystal lattice can be described by a three-value Miller index notation . The ℓ, m, and n directional indices are separated by 90°, and are thus orthogonal. In fact, the ℓ component is mutually perpendicular to the m and n indices.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Insulincrystals.jpg
