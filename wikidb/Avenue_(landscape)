18.43	Avenue_(landscape)	Avenue (landscape)	In landscaping, an avenue or allée is traditionally a straight route with a line of trees or large shrubs running along each, which is used, as its French source venir ("to come") indicates, to emphasize the "coming to," or arrival at a landscape or architectural feature. In most cases, the trees planted in an avenue will be all of the same species or cultivar, so as to give uniform appearance along the full length of the avenue. The French term allée is confined normally to avenues planted in parks and landscape gardens.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Alexandra_park_avenue.jpg/250px-Alexandra_park_avenue.jpg
