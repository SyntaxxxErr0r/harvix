1.10	I'm_One	I'm One	"I'm One" is a song by The Who. It was released on the group's 1973 rock opera album Quadrophenia. Written and sung by Pete Townshend, it is one of the main moments of introspection spread throughout the narrative and also a sign that Jimmy may not be as Mod as he appears, given the way he asks a fellow Mod where he got his clothes. (Mods would lose face asking another Mod where he got his clothes.) The song features an acoustic opening followed by the rest of the band (excluding singer Roger Daltrey) joining in.
