161.1	Andy_Kaufman	Andy Kaufman	Andrew Geoffrey "Andy" Kaufman (January 17, 1949 â€“ May 16, 1984) was an American entertainer, actor and performance artist. While often referred to as a comedian, Kaufman did not consider himself one. He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, referring to himself instead as a "song-and-dance man." Elaborate hoaxes and pranks were major elements of his career. His act maintains a cult following and he continues to be respected among comedians for his original material, performance style, and unflinching commitment to character.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Akaufman1.jpg
