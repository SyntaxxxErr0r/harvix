1.00	Napalm_Brain	Napalm Brain	Napalm Brain were a psychedelic rock trio hailing from Manchester, England. The group was composed of Greg Owens on guitar, Felix Burnett on bass and vocals, and Marc Lyxzén providing the drums and percussion. Only active from the spring of 1967 until autumn in 1972, Napalm Brain still released material including their second album, Iron Moon. It showcased Owens' blues-on-acid guitar style, Burnett's melodic basslines, and Lyxzén's drumming, which bears strong resemblance to the stylings of John Bonham.
