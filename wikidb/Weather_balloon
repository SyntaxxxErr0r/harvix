35.60	Weather_balloon	Weather balloon	A weather or sounding balloon is a balloon (specifically a type of high altitude balloon) which carries instruments aloft to send back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed by means of a small, expendable measuring device called a radiosonde. To obtain wind data, they can be tracked by radar, radio direction finding, or navigation systems (such as the satellite-based Global Positioning System, GPS).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/NWS_weather_balloon_station%2C_Riverton_WY.jpg/220px-NWS_weather_balloon_station%2C_Riverton_WY.jpg
