1.11	Farewell_Song	Farewell Song	Farewell Song is a 1982 collection of Janis Joplin performances with Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Kozmic Blues Band, and Full Tilt Boogie. Tracks include Cheap Thrills-era outtakes and live performances; "Misery 'N," "Farewell Song" and "Catch Me Daddy." Although the album appeals to Joplin fans as it contains rare tracks, the release displeased Big Brother and the Holding Company who were angry that their original studio instruments were replaced with studio musicians for the 1982 release. A later compilation, Janis, featured all of the bands original material.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/FSJanis.jpg/220px-FSJanis.jpg
