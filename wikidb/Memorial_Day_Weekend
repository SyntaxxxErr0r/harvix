6.11	Memorial_Day_Weekend	Memorial Day	Memorial Day is a United States federal holiday observed annually on the last Monday of May (May 28 in 2012). Formerly known as Decoration Day, it originated after the American Civil War to commemorate the fallen Union soldiers of the Civil War. (Southern ladies organizations and southern schoolchildren had decorated Confederate graves in Richmond and other cities during the Civil War, but each region had its own date. Most dates were in May.) By the 20th century Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who have died in all wars. Memorial Day is a day of remembering the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. As a marker it typically marks the start of the summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Graves_at_Arlington_on_Memorial_Day.JPG/225px-Graves_at_Arlington_on_Memorial_Day.JPG
