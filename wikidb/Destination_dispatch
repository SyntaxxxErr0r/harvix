7.30	Destination_dispatch	Destination dispatch	Destination dispatch is an optimization technique for dispatching elevators to provide passengers with the shortest waiting times and the shortest time to destination. Instead of the classic two-button system, passengers enter the desired destination floor with a keypad or touch screen. The elevator group controller uses a computer algorithm to assign the passenger to an elevator in a bank of elevators.
