1.10	Creep_wit'_Me	Creep wit' Me	Creep Wit' Me is the debut album by East Coast hip hop duo Ill Al Skratch. It was released on August 2, 1994 by Mercury Records. It features slow and smooth production from The LG Experience and LoRider, as well as light party rhymes. It was Ill Al Skratch's most commercially successful album peaking at #137 on the Billboard 200. Nonetheless, Al Skratch blames its lack of more success on poor distribution by Mercury Records. It contains three singles: "Where My Homiez? (Come Around My Way)," "I'll Take Her" and "Chill with That." The first of the three was an underground hit that managed to reach #34 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart. It was followed by "I'll Take Her," a single that featured R&amp;B singer Brian McKnight and reached the Billboard Hot 100. It was followed by the last and least commercially successful of the three singles, "Chill with That."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/36/CreepWitMe.jpg/220px-CreepWitMe.jpg
