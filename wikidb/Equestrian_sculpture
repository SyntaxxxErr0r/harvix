8.33	Equestrian_sculpture	Equestrian statue	An equestrian statue is a statue of a rider mounted on a horse, from the Latin "eques", meaning "knight", deriving from "equus", meaning "horse". A statue of a riderless horse is strictly an "equine statue". A full-size equestrian statue is a difficult and expensive object for any culture to produce, and figures have typically been portraits of rulers or, more recently, military commanders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Marek_Aureliusz_Kapitol.jpg/220px-Marek_Aureliusz_Kapitol.jpg
