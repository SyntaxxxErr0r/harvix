It was founded October 5, 1947, by Elia Kazan, Cheryl Crawford, Robert Lewis and Anna Sokolow who provided training for actors that were members. Lee Strasberg joined later and took the helm in 1951 until his death on February 17, 1982. It is currently run by Al Pacino and Ellen Burstyn. The Studio is best known for its work refining and teaching method acting. This approach was originally developed by the Group Theatre in the 1930s based on the innovations of Constantin Stanislavski. While at the Studio, actors work together to develop their skills in a private environment where they can take risks as performers without the pressure of commercial roles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Actors-studio_crop.jpg/225px-Actors-studio_crop.jpg
