1.00	Quarantining	Quarantine	Quarantine is compulsory isolation, typically to contain the spread of something considered dangerous, often but not always disease. The word comes from the Italian (seventeenth century Venetian) quarantena, meaning forty-day period. Quarantine can be applied to humans, but also to animals of various kinds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/ICS_Lima.svg/220px-ICS_Lima.svg.png
