6.60	Roadrunner_United	Roadrunner United	Roadrunner United was a project organized by the heavy metal record label Roadrunner Records to celebrate its 25th anniversary. It culminated in an album released worldwide on October 11, 2005, entitled The All-Star Sessions. Four "team captains" were chosen to lead 57 artists from 45 past and present Roadrunner bands, and produce and oversee the album's 18 tracks: Joey Jordison of Slipknot and Murderdolls; Matt Heafy of Trivium; Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, Asesino and Divine Heresy and formerly of Brujeria; and Robert Flynn of Machine Head and formerly of Vio-lence and Forbidden. The unprecedented project was the brainchild of Roadrunner UK General Manager Mark Palmer and Roadrunner USA VP of A&amp;R Monte Conner. The album project was coordinated by Lora Richardson and was mixed by Colin Richardson and Andy Sneap. The All-Star Sessions spawned one single and music video ("The End"). The DVD included with the CD purchase is a documentary of the "Making Of" the songs. It features the sessions of the four team captains making their songs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/RoadrunnerUnited.jpg/220px-RoadrunnerUnited.jpg
