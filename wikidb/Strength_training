66.5	Strength_training	Strength training	Strength training is the use of resistance to muscular contraction to build the strength, anaerobic endurance, and size of skeletal muscles. There are many different methods of strength training, the most common being the use of gravity or elastic/hydraulic forces to oppose muscle contraction. See the resistance training article for information about elastic/hydraulic training, but note that the terms "strength training" and "resistance training" are often used interchangeably.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/UPSTREAM_FITNESS-7.jpg/200px-UPSTREAM_FITNESS-7.jpg
