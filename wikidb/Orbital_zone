2.00	Orbital_zone	Clearing the neighbourhood	Stern, currently leading the NASA New Horizons mission to Pluto, disagrees with the reclassification of Pluto on the basis that—like Pluto—Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Neptune have not cleared their orbital neighbourhoods either. Earth co-orbits with 10,000 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), and Jupiter has 100,000 Trojan asteroids in its orbital path. "If Neptune had cleared its zone, Pluto wouldn't be there," he now says.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/TheKuiperBelt_75AU_All.svg/400px-TheKuiperBelt_75AU_All.svg.png
