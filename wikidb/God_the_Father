66.5	God_the_Father	God the Father	God the Father is a gendered title given to God in many monotheistic religions, particularly patriarchal, Abrahamic ones. In Judaism, God is called Father because he is the creator, life-giver, law-giver, and protector. In traditional Christianity, God is also called Father because of the Father-Son relationship revealed by Jesus Christ as well as the reasons mentioned above.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Cima_da_Conegliano%2C_God_the_Father.jpg/300px-Cima_da_Conegliano%2C_God_the_Father.jpg
