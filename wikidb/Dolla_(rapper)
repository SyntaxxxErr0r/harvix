20.62	Dolla_(rapper)	Dolla (rapper)	Roderick Anthony Burton II (November 25, 1987 â€“ May 18, 2009) better known by his stage name Dolla, was an American rapper. Burton began his music career in 2000 with rap group Da Razkalz Cru under the stage name Bucklyte. The group quickly disbanded, so Burton worked as a model for the Sean John clothing line. In 2007, Burton signed to Akon's Konvict Muzik label and used the stage name Dolla for his releases. Dolla released three singles from 2007 to 2009. One of them, "Who the Fuck is That?" (featuring Akon &amp; T-Pain), charted on the Billboard Hot 100. On May 18, 2009, Burton was shot to death outside a shopping mall in Los Angeles, and Aubrey Berry was arrested for his murder. Berry was acquitted on all charges.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Dolla.jpg/220px-Dolla.jpg
