172.3	Depth_of_field	Depth of field	In optics, particularly as it relates to film and photography, depth of field (DOF) is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image. Although a lens can precisely focus at only one distance at a time, the decrease in sharpness is gradual on each side of the focused distance, so that within the DOF, the unsharpness is imperceptible under normal viewing conditions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Depth_of_field_diagram.png/440px-Depth_of_field_diagram.png
