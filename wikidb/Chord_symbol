3.30	Chord_symbol	Chord (music)	The English word "chord" derives from Middle English "cord", a shortening of "accord" in the original sense of "agreement" and later "harmonious sound". A sequence of chords is known as a chord progression or harmonic progression. These are frequently used in Western music. A chord progression "aims for a definite goal" of establishing (or contradicting) a tonality founded on a key, root or tonic chord. The study of harmony involves chords and chord progressions, and the principles of connection that govern them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Classical_spectacular07.jpg/300px-Classical_spectacular07.jpg
