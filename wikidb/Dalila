1.10	Dalila	Delilah	Delilah (דלילה – Dlila, Standard Hebrew meaning " weakened or uprooted or impoverished" from the root dal meaning "weak or poor") appears only in the Hebrew bible Book of Judges 16, where she is the "woman in the valley of Sorek" whom Samson loved, and who was his downfall. Her figure, one of several dangerous temptresses in the Hebrew bible, has become emblematic: "Samson loved Delilah, she betrayed him, and, what is worse, she did it for money", Madlyn Kahr begins her study of the Delilah motif in European painting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Samson_and_Delilah_mg_0034.jpg/350px-Samson_and_Delilah_mg_0034.jpg
