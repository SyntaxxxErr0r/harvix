I believe that I and others have reverted their vandalism edits, but please note that only one of the four accounts has been blocked as of this posting. It may be worth keeping an eye on these articles should the same user create additional accounts. --Happy editing! Sincerely, Tally-ho! 02:04, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
