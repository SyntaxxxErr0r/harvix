78.0	Image_processing	Image processing	In electrical engineering and computer science, image processing is any form of signal processing for which the input is an image, such as a photograph or video frame; the output of image processing may be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image. Most image-processing techniques involve treating the image as a two-dimensional signal and applying standard signal-processing techniques to it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Imagen_binaria.jpg/300px-Imagen_binaria.jpg
