94.1	Reconquista	Reconquista	The Reconquista (Spanish: , Portuguese: , Galician: , Catalan: , "Reconquest"; Arabic: â€Ž trans. , , "the Recapturing") was a period of almost 800 years (539 years in Portugal) in the Middle Ages during which several Christian kingdoms succeeded in retaking the Muslim-controlled areas of the Iberian Peninsula broadly known as Al-Andalus. The Reconquista of Al-Andalus began soon after the Islamic conquest with an Asturian rebellion under the leadership of the nobleman Pelagius.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/La_rendici%C3%B3n_de_Granada.jpg/305px-La_rendici%C3%B3n_de_Granada.jpg
