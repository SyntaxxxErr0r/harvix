79.1	Egg_(biology)	Egg (biology)	An egg is an organic vessel in which an embryo first begins to develop. In most birds, reptiles, insects, molluscs, fish, and monotremes, an egg is the zygote, resulting from fertilization of the ovum, which is expelled from the body and permitted to develop outside the body until the developing embryo can survive on its own. The term "egg" is restricted to the animal kingdom, similar reproductive structures in other kingdoms are termed spores, or (in spermatophytes) seeds, see ovum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Oeufs002b.jpg/220px-Oeufs002b.jpg
