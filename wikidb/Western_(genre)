65.5	Western_(genre)	Western (genre)	The Western is a genre of various visual arts, such as film, television, radio, literature, painting and others. Westerns are devoted to telling stories set primarily in the latter half of the 19th century in the American Old West, hence the name. Some Westerns are set as early as the Battle of the Alamo in 1836. There are also a number of films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as Junior Bonner set in the 1970s and The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada in the 21st century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Great_train_robbery_still.jpg/190px-Great_train_robbery_still.jpg
