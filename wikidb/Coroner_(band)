15.41	Coroner_(band)	Coroner (band)	Coroner is a Swiss thrash metal/progressive metal band from Zurich. They garnered relatively little attention outside of Europe. Formed in 1983, the band broke up in 1996, but decided to reform 14 years later. The band performed at multiple live venues and festivals around the world in 2011, and have said that new material is a possibility. Coroner's music combines elements of thrash, progressive rock, jazz, and industrial metal with suitably gruff vocals. With their increasingly complex style of progressive rock-infused thrash, they are often labeled as "the Rush of thrash metal" by music critics. Coroner's sound then progressed and the production became more refined, resulting in the more progressive No More Color, Mental Vortex and Grin albums.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/70/Coroner-band.PNG/220px-Coroner-band.PNG
