52.4	Hudson_River_School	Hudson River School	The Hudson River School was a mid-19th century American art movement embodied by a group of landscape painters whose aesthetic vision was influenced by romanticism. The paintings for which the movement is named depict the Hudson River Valley and the surrounding area, including the Catskill, Adirondack, and the White Mountains; eventually works by the second generation of artists associated with the school expanded to include other locales.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Thomas_Cole%2C_The_Oxbow.jpg/250px-Thomas_Cole%2C_The_Oxbow.jpg
