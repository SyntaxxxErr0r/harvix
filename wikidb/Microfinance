142.3	Microfinance	Microfinance	Microfinance is usually understood to entail the provision of financial services to micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses, which lack access to banking and related services due to the high transaction costs associated with serving these client categories. The two main mechanisms for the delivery of financial services to such clients are (1) relationship-based banking for individual entrepreneurs and small businesses; and (2) group-based models, where several entrepreneurs come together to apply for loans and other services as a group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Community-based_savings_bank_in_Cambodia.jpg/300px-Community-based_savings_bank_in_Cambodia.jpg
