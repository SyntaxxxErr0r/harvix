63.2	Anosmia	Anosmia	Anosmia is a lack of functioning olfaction, or in other words, an inability to perceive odors. Anosmia may be temporary but traumatic anosmia can be permanent. Anosmia is not due to any inflammation of the nasal mucosa; blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe. It can be caused by chronic meningitis and neurosyphilis that would increase intracranial pressure over a long period of time.
