70.4	Cubic_zirconia	Cubic zirconia	Cubic zirconia (or CZ) is the cubic crystalline form of zirconium dioxide (ZrO2). The synthesized material is hard, optically flawless and usually colorless, but may be made in a variety of different colors. It should not be confused with zircon, which is a zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4). It is sometimes erroneously called "cubic zirconium".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CZ_brilliant.jpg
