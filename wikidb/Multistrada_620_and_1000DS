3.00	Multistrada_620_and_1000DS	Ducati Multistrada	The Multistrada is a model of motorcycle introduced by Ducati in 2003. The word Multistrada is Italian for "many roads" as the bike is designed to handle asphalt as well as some unpaved surfaces. Essentially the bike is a hybrid of a supermoto and a sport touring motorcycle. Its upright riding position gives it a stronger appeal for those who like touring but want something lighter than a touring bike. The Multistrada competes in the same niche market as do other multi-purpose and dual-sport motorcycles such as the BMW GS, but even according to the owners manual the Multistrada is not intended for off-road use despite its off-road inspired design, hence Motorcycle Consumer News classifies it as a standard.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Ducati_Multistrada_1000DS_vs_the_1100DS-S.jpg/250px-Ducati_Multistrada_1000DS_vs_the_1100DS-S.jpg
