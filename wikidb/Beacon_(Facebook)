92.6	Beacon_(Facebook)	Facebook Beacon	As part of a class action settlement, Facebook terminated Beacon. Facebook was also required by a court order to notify its users of the settlement. Facebook set up a $6 million fund to establish an independent non-profit foundation that will identify and fund projects and initiatives that promote the cause of online privacy, safety, and security. Facebook also set up a website about the lawsuit, http://www.beaconclasssettlement.com/. Under the contingency fee arrangement with the plaintiffs, the law firms that filed the case would get a fee, likely to be $3â€“$4 million, but the average Facebook user would receive no monetary award. Facebook notified its users about the court order.
