52.7	Progressive_tax	Progressive tax	A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. "Progressive" describes a distribution effect on income or expenditure, referring to the way the rate progresses from low to high, where the average tax rate is less than the marginal tax rate. It can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. Progressive taxes attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower ability-to-pay, as they shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Distribution_of_U.S._Federal_Taxes_2000.JPG/350px-Distribution_of_U.S._Federal_Taxes_2000.JPG
