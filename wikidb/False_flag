173.5	False_flag	False flag	False flag (aka Black Flag) operations are covert operations designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by other entities. The name is derived from the military concept of flying false colors; that is: flying the flag of a country other than oneâ€™s own. False flag operations are not limited to war and counter-insurgency operations and can be used during peace-time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Charlemagne_P%C3%A9ralte.jpg/150px-Charlemagne_P%C3%A9ralte.jpg
