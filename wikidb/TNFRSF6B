3.10	TNFRSF6B	TNFRSF6B	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6B also known as DcR3(Decoy Receptor 3) and M68 was identified in 1998 by the search of genes with homology to the TNFR gene superfamily in expressed sequence tag (EST) database. It is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNFRSF6B gene. The open reading frame of TNFRSF6B encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence and four tandem cystein-rich repeats. Two transcript variants encoding the same isoform, but differing in the 5' UTR, have been observed for this gene. Unlike most of the other members of TNFR superfamily, TNFRSF6 is a soluble protein which contains no transmembrane domain.
