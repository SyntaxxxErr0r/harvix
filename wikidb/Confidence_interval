94.6	Confidence_interval	Confidence interval	In statistics, a confidence interval is a particular kind of interval estimate of a population parameter and is used to indicate the reliability of an estimate. It is an observed interval (i.e. it is calculated from the observations), in principle different from sample to sample, that frequently includes the parameter of interest, if the experiment is repeated. How frequently the observed interval contains the parameter is determined by the confidence level or confidence coefficient.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Confidenceinterval.png/200px-Confidenceinterval.png
