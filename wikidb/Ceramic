81.6	Ceramic	Ceramic	A ceramic is an inorganic, nonmetallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent cooling. Ceramic materials may have a crystalline or partly crystalline structure, or may be amorphous (e.g., a glass). Because most common ceramics are crystalline, the definition of ceramic is often restricted to inorganic crystalline materials, as opposed to the noncrystalline glasses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Blue_and_white_vase_Jingdezhen_Ming_Yongle_1403_1424.jpg/220px-Blue_and_white_vase_Jingdezhen_Ming_Yongle_1403_1424.jpg
