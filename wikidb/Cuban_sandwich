35.32	Cuban_sandwich	Cuban sandwich	A Cuban sandwich is a variation of a ham and cheese originally created in cafes catering to Cuban workers in Cuba and in the early Cuban immigrant communities of Florida: Key West and Ybor City, Tampa. Later on, Cuban exiles and expatriates brought it to Miami where it is also still very popular. The sandwich is made with ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and sometimes salami on Cuban bread.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Cuban_mix.jpg/250px-Cuban_mix.jpg
