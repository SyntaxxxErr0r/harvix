2.01	Thomas_Erskine,_6th_Earl_of_Kellie	Thomas Erskine, 6th Earl of Kellie	Thomas Alexander Erskine, 6th Earl of Kellie (1 September 1732 â€“ 9 October 1781), styled Viscount Fentoun and Lord Pittenweem until 1756, was a British musician and composer whose considerable talent brought him international fame and his rakish habits notoriety, but nowadays is little known. Recent recordings of his surviving compositions have led to him being re-evaluated as one of the most important British composers of the 18th century, as well as a prime example of Scotland's music.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/6thEarlOfKellie.jpg
