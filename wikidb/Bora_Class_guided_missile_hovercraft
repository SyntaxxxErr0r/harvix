Its designation in the Soviet and Russian navies is Project 1239; the first vessel produced under this designation was Sivuch, which was later renamed Bora. It is one of the largest combat sea vehicles with catamaran design.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Bora_Class_Missile_Corvette_Samum.jpg/300px-Bora_Class_Missile_Corvette_Samum.jpg
