65.2	Air_guitar	Air guitar	Playing air guitar is a form of dance and movement in which the performer pretends to play rock or heavy metal-style electric guitar, including riffs, solos, etc. Playing an air guitar usually consists of exaggerated strumming and picking motions and is often coupled with loud singing or lip-synching. Air guitar is generally used in the imaginary simulation of loud electric guitar music.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Airguitar1.jpg/220px-Airguitar1.jpg
