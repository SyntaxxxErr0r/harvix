However, both the French and German films were without the gangsters that are an integral part of the plot of Some Like It Hot. Wilder's working title for his film was Fanfares of Love, then Not Tonight, Josephine before he decided on Some Like It Hot as its release title.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Some_Like_It_Hot_poster.jpg/220px-Some_Like_It_Hot_poster.jpg
