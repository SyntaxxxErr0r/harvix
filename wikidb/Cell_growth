53.9	Cell_growth	Cell growth	Wee1 protein is a tyrosine kinase that normally phosphorylates the Cdc2 cell cycle regulatory protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK1 on a tyrosine residue. Cdk1 drives entry into mitosis by phosphorylating a wide range of targets. This covalent modification of the molecular structure of Cdc2 inhibits the enzymatic activity of Cdc2 and prevents cell division. Wee1 acts to keep Cdk1 inactive during early G2 when cells are still small. When cells have reached sufficient size during G2, the phosphatase Cdc25 removes the inhibitory phosphorylation, and thus activates Cdk1 to allow mitotic entry. A balance of Wee1 and Cdc25 activity with changes in cell size is coordinated by the mitotic entry control system. It has been shown in Wee1 mutants, cells with weakened Wee1 activity, that Cdc2 becomes active when the cell is smaller. Thus, mitosis occurs before the yeast reach their normal size. This suggests that cell division may be regulated in part by dilution of Wee1 protein in cells as they grow larger.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Cellcycle_and_growth.png/220px-Cellcycle_and_growth.png
