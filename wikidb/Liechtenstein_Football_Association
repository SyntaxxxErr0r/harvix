3.00	Liechtenstein_Football_Association	Liechtenstein Football Association	The Liechtenstein Football Association (German: ) is the governing body of football in Liechtenstein. It organizes the Liechtenstein national football team and the Liechtenstein football Cup. Due to the fact that Liechtenstein only has a small number of active teams, it is the only UEFA member without its own national league. This means the Liechtensteiner teams play in the Swiss Football League system. The LFV is based in Vaduz.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/Liechtenstein_football_association.svg/150px-Liechtenstein_football_association.svg.png
