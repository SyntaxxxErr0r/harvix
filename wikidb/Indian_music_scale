1.00	Indian_music_scale	Swara	The seven notes of the scale , in Indian music are named shadja, rishabh, gandhar, madhyam, pancham, dhaivat and nishad, and are shortened to Sa, Ri (Carnatic) or Re (Hindustani), Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, and Ni and written S, R, G, M, P, D, N. Collectively these notes are known as the sargam (the word is an acronym of the consonants of the first four swaras). Sargam is the Indian equivalent to solfege, a technique for the teaching of sight-singing. Sargam is practiced against a drone. The tone Sa is not associated with any particular pitch. As in Western moveable-Do solf√®ge, Sa refers to the tonic of a piece or scale rather than to any particular pitch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Saraswati.jpg/100px-Saraswati.jpg
