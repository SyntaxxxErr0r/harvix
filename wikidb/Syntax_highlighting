69.3	Syntax_highlighting	Syntax highlighting	Syntax highlighting is a feature of some text editors that display text—especially source code—in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature eases writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers and editors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/HTML_source_code_example.svg/315px-HTML_source_code_example.svg.png
