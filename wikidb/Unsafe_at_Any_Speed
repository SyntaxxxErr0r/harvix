59.6	Unsafe_at_Any_Speed	Unsafe at Any Speed	Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile by Ralph Nader, published in 1965, is a book detailing resistance by car manufacturers to the introduction of safety features, like seat belts, and their general reluctance to spend money on improving safety. It was a pioneering work, openly polemical but containing substantial references and material from industry insiders. It made Nader a household name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/Unsafeatanyspeedcover.jpg/130px-Unsafeatanyspeedcover.jpg
