19.01	1948_Winter_Olympics	1948 Winter Olympics	The 1948 Winter Olympics, officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in 1948 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II; it had been 12 years since the last Winter Games in 1936. From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany, the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the Games. The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/1948_Winter_Olympics_emblem.png/150px-1948_Winter_Olympics_emblem.png
