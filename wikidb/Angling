35.26	Angling	Angling	Angling is a method of fishing by means of an "angle" . The hook is usually attached to a fishing line and the line is often attached to a fishing rod. Fishing rods are usually fitted with a fishing reel that functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. The hook itself can be dressed with lures or bait. A bite indicator such as a float is sometimes used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Fishing_off_pier.jpg/300px-Fishing_off_pier.jpg
