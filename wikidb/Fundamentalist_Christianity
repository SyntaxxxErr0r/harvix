56.0	Fundamentalist_Christianity	Christian fundamentalism	Christian fundamentalism, also known as Fundamentalist Christianity, or Fundamentalism, arose out of British and American Protestantism in the late 19th century and early 20th century among evangelical Christians. The founders reacted against liberal theology and militantly asserted that the inerrancy of the Bible was essential for true Christianity and was being violated by the modernists. As an organized movement, it began in the 1920s within Protestant churches — especially Baptist and Presbyterian — in the United States in the early 20th century. Fundementalist Christianty is often intertwined with Biblical literalism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/P_christianity.svg/100px-P_christianity.svg.png
