7.47	Calling_Dr._Love	Calling Dr. Love	"Calling Dr. Love" is a song by the American hard rock band Kiss, originally released on their 1976 album Rock and Roll Over. The song was written by Kiss bassist/lead vocalist Gene Simmons at a Holiday Inn in Evansville, Indiana. It was the second single released from the album, and the group's fourth US Top 20 single, reaching #16 in Billboard. The song's title came from Gene Simmons' recollection of a Three Stooges short called "Men in Black", containing an announcement over a hospital intercom, "Calling Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine, Doctor Howard", meaning Moe, Larry and Curly, respectively. The songs' main riff is very reminiscent of the song "Cold Ethyl" by Alice Cooper, from the 1975 LP, "Welcome To My Nightmare".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/Calling_Dr._Love_-_KISS_-_1979.jpg/220px-Calling_Dr._Love_-_KISS_-_1979.jpg
