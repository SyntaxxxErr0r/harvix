42.08	Curve	Curve	In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a line but which is not required to be straight. This entails that a line is a special case of curve, namely a curve with null curvature. Often curves in two-dimensional or three-dimensional (space curves) Euclidean space are of interest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Parabola.svg/220px-Parabola.svg.png
