54.3	Devil_facial_tumour_disease	Devil facial tumour disease	Devil facial tumour disease is an aggressive non-viral transmissible parasitic cancer—which likely originated in Schwann cells—that affects Tasmanian devils. The first "official case" was described in 1996, in Australia. In the subsequent decade the disease ravaged Tasmania's wild devils, with estimates of decline ranging from 20% to as much as a 50% of the devil population, across over 65% of the state. Affected high-density populations suffer up to 100% mortality in 12–18 months. The disease has mainly been concentrated in Tasmania's eastern half. Visible signs of DFTD begin with lesions and lumps around the mouth. These develop into cancerous tumours that may spread from the face to the entire body. The tumours interfere with feeding, and the affected animal may starve to death. At present the population has dwindled 70% since 1996. Numbers as of 2010 show an 80% rate of infection throughout the population. Six females have been found with a partial immunity. Breeding in captivity has begun to try to save the population. It is spread by devils biting each other's heads when fighting over food.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Tasmanian_Devil_Facial_Tumour_Disease.png/220px-Tasmanian_Devil_Facial_Tumour_Disease.png
