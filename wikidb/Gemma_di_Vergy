It is based on the tragedy Charles VII chez ses grands vassaux (Charles VII at the homes of his great vassals) (1831) by Alexandre Dumas père, which was later to become the subject of the opera The Saracen by the Russian composer César Cui. The heroine is the childless wife of the Count of Vergny, and the plot deals with her jealousy and grief as her husband arranges an annulment of their marriage in preparation for the arrival of his new bride, Ida, and her despair following the murder of her husband by a slave, Tamas, who is secretly in love with her.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Gaetano_Donizetti_1.jpg/220px-Gaetano_Donizetti_1.jpg
