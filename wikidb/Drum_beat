As such a "beat" consists of multiple drum strokes occurring over multiple musical beats while the term "drum beat" may also refer to a single drum stroke which may occupy more or less time than the current pulse. Many drum beats define or are characteristic of specific music genres.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Characteristic_rock_drum_pattern.png/400px-Characteristic_rock_drum_pattern.png
