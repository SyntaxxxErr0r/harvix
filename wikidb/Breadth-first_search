81.1	Breadth-first_search	Breadth-first search	In graph theory, breadth-first search is a graph search algorithm that begins at the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes. Then for each of those nearest nodes, it explores their unexplored neighbor nodes, and so on, until it finds the goal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Breadth-first-tree.svg/300px-Breadth-first-tree.svg.png
