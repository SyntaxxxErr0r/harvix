81.1	Knesset	Knesset	The size of the Knesset, currently at 120 members, has often been a source of cause for proposed reforms. In 1996, then-Justice Minister Yossi Beilin backed the ultimately unsuccessful institution of the so-called "Norwegian law", which would require appointed members of the cabinet to resign their seats in the Knesset and allow other members of their parties to take their positions while they serve in the cabinet; this would have resulted in more active members of the legislature being present in regular sessions and committee meetings. This proposed law has also been favored by other politicians, including Yitzhak Levy (who has backed the raising of total seats to 150) and current prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Emblem_of_Israel_alternative_blue-gold.svg/170px-Emblem_of_Israel_alternative_blue-gold.svg.png
