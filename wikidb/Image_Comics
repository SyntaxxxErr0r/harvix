51.3	Image_Comics	Image Comics	Image Comics is a United States comic book publisher. It was founded in 1992 by high-profile illustrators as a venue where creators could publish their material without giving up the copyrights to the characters they created, as creator-owned properties. It was immediately successful, and remains one of the largest comic book publishers in North America. Its output was originally dominated by work from the studios of the Image partners, but later included work by numerous independent creators. Its best-known series include Spawn, Savage Dragon, Witchblade, The Darkness, Invincible, and The Walking Dead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8d/ImageComicsLogo.gif/100px-ImageComicsLogo.gif
