53.5	Scholasticism	Scholasticism	Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100â€“1500, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending orthodoxy in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of, and a departure from, Christian monastic schools.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg/250px-Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg
