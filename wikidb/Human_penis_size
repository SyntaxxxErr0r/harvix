51.0	Human_penis_size	Human penis size	The average stretched penile length at birth is about 4 cm (1.6 in), and 90% of newborn boys will be between 2.4 and 5.5 cm (0.9 and 2.2 in). Limited growth of the penis occurs between birth and 5 years of age, but very little occurs between 5 years and the onset of puberty. The average size at the beginning of puberty is 6 cm (2.4 in) with adult size reached about 5 years later. W.A. Schonfeld published a penis growth curve in 1943.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Penis_frequency.svg/275px-Penis_frequency.svg.png
