35.68	Hans_Asperger	Hans Asperger	Hans Asperger (February 18, 1906 â€“ October 21, 1980) was an Austrian pediatrician, medical theorist, and medical professor. He is best known for his landmark studies on mental disorders, especially in children, and for redefining the previously accepted diagnosis of autism. Though his work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime, except for a few accolades in Vienna, his studies on psychological disorders became world renown posthumously, and many of his pediatric diagnosis are now accepted standards. After him, the mental disorder Asperger syndrome (AS) was named. He wrote over 300 publications, mostly concerning autism in children.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/Asperger-Vienna-clinic.jpeg/220px-Asperger-Vienna-clinic.jpeg
