3.20	In_the_Sun_(song)	In the Sun (song)	"In the Sun" is the second single from Joseph Arthur's second studio album Come to Where I'm From, though the song had been performed during Joseph's live shows as early as 1996. The single was released in the UK and Europe on April 23, 2001 via Real World Records and Virgin Records. The original singles were very limited in production and are now out of print and hard to find. A music video was produced for the song, directed by Anton Corbijn. The video is featured on the Directors Label series DVD The Work of Director Anton Corbijn.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/Michael_Stipe_-_In_the_Sun.png
