134.1	Neutrino	Neutrino	A neutrino (Italian pronunciation: ) is an electrically neutral, weakly interacting elementary subatomic particle with half-integer spin. The neutrino (meaning "small neutral one" in Italian) is denoted by the Greek letter Î½ . All evidence suggests that neutrinos have mass but that their mass is tiny even by the standards of subatomic particles. Their mass has never been measured accurately.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/FirstNeutrinoEventAnnotated.jpg/280px-FirstNeutrinoEventAnnotated.jpg
