56.1	Shiatsu	Shiatsu	Shiatsu is Japanese for "finger pressure"; it is a type of alternative medicine consisting of finger and palm pressure, stretches, and other massage techniques. There is no scientific evidence proving that shiatsu can treat any disease, but shiatsu practitioners promote it as a way to help people relax and cope with issues such as stress, muscle pain, nausea, anxiety, and depression. There are two main Shiatsu schools: one incorporating elements of western anatomical and physiological theory, and the other based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Shiatsu is traditionally performed on a futon mat, with clients fully clothed.
