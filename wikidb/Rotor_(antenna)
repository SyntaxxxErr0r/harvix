2.00	Rotor_(antenna)	Antenna rotator	An antenna rotator is a device which is used to change the orientation of a directional antenna. Most antenna rotators have two parts, the rotator unit and the controller. The controller is normally placed near the equipment which the antenna is connected to, while the rotator is mounted on the antenna mast directly below the antenna.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Vu2gmn_antenna.jpg/300px-Vu2gmn_antenna.jpg
