2.00	Tai_kwon_do	Taekwondo	Taekwondo is a Korean martial art and the national sport of South Korea. In Korean, tae (태, 跆) means "to strike or break with foot"; kwon (권, 拳) means "to strike or break with fist"; and do (도, 道) means "way", "method", or "path". Thus, taekwondo may be loosely translated as "the way of the hand and the foot." The name taekwondo is also written as taekwon-do, tae kwon-do, or tae kwon do by various organizations, based on historical, philosophical, or political reasons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d4/WTF_Taekwondo_1.jpg/200px-WTF_Taekwondo_1.jpg
