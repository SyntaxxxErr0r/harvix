241.5	Frank_Lloyd_Wright	Frank Lloyd Wright	Frank Lloyd Wright (born Frank Lincoln Wright, June 8, 1867 â€“ April 9, 1959) was an American architect, interior designer, writer and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures and completed 500 works. Wright believed in designing structures which were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by his design for Fallingwater (1935), which has been called "the best all-time work of American architecture". Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_LC-USZ62-36384.jpg/220px-Frank_Lloyd_Wright_LC-USZ62-36384.jpg
