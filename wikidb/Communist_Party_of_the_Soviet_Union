59.4	Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union	Communist Party of the Soviet Union	The Communist Party of the Soviet Union was the constitutional force of societal organisation in the Soviet Union and one of the largest communist organisations in the world. In this, the CPSU was not a political party in the Western sense. In the collapsing USSR, it lost its dominant roll in the wake of the failed August 1991 coup d'Ã©tat attempt led by authoritarian hardliners.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Pin_of_the_Flag_of_CPSU-2.svg/200px-Pin_of_the_Flag_of_CPSU-2.svg.png
