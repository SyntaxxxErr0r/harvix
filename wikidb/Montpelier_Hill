3.10	Montpelier_Hill	Montpelier Hill	Montpelier Hill is a hill, 383 metres (1,257 feet) high in County Dublin, Ireland. It is commonly referred to as the Hell Fire Club (Irish: ), the popular name given to the ruined building at the summit. This building – a hunting lodge built around 1725 by William Conolly – was originally called Mount Pelier and since its construction the hill has also gone by the same name. The original Irish name of the hill is no longer known although the historian and archaeologist Patrick Healy has suggested that the hill is the place known as or in the , the twelfth century diocesan register book of the Archbishops of Dublin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Hell_Fire_Club_Dublin_at_Dawn.jpg/280px-Hell_Fire_Club_Dublin_at_Dawn.jpg
