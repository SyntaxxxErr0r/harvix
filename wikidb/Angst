56.9	Angst	Angst	Angst is a German, English, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Dutch word for fear or anxiety (anguish is its Latinate equivalent, and anxious, anxiety are of similar origin). It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety or inner turmoil. The term Angst distinguishes itself from the word Furcht (German for "fear") in that Furcht is a negative anticipation regarding a concrete threat, while Angst is a (possibly nondirectional) emotion, though the terms are colloquially sometimes used synonymously.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f4/The_Scream.jpg/220px-The_Scream.jpg
