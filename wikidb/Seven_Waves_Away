1.00	Seven_Waves_Away	Seven Waves Away	Seven Waves Away (alternate U.S. titles: Abandon Ship! and Seven Days From Now) is a 1957 British drama film starring Tyrone Power, Mai Zetterling, Lloyd Nolan, and Stephen Boyd. When his ship goes down, an officer has to make an agonizing decision on his overcrowded lifeboat. The plot has similarities to the real-life sinking of the American ship William Brown in 1841. Though there is no direct acknowledgment by the filmmakers, the film ends with a voice-over stating, "The story which you have just seen is a true one. In real life, Captain Alexander Holmes was brought to trial on a charge of murder. He was convicted and given the minimum sentence of six months because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the incident."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Poster_of_the_movie_Seven_Waves_Away.jpg/220px-Poster_of_the_movie_Seven_Waves_Away.jpg
