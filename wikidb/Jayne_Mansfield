67.5	Jayne_Mansfield	Jayne Mansfield	Jayne Mansfield (born Vera Jayne Palmer; April 19, 1933 â€“ June 29, 1967) was an American actress who worked in Hollywood and on Broadway. One of the leading blonde sex symbols of the late-1950s, Mansfield starred in several popular Hollywood films that emphasized her platinum-blonde hair, hourglass figure, and cleavage-revealing costumes. 20th Century Fox signed a six-year contact with Mansfield to replace Marilyn Monroe as their resident blonde sex symbol. Throughout her career, she was compared by the media to Monroe and the other top sex symbol Mamie Van Doren. Mansfield was a Playboy Playmate of the Month and appeared in the magazine on several occasions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Jayne_Mansfield_with_jockeys_in_1957.jpg/220px-Jayne_Mansfield_with_jockeys_in_1957.jpg
