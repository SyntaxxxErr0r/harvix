2.00	SV-328	SV-328	The SV-328 is an 8-bit home computer introduced by Spectravideo in June 1983. It was the business-targeted model of the Spectravideo range, sporting a rather crowded full-travel keyboard with numeric keypad. It had 80 kB RAM (64 kB available for software, remaining 16 kB video memory), a respectable amount for its time. Other than the keyboard and RAM, this machine was identical to its little brother, the SV-318.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/SV328.jpg/300px-SV328.jpg
