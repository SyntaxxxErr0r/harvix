1.00	State_Route_289_(Virginia)	Fairfax County Parkway	The Fairfax County Parkway, signed as State Route 286 , is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. It provides a northâ€“south arterial route in Fairfax County with a mix of interchanges and signalized and unsignalized intersections. Its alignment roughly corresponds to part of the once-proposed Outer Beltway around Washington, D.C. The first segment of the roadway opened in 1987; the road was completed in 2010. In February 2012, SR 286 and SR 289 were transferred to primary roads from their secondary status as SR 7100 and SR 7900.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/04/Ffx_Co._Pkwy_-_Ft._Belvoir_section.jpg/250px-Ffx_Co._Pkwy_-_Ft._Belvoir_section.jpg
