7.02	Alice's_restaurant	Alice's Restaurant	"Alice's Restaurant Massacree" is a musical monologue by singer-songwriter Arlo Guthrie released on his 1967 album Alice's Restaurant. The song is one of Guthrie's most prominent works, based on a true incident in his life that began on Thanksgiving Day 1965, and which inspired a 1969 movie of the same name. Apart from the chorus which begins and ends it, the "song" is in fact a spoken monologue, with a repetitive but catchy ragtime guitar backing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Alice%27s_Restaurant.jpg/220px-Alice%27s_Restaurant.jpg
