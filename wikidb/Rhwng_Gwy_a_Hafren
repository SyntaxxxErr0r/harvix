1.00	Rhwng_Gwy_a_Hafren	Rhwng Gwy a Hafren	Rhwng Gwy a Hafren (English: ) was a region of medieval Wales, located in the Welsh Marches between Powys to the north and Brycheiniog to the south. It was bounded by the rivers Wye and Severn (Hafren), hence its name. It covered approximately the same territory as Radnorshire, now part of the county of Powys. The region first came into its own in the 9th or 10th centuries, when it was ruled by leaders who operated independently of the surrounding kingdoms. After the Norman invasion, it made up the central part of the Welsh Marches and was a frequent site of struggle between the Welsh and Normans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Rhwng.Gwy.a.Hafren.jpg/300px-Rhwng.Gwy.a.Hafren.jpg
