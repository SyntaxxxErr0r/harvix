1.00	Zombie_Live	Zombie Live	Zombie Live is the first live album from heavy metal artist Rob Zombie. The CD was recorded over several nights during the band's "Educated Horses" tour and was said to include a 36-page super-deluxe book of never-before-seen live pictures and a DVD of live footage and animated videos. After the release of the album no artbook or DVD were included with the release of the album. Blabbermouth.net confirmed that the DVD companion would be available in spring 2008. This album was also the first album to be released in the new Recyclable CD cases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d2/Rob_Zombie_-_Zombie_Live.jpg/220px-Rob_Zombie_-_Zombie_Live.jpg
