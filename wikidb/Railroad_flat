1.00	Railroad_flat	Railroad apartment	A railroad apartment is an apartment with a series of rooms connecting to each other in a line. A hallway typically runs the length of the apartment or flat from the front door to the back door, outside each room. This is similar in design to a railway car. This usage is most common in New York City, San Francisco and their surrounding areas. Railroad apartments are common in brownstone apartment buildings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Tenement_of_the_Old_Style.png
