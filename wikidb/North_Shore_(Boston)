2.00	North_Shore_(Boston)	North Shore (Massachusetts)	The North Shore is a region in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, loosely defined as the coastal area between Boston and New Hampshire. The region is made up both of a rocky coastline, dotted with marshes and wetlands, as well as several beaches and natural harbors. The North Shore is an important historical, cultural, and economic region of Massachusetts. It contains the cities of Salem, known world-wide as the site of the Salem Witch Trials; and Gloucester, site of Sebastian Junger's 1997 creative nonfiction book The Perfect Storm and its 2000 film adaptation. Beverly was home to author John Updike until his death. The region also prominently figures in the works of H. P. Lovecraft, notably The Shadow over Innsmouth, as well as those of many New England poets, from T.S. Eliot to Robert Lowell.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/North_Shore_MA.png/350px-North_Shore_MA.png
