1.00	Blast-Attak	List of Masters of the Universe characters	He-Man is "the most powerful man in the universe" and in most media he is the alter-ego of Prince Adam. He is armed with a power harness that enhances his strength, the Sword of Power, and a shield. Early media, such as the minicomics packaged with the original run of action figures, also depicts him wielding a battle ax. He-Man possesses superhuman strength and is capable of performing incredible feats, such as lifting heavy objects such as rocks and buildings, as well as having the advantage over just about any opponent. He is a strong upholder of moral justice and is regarded by the people of Eternia as their greatest hero. In the original minicomics He-Man was a wandering barbarian hailing from a jungle tribe, but the cartoon series He-Man and the Masters of the Universe portrayed him as the alter ego of the young Prince Adam, heir to the throne of Eternia, and most media since have followed suit. Prince Adam is the son of King Randor and Queen Marlena of Eternia, and is viewed by many as fun-loving, lazy and cowardly. This is in fact only an act to stop people from suspecting that he is also He-Man. Prince Adam was given the Sword of Power by The Sorceress of Castle Grayskull, and when he lifts the sword and says "By the Power of Grayskull... I Have the Power!" he is magically transformed into He-Man, defender of Eternia.
