4.32	Sioux_Gateway_Airport	Sioux Gateway Airport	The construction of Sioux City Army Air Base began in March 1942, about three months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Opened on 5 July 1942, it became a major training center during World War II for crew members of B-24 Liberators and B-17 Flying Fortresses. With the end of World War II, the former training base switched to becoming a processing center to discharge personnel out of the service and back into civilian life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Sioux_Gateway_Airport-2006-USGS.jpg/220px-Sioux_Gateway_Airport-2006-USGS.jpg
