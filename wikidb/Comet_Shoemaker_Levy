2.00	Comet_Shoemaker_Levy	Comet Shoemakerâ€“Levy 9	Anticipation grew as the predicted date for the collisions approached, and astronomers trained terrestrial telescopes on Jupiter. Several space observatories did the same, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the ROSAT X-ray observing satellite, and significantly the Galileo spacecraft, then on its way to a rendezvous with Jupiter scheduled for 1995. While the impacts took place on the side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6 AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Jupiter's rapid rotation brought the impact sites into view for terrestrial observers a few minutes after the collisions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Shoemaker-Levy_9_on_1994-05-17.png/300px-Shoemaker-Levy_9_on_1994-05-17.png.jpeg
