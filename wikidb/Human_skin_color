70.1	Human_skin_color	Human skin color	Human skin color is primarily due to the presence of melanin in the skin. Skin color ranges from almost black to white with a pinkish tinge due to blood vessels underneath. Variation in natural skin color is mainly due to genetics, although the evolutionary causes are not completely certain. According to scientific studies, natural human skin color diversity within populations is highest in Sub-Saharan African populations, with skin reflectance values ranging from 19 to 46 (med. 31) compared with European and East Asian populations which have skin reflectance values of 62 to 69 and 50 to 59 respectively. The term "range" is loosely defined in this case, as African albinos have obviously not been taken into consideration when calculating the "range".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Romane_Bohringer_A%C3%AFssa_Maiga.jpg/220px-Romane_Bohringer_A%C3%AFssa_Maiga.jpg
