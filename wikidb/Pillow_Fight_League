3.10	Pillow_Fight_League	Pillow Fight League	The Pillow Fight League (PFL) is a Toronto-based semi-professional sports league centered around public pillow fights. The tongue in cheek women's sport is hosted in a fighting arena, much like a boxing or wrestling match. The League was founded by PFL Commissioner Stacey P. Case, and Honorary PFL Commissioner Craig Daniels in February 2004. The formal league launched at a Canadian goth bar called The Vatikan in downtown Toronto. Events since then have been hosted in both Montreal, Quebec and New York City, but the primary seat of the League remains in Toronto, Ontario. Fighter Abbie Roadkill, originally of British descent, recently speculated about a similar event in the United Kingdom.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Pillowhit.jpg/220px-Pillowhit.jpg
