3.00	DECNET	DECnet	DECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with four layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol.
