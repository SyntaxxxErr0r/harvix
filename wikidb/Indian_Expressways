4.10	Indian_Expressways	Indian Expressways	An expressway is a controlled-access highway; it is a highway that controls entrances to it and exits from it by incorporating the design of the slip roads for entry and exit into the design of the highway itself. Access-control should not be confused with collection of toll. An expressway may be free to use and may not collect toll at all. Expressways are the highest class of roads in the Indian Road Network. These are six or eight lane highways with controlled-access. India has approximately 600 km expressways.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/MumbaiPuneExpressway.jpg/220px-MumbaiPuneExpressway.jpg
