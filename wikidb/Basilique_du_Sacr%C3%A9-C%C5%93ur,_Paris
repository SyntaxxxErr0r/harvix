62.6	Basilique_du_Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris	Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, Paris	The Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris, commonly known as Sacré-Cœur Basilica , is a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica, dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Paris, France. A popular landmark, the basilica is located at the summit of the butte Montmartre, the highest point in the city. Sacré-Cœur is a double monument, political and cultural, both a national penance for the supposed excesses of the Second Empire and socialist Paris Commune of 1871 crowning its most rebellious neighborhood, and an embodiment of conservative moral order, publicly dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which was an increasingly popular vision of a loving and sympathetic Christ.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Le_sacre_coeur_%28paris_-_france%29.jpg/250px-Le_sacre_coeur_%28paris_-_france%29.jpg
