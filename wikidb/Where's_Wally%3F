97.4	Where's_Wally%3F	Where's Wally?	Where's Wally?, published in the United States and Canada as Where's Waldo?, is a series of children's books created by British illustrator Martin Handford. The books consist of a series of detailed double-page spread illustrations depicting dozens or more people doing a variety of amusing things at a given location. Readers are challenged to find a character named Wally hidden in the group. Wally's distinctive red-and-white striped shirt, bobble hat, and glasses make him slightly easier to recognise, but many illustrations contain "red herrings" involving deceptive use of red-and-white striped objects. Later entries in the long-running book series added other targets for readers to find in each illustration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/MartinHandfordWally%26Friends.PNG/250px-MartinHandfordWally%26Friends.PNG
