The purpose of programming is to create a set of instructions that computers use to perform specific operations or to exhibit desired behaviors. The process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/IBM402plugboard.Shrigley.wireside.jpg/220px-IBM402plugboard.Shrigley.wireside.jpg
