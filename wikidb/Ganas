1.32	Ganas	Ganas	Ganas is an intentional community founded in 1979 in Tompkinsville, Staten Island. Ganas has non-egalitarian, tiered membership groups, and is thus a partial member at the Federation of Egalitarian Communities. The community uses a group problem-solving process called "Feedback Learning", which was begun by co-founder Mildred Gordon. The community attracted press attention after a 2006 shooting incident which involved allegations of sexual misconduct and arranged marriages. Originally founded with a group of six people, the community has grown to consist of 10â€“12 core group members plus 60 to 70 members of varying involvement. There are three businesses run by Ganas, including a bookstore-cafe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/135-corson.JPG/200px-135-corson.JPG
