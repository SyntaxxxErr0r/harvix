59.3	Confidentiality	Confidentiality	Confidentiality is an ethical principle associated with several professions (e.g., medicine, law, psychotherapy). In ethics, and (in some places) in law and alternative forms of legal resolution such as mediation, some types of communication between a person and one of these professionals are "privileged" and may not be discussed or divulged to third parties.
