67.1	Spanish_Armada	Spanish Armada	The Armada's appointed commander was the highly experienced Marquis of Santa Cruz, but he died in February 1588 and Medina Sidonia, a high-born courtier with no experience at sea, took his place. The fleet set out with 22 warships of the Spanish Royal Navy and 108 converted merchant vessels, with the intention of sailing through the English Channel to anchor off the coast of Flanders, where the Duke of Parma's army of tercios would stand ready for an invasion of the south east of England.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Invincible_Armada.jpg/300px-Invincible_Armada.jpg
