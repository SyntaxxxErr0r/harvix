96.6	Nazi_concentration_camps	Nazi concentration camps	Nazi Germany maintained concentration camps (in German Konzentrationslager, or KZ) throughout the territories it controlled. The first Nazi concentration camps set up in Germany were greatly expanded after the Reichstag fire of 1933, and were intended to hold political prisoners and opponents of the regime. The term was borrowed from the British concentration camps of the Second Anglo-Boer War.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/NaziConcentrationCamp.gif/375px-NaziConcentrationCamp.gif
