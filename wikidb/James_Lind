37.33	James_Lind	James Lind	James Lind FRSE FRCPE (4 October 1716 in Edinburgh â€“ 13 July 1794 in Gosport) was a Scottish physician. He was a pioneer of naval hygiene in the Royal Navy. By conducting the first ever clinical trial, he developed the theory that citrus fruits cured scurvy. He argued for the health benefits of better ventilation aboard naval ships, the improved cleanliness of sailors' bodies, clothing and bedding, and below-deck fumigation with sulphur and arsenic. He also proposed that fresh water could be obtained by distilling sea water. His work advanced the practice of preventive medicine and improved nutrition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/James_lind.jpg/220px-James_lind.jpg
