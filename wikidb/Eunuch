64.6	Eunuch	Eunuch	A eunuch (Greek: ) is a person who (by the common definition of the term eunuch) may have been castrated, typically early enough in his life for this change to have major hormonal consequences. Less commonly, in translations of ancient texts, "eunuch" may refer to a man who is not castrated but who is impotent, celibate or otherwise not inclined to marry and reproduce.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/1749_eunuch.jpg/220px-1749_eunuch.jpg
