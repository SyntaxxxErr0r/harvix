1.01	BN66	BN66	Budget Note 66 is the mechanism by which the UK Government introduced Clause 55 of the Finance Bill 2008, which would later become Section 58 of the UK Finance Act 2008. This specifically targeted Tax Avoidance schemes that made use of Offshore Trusts and Double Taxation Treaties to reduce the Tax paid by the scheme's users. These schemes were heavily marketed to the freelance community after the introduction of Intermediary Regulation 35 or IR35, as they appeared to offer more certainty concerning tax liabilities than would be the case if running a Ltd company. In introducing S58 the Government retrospectively changed the law so that not only could these schemes not operate in future but they were effectively made unlawful from the day they were first introduced.
