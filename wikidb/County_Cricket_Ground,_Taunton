1.10	County_Cricket_Ground,_Taunton	County Ground, Taunton	The County Ground is a cricket ground in Taunton, Somerset. It is the home of Somerset County Cricket Club, who have played there since 1882. The ground, which is located between Priory Bridge Road and St. James Street in Taunton has a capacity in excess of 6,500. The ground was originally built as part of a sports centre by Taunton Athletic Club in 1881, and became the home of the previously nomadic Somerset County Cricket Club soon after. After leasing the ground for ten years, the club bought the ground in 1896, under the guidance of club secretary Henry Murray-Anderdon. The ground ends are the River End to the north and the Old Pavilion End to the south.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/County_ground_taunton_churches.jpg/275px-County_ground_taunton_churches.jpg
