73.0	Chewbacca_defense	Chewbacca defense	The Chewbacca defense is a legal strategy used in episode 27 of South Park, "Chef Aid", which premiered on October 7, 1998, as the fourteenth episode of the second season. The aim of the argument is deliberately to confuse the jury by making use of the fallacy known as ignoratio elenchi, or a red herring. The concept satirised attorney Johnnie Cochran's closing argument defending O. J. Simpson in his murder trial. The Associated Press noted the satire as an example of Cochran's position in popular culture. The concept has become a minor Internet phenomenon, used frequently as a running gag on satirical sites and in forums as a form of rhetoric.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/08/0330chewbacca.jpg/200px-0330chewbacca.jpg
