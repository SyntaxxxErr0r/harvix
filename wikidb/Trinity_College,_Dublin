59.3	Trinity_College,_Dublin	Trinity College, Dublin	Trinity College, Dublin (Irish: ), formally known as the College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth near Dublin, was founded in 1592 by letters patent from Queen Elizabeth I as the "mother of a university".Note 1 It is the sole constituent college of the University of Dublin, unlike the universities of Oxford and of Cambridge after which it was modelled and both of which comprise many constituent colleges. Thus the designations "Trinity College, Dublin" and "University of Dublin" are usually synonymous for practical purposes. Trinity College is one of the seven ancient universities of Britain and Ireland. It is Ireland's oldest university.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Trinity_College_Dublin_Arms.svg/180px-Trinity_College_Dublin_Arms.svg.png
