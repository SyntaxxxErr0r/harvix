156.9	Ludwig_Wittgenstein	Ludwig Wittgenstein	Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein (26 April 1889 â€“ 29 April 1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. He was professor in philosophy at the University of Cambridge from 1939 until 1947. In his lifetime he published just one book review, one article, a children's dictionary, and the 75-page Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921). In 1999 his posthumously published Philosophical Investigations (1953) was ranked as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "...the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations". Bertrand Russell described him as "the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived, passionate, profound, intense, and dominating".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Ludwig_Wittgenstein_by_Ben_Richards.jpg/260px-Ludwig_Wittgenstein_by_Ben_Richards.jpg
