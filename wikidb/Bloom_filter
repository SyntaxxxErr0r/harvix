89.9	Bloom_filter	Bloom filter	A Bloom filter, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positives are possible, but false negatives are not; i.e. a query returns either "inside set (may be wrong)" or "definitely not in set". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a counting filter). The more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Bloom_filter.svg/360px-Bloom_filter.svg.png
