Bräunerhof is most known for being the famous author Thomas Bernhard's preferred café. Today there is a vitrine showing a picture of the author and pointing the direction to the café on a street corner nearby. Every Saturday there is live music at the café with a small orchestra playing waltzes and classical music.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Cafe_Braunerhof.JPG/220px-Cafe_Braunerhof.JPG
