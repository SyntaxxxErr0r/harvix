3.10	Immunization_(finance)	Immunization (finance)	A more practical alternative immunization method is duration matching. Here, the duration of the assets is matched with the duration of the liabilities. Alternatively, the first derivative of the asset's price function with respect to the interest rate, is matched with the liabilities. To make the match more profitable, the assets and liabilities are arranged so that the convexities of the assets exceed the convexity of the liabilities; alternatively, the second derivative of the assets is set to exceed the second derivative of the liabilities.
