1.00	Water_plant	Aquatic plant	Aquatic plants are plants that have adapted to living in aquatic environments (saltwater or freshwater). They are also referred to as hydrophytes or aquatic macrophytes. These plants require special adaptations for living submerged in water, or at the water's surface. Aquatic plants can only grow in water or in soil that is permanently saturated with water. Aquatic vascular plants can be ferns or angiosperms (from a variety of families, including monocots and dicots). Seaweeds are not vascular plants; rather they are multicellular marine algae, and therefore are not typically included among aquatic plants. As opposed to plant types such as mesophytes and xerophytes, hydrophytes do not have a problem retaining water, due to the abundance of water in their environment. This means that aquatic plants have less need to regulate transpiration, which would require more energy and be of little benefit to the plant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Nymphaea_alba.jpg/220px-Nymphaea_alba.jpg
