1.31	Fatty_Knees_(dinghy)	Fatty Knees (dinghy)	The Fatty Knees fibreglass sailing dinghies were designed by Lyle Hess (1912–2002). Produced in 7’ (2.1m), 8’ (2.4m) and 9’ (2.7m) long models. The 8’ model has a 4’ (1.2m) beam. Primarily designed as a yacht tender with good rowing and towing characteristics, the boat can be sailed, with enough width in the beam to provide stability. The hull has a lapstrake appearance. The thwarts and dagger-board trunk are fiberglass inserts glassed into the hull and are watertight. It is cat rigged with a Bermuda mainsail. A transom notch allows sculling. Equipped with oarlocks for rowing. A small outboard motor can be mounted to starboard. Sailing gear is designed to be stored inside the hull. About 2000 dinghies have been produced.
