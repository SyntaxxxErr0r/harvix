303.9	Kabbalah	Kabbalah	Kabbalah, also spelled Kabala or Cabala (Hebrew: â€Ž literally "receiving"), is an esoteric method, discipline and school of thought. Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious Ein Sof (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). While it is heavily used by some denominations, it is not a religious denomination in and of itself; it is a set of scriptures that exist outside the traditional canon of any organised religion. Kabbalah seeks to define the nature of the universe and the human being, the nature and purpose of existence, and various other ontological questions. It also presents methods to aid understanding of these concepts and to thereby attain spiritual realisation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Tree_of_life_kircher_hebrew.png/115px-Tree_of_life_kircher_hebrew.png
