136.8	Credit_default_swap	Credit default swap	A credit default swap is a financial swap agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer in the event of a loan default or other credit event. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS "fee" or "spread") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/CDS-nodefault.PNG/300px-CDS-nodefault.PNG
