84.0	Disk_partitioning	Disk partitioning	Disk partitioning is the act of dividing a hard disk drive into multiple logical storage units referred to as partitions, to treat one physical disk drive as if it were multiple disks. Partitions are also termed "slices" for operating systems based on BSD, Solaris or GNU Hurd. A partition editor software program can be used to create, resize, delete, and manipulate these partitions on the hard disk.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/GParted.png/300px-GParted.png
