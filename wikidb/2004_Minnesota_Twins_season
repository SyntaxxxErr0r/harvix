The team was able to do this in spite of several new players and the absence of three former all-stars. Closer Eddie Guardado, set-up man LaTroy Hawkins, starter Eric Milton, and catcher A.J. Pierzynski had all been dealt prior to the beginning of the season, while first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz was traded midway through the season. The season had both highs – such as Johan Santana winning the Cy Young Award – and lows, such as highly anticipated rookie catcher Joe Mauer injuring his knee and playing for only 35 games. Unfortunately, for the second year in a row, the team was not able to carry its regular season success into the postseason. The New York Yankees eliminated the Twins for the second year in a row in four games in the 2004 American League Division Series.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Santana1.jpg/250px-Santana1.jpg
