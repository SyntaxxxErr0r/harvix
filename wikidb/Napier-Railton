It was driven by Cobb, mainly at Brooklands race track where it holds the all-time lap record (143.44 mph (230.84 km/h)) which was set in 1935 and now stands in perpetuity since the track fell into disuse during the Second World War.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Napier-Railton_at_Brooklands.jpg/220px-Napier-Railton_at_Brooklands.jpg
