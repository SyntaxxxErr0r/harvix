6.20	Killington_Peak	Killington Peak	Killington Peak is the second highest summit in the Green Mountains and in the U.S. state of Vermont. It is located east of Rutland in south-central Vermont. A ski resort, Killington Ski Resort, nicknamed "the beast of the east," is located on the mountain. Killington is a stop on the Long Trail, which here shares its route with the Appalachian Trail. Traveling southbound on the Trail, it is the last 4,000 feet (1,200 m) peak until Virginia. A gondola transports skiers and non-hikers to the summit, which is complete with a restaurant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Killington_Pk_seen_from_Pico_Pk.jpg/280px-Killington_Pk_seen_from_Pico_Pk.jpg
