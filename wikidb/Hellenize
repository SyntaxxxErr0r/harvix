3.00	Hellenize	Hellenization	Hellenization (or Hellenisation) is a term used to describe the spread of ancient Greek culture, and, to a lesser extent, language, over foreign peoples conquered by Greece or in its sphere of influence. It is mainly used to describe the spread of Hellenistic civilization during the Hellenistic period following the campaigns of Alexander the Great of Macedon. The result of Hellenization was that elements of Greek origin combined in various forms and degrees with local elements, which is known as Hellenism. In modern times, Hellenization has been associated with the adoption of modern Greek culture and the ethnic and cultural homogenization of Greece.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/MacedonEmpire.jpg/400px-MacedonEmpire.jpg
