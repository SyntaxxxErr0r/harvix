6.02	Intergalactic_travel	Intergalactic travel	Intergalactic travel is space travel between galaxies. Due to the relatively enormous distances between our own galaxy and even its closest neighbors, any such venture would be far more technologically demanding than even interstellar travel. In comparison, intergalactic distances are roughly one-million fold (six orders of magnitude) greater than their interstellar counterparts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Starsinthesky.jpg/250px-Starsinthesky.jpg
