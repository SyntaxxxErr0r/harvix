10.10	Owl_pellet	Pellet (ornithology)	A pellet, in ornithology, is the mass of undigested parts of a bird's food that some bird species occasionally regurgitate. The contents of a bird's pellet depend on its diet, but can include the exoskeletons of insects, indigestible plant matter, bones, fur, feathers, bills, claws, and teeth. In falconry, the pellet is called a casting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Shituan.jpg/220px-Shituan.jpg
