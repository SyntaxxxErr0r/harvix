82.3	Binomial_distribution	Binomial distribution	In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent yes/no experiments, each of which yields success with probability p. Such a success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli experiment or Bernoulli trial; when n = 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. The binomial distribution is the basis for the popular binomial test of statistical significance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Binomial_distribution_pmf.svg/300px-Binomial_distribution_pmf.svg.png
