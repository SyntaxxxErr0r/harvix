7.31	2-8-2	2-8-2	Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 2-8-2 represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle (usually in a leading truck), eight powered and coupled driving wheels on four axles, and two trailing wheels on one axle (usually in a trailing truck). This configuration of steam locomotive is most often referred to as a Mikado (frequently shortened to Mike), but it is also referred to as a MacArthur. The 2-8-2 was particularly popular in North America, but was also used in continental Europe and elsewhere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/X28.jpg/300px-X28.jpg
