8.21	Pico-Union,_Los_Angeles	Pico-Union, Los Angeles	Pico-Union is a district in Los Angeles, California. Its name derives from the intersection of Pico Boulevard and Union Avenue. The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) officially adopted the name in 1970, when it launched a neighborhood renewal program that continues to this day. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the area became a major point of entry for Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants seeking refuge from civil war, according to the Pico Union Self-Guided Walking Tour, published in 2009 by the Los Angeles Conservancy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/Picounionstreetscene.jpg/280px-Picounionstreetscene.jpg
