2.00	Foshay_tower	Foshay Tower	The Foshay Tower, now the W Minneapolis â€“ The Foshay hotel, is a skyscraper in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Modeled after the Washington Monument, the building was completed in 1929, months before the stock market crash in October of that year. It has 32 floors and stands 447 feet (136 m) high, plus an antenna mast that extends the total height of the structure to 607 feet (185 m). The building, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, is an example of Art Deco architecture. Its address is 821 Marquette Avenue, although it is set well back from the street and is actually closer to 9th Street than Marquette.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/051907-016-FoshayTower.jpg/250px-051907-016-FoshayTower.jpg
