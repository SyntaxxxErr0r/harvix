55.7	Weather_forecasting	Weather forecasting	Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Day5pressureforecast.gif/250px-Day5pressureforecast.gif
