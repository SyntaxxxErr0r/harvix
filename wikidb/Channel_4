137.8	Channel_4	Channel 4	Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster which began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly-owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public body established in 1990, coming into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became an entirely UK-wide TV channel for the first time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c0/Channel_4_New_Logo.svg/150px-Channel_4_New_Logo.svg.png
