69.4	Cross_processing	Cross processing	Cross processing (sometimes abbreviated to Xpro) is the procedure of deliberately processing photographic film in a chemical solution intended for a different type of film. The effect was discovered independently by many different photographers often by mistake in the days of C-22 and E-4. The process is seen most often in fashion advertising and band photography, and in more recent years has become associated with the Lo-fi photography movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Supermodels.jpg/250px-Supermodels.jpg
