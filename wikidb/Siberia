89.9	Siberia	Siberia	Encompassing much of the Eurasian Steppe, the territory of Siberia extends eastward from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between the Pacific and Arctic drainage basins, and southward from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and the national borders of Mongolia and China. Siberia makes up about 77% of Russia's territory (13.1 million square kilometres), but has only 28% (40 million people) of Russia's population.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Siberia-FederalSubjects.png/300px-Siberia-FederalSubjects.png
