54.9	Trotskyism	Trotskyism	Trotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by Leon Trotsky. Trotsky considered himself an orthodox Marxist and Bolshevik-Leninist, which included his support for the establishment of a vanguard party of the working-class. His politics differed sharply from those of Stalinism, most prominently in opposing Socialism in One Country, which he argued was a break with proletarian internationalism, and in his belief in what he argued was a more authentic dictatorship of the proletariat based on working-class self-emancipation and mass democracy, rather than the unaccountable bureaucracy he saw as having developed after Lenin's death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Trotskyist_Left_Opposition-1927.jpg/222px-Trotskyist_Left_Opposition-1927.jpg
