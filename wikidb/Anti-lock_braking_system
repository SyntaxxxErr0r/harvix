65.5	Anti-lock_braking_system	Anti-lock braking system	An anti-lock braking system (ABS, from German: ) is a safety system that allows the wheels on a motor vehicle to continue interacting tractively with the road surface as directed by driver steering inputs while braking, preventing the wheels from locking up (that is, ceasing rotation) and therefore avoiding skidding.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Absbrakes.jpg/220px-Absbrakes.jpg
