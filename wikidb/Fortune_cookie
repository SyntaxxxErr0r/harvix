55.4	Fortune_cookie	Fortune cookie	A fortune cookie is a crisp cookie usually made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and oil with a "fortune" wrapped inside. A "fortune" is a piece of paper with words of wisdom or a vague prophecy. The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers, some of which have become actual winner numbers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Fortune_cookie.jpg/200px-Fortune_cookie.jpg
