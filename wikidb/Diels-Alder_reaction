6.23	Diels-Alder_reaction	Diels–Alder reaction	The Diels–Alder reaction is an organic chemical reaction (specifically, a cycloaddition) between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene, commonly termed the dienophile, to form a substituted cyclohexene system. The reaction can proceed even if some of the atoms in the newly formed ring are not carbon. Some of the Diels–Alder reactions are reversible; the decomposition reaction of the cyclic system is then called the retro-Diels–Alder. For example, retro-Diels–Alder compounds are commonly observed when a Diels–Alder product is analyzed via mass spectrometry.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Diels-alder_%281%2C3-butadiene_-_Ethylene%29.png
