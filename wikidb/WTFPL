52.8	WTFPL	WTFPL	The WTFPL is an infrequently used, extremely permissive free software license. The original Version 1.0 license, released March 2000, was written by Banlu Kemiyatorn who used it for Window Maker artwork. Samuel "Sam" Hocevar, a French programmer who was the Debian project leader from 17 April 2007 to 16 April 2008, wrote version 2.0. It allows for redistribution and modification of the software under any termsâ€”licensees are encouraged to "do what the fuck want to". The license was approved as a GPL-compatible free software license by the Free Software Foundation.
