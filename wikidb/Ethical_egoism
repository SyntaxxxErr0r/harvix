52.9	Ethical_egoism	Ethical egoism	Ethical egoism (also called simply egoism) is the normative ethical position that moral agents ought to do what is in their own self-interest. It differs from psychological egoism, which claims that people can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from rational egoism, which holds merely that it is rational to act in one's self-interest. Contractual egoism acknowledges the interdependence of self-interests through voluntary, freely chosen exchanges. These doctrines may, though, be combined with ethical egoism.
