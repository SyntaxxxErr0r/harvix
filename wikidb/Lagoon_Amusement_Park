It has nine roller coasters, three of which are unique; one of these being Colossus the Fire Dragon, which is the only Schwarzkopf Double Looping coaster still in operation (Laser at Dorney Park closed at the end of the 2008 season). Another is the park's largest and fastest coaster, Wicked (2007). It was designed by Lagoon's engineering department and Werner Stengel in cooperation with Zierer, a ride manufacturer. The third one is BomBora, the newest family coaster.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/47/LagoonAmusementParkLogo.png
