4.00	Fakauvea	Wallisian language	Wallisian or Uvean is the Polynesian language spoken on Wallis Island (also known as Uvea). The language is also known as East Uvean to distinguish it from the related West Uvean spoken on the outlier island of Ouv√©a (near New Caledonia). Wallisian tradition holds that the latter island was colonised from Wallis Island in ancient times.
