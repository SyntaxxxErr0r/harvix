8.20	Jennet	Jennet	A Jennet or Spanish Jennet was a small Spanish horse. It was noted for a smooth naturally ambling gait, compact and well-muscled build, and a good disposition. The jennet was an ideal light riding horse, and as such spread across Europe and provided some of the foundation bloodstock for several horse breeds in the Americas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Jennet.jpg/220px-Jennet.jpg
