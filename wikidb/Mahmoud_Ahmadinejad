187.5	Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad	Mahmoud Ahmadinejad	Ahmadinejad is a controversial figure both within Iran and internationally. He has been criticized domestically for his economic lapses and disregard for human rights. He launched a gas rationing plan in 2007 to reduce the country's fuel consumption, and cut the interest rates that private and public banking facilities could charge. He supports Iran's nuclear energy program. His election to a second term in 2009 was widely disputed and caused widespread protests domestically and drew significant international criticism. In 2011 the presence of a so-called "deviant current" among his aides and supporters led to the arrest of several of them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_%28Brazil_2009%29.jpg/220px-Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_%28Brazil_2009%29.jpg
