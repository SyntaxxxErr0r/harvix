1.00	Skye_Wexler	List of secondary doctors in ER	Donald Anspaugh was first introduced on the show in 1996, during season three. The character was appointed County General's new Chief of Staff after South Side closed and merged with County. In his early appearances, Anspaugh was portrayed as a by-the-book doctor. In season four it is revealed that his son Scott (portrayed by Trevor Morgan) has B-cell lymphoma. The cancer had previously gone into remission but has come back. Scott wants to give up and it is only through a personal connection with Jeanie Boulet in the ER that his spirits are raised. Noticing how well Boulet and his son relate, Anspaugh asks Jeanie to be his son's part time private care giver. She agrees and a deep friendship develops between Scott and Jeanie. Scott eventually dies.
