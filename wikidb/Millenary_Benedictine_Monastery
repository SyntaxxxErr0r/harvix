2.00	Millenary_Benedictine_Monastery	Pannonhalma Archabbey	The Benedictine Pannonhalma Archabbey (Territorial Abbey of Pannonhalma, Latin: ) is the most notable landmark in Pannonhalma and one of the oldest historical monuments in Hungary, founded in the year 996. It is located near the town, on top of a hill (282 m). Saint Martin of Tours is believed to have been born at the foot of this hill, hence its former name, Mount of Saint Martin (Hungarian: ), from which the monastery occasionally took the alternative name of Márton-hegyi Apátság. This is the second largest territorial (i.e., approx. sovereign) abbey in the world, after the one in Monte Cassino.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Pannonhalma_-_Benc%C3%A9s_ap%C3%A1ts%C3%A1g.jpg/300px-Pannonhalma_-_Benc%C3%A9s_ap%C3%A1ts%C3%A1g.jpg
