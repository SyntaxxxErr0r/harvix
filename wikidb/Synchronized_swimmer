1.00	Synchronized_swimmer	Synchronized swimming	Synchronized swimming (often abbreviated to Synchro) is a hybrid form of swimming, dance and gymnastics, consisting of swimmers (either solos, duets, trios, or teams) performing a synchronized routine of elaborate moves in the water, accompanied by music. Synchronized swimming demands advanced water skills, and requires great strength, endurance, flexibility, grace, artistry and precise timing, as well as exceptional breath control when upside down underwater.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Synchronized_swimming_-_Russian_team.jpg/250px-Synchronized_swimming_-_Russian_team.jpg
