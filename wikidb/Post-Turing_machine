7.30	Post-Turing_machine	Post–Turing machine	The table represents just a single Turing "instruction", but we see that it consists of two lines of 5-tuples, one for the case "tape symbol under head = 1", the other for the case "tape symbol under head = 0". Turing observed (Undecidable, p. 119) that the left-two columns – "m-configuration" and "symbol" – represent the machine's current "configuration" – its state including both Tape and Table at that instant – and the last three columns are its subsequent "behavior". As the machine cannot be in two "states" at once, the machine must "branch" to either one configuration or the other:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/State_diagram_2_state_busy_beaver_2_.JPG/900px-State_diagram_2_state_busy_beaver_2_.JPG
