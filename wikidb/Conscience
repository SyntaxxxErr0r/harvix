72.6	Conscience	Conscience	Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or judgment of the intellect that distinguishes right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience is often described as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_022.jpg/220px-Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_022.jpg
