26.86	Pinball_Number_Count	Pinball Number Count	Pinball Number Count (or Pinball Countdown) is a collective title referring to 11 one-minute animated segments on the popular PBS children's series Sesame Street that teach children to count to 12 by following the journey of a pinball through a rather fanciful pinball machine. These segments are notable for the colorful, imaginative animation as well as the funky "one, two, three, FOUR, five...." soundtrack provided by The Pointer Sisters. Pinball Number Count was originally produced in 1976 by Imagination, Inc. in San Francisco, California for the Children's Television Workshop. It made its debut on Sesame Street in 1977.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Pinball6.JPG/220px-Pinball6.JPG
