1.00	She-Oak	Casuarinaceae	Casuarinaceae is a family of dicotyledonous flowering plants placed in the order Fagales, consisting of 3 or 4 genera and approximately 70 species of trees and shrubs native to the Old World tropics (Indo-Malaysia), Australia, and the Pacific Islands. At one time, all of the species were placed in the genus Casuarina, but these were split in 1982 into the genera Allocasuarina, Casuarina, Ceuthostoma, and Gymnostoma. Somewhat controversial at the time, the monophyly of these genera was later supported in a 2003 molecular study of the family. In the Wettstein system, this family was the only one placed in the order Verticillatae. Likewise, in the Engler, Cronquist and Kubitzki systems, Casuarinaceae was the only family placed in the order Casuarinales.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Equisetoid_twigs.jpg/220px-Equisetoid_twigs.jpg
