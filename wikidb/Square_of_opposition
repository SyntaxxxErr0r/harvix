15.84	Square_of_opposition	Square of opposition	In the system of Aristotelian logic, the square of opposition is a diagram representing the different ways in which each of the four propositions of the system are logically related ('opposed') to each of the others. The system is also useful in the analysis of syllogistic logic, serving to identify the allowed logical conversions from one type to another.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Square_of_opposition%2C_set_diagrams.svg/220px-Square_of_opposition%2C_set_diagrams.svg.png
