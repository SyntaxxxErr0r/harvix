The pile is generally either made from wool or a manmade fibre such as polypropylene, nylon or polyester and usually consists of twisted tufts which are often heat-treated to maintain their structure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Azeri_carpet_%28Sirvan_group%29.jpg/220px-Azeri_carpet_%28Sirvan_group%29.jpg
