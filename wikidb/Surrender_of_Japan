51.5	Surrender_of_Japan	Surrender of Japan	The surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945 brought the hostilities of World War II to a close. By the end of July 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy was incapable of conducting operations and an Allied invasion of Japan was imminent. While publicly stating their intent to fight on to the bitter end, Japan's leaders at the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War (the "Big Six") were privately making entreaties to the neutral Soviet Union, to mediate peace on terms favorable to the Japanese. The Soviets, meanwhile, were preparing to attack the Japanese, in fulfillment of their promises to the United States and the United Kingdom made at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Shigemitsu-signs-surrender.jpg/300px-Shigemitsu-signs-surrender.jpg
