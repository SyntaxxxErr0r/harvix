66.0	Fluorescence	Fluorescence	Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. It is a form of luminescence. In most cases, emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. However, when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense, it is possible for one electron to absorb two photons; this two-photon absorption can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation. The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation, termed "resonance fluorescence".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Fluorescent_minerals_hg.jpg/300px-Fluorescent_minerals_hg.jpg
