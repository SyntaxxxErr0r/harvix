84.8	Biomimicry	Biomimicry	Biomorphic mineralization is a technique that produces materials with morphologies and structures resembling those of natural living organisms by using bio-structures as templates for mineralization. Compared to other methods of material production, biomorphic mineralization is facile, environmentally benign and economic Biomorphic mineralization makes efficient use of natural and abundant materials such as calcium, iron, carbon, phosphorus, and silicon with the capability of turning biomass wastes into useful materials. Templates derived from biological nanoparticles such as DNA, viruses, bacteria, and peptides can transform unordered inorganic nanoparticles into complex inorganic nanostructures. Biologically derived nanostructures are typically fabricated using either chemical or physical techniques. Typical chemical fabrication techniques are plasma spraying, plasma immersion ion implantation &amp; deposition (PIII&amp;D), solâ€“gel, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), cold spraying, self-assembly, and so on, whereas in physical modification techniques include laser etching, shot blasting, physical plating, and physical evaporation and deposition etc. Methods of fabrication with high throughput, minimal environmental damage, and low costs are highly sought after.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/TobaccoMosaicVirus.jpg/220px-TobaccoMosaicVirus.jpg
