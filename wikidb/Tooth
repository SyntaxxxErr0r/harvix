72.9	Tooth	Tooth	Teeth (singular tooth) are small, calcified, whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to break down food. Some animals, particularly carnivores, also use teeth for hunting or for defensive purposes. The roots of teeth are covered by gums. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Close_up_-_chimpanzee_teeth.png/200px-Close_up_-_chimpanzee_teeth.png
