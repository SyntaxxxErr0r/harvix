132.6	Metropolitan_area	Metropolitan area	The term metropolitan area refers to a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metropolitan area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, cities, exurbs, counties, and even states. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Urban_sprawl_as_seen_from_Tokyo_tower_towards_West.jpg/300px-Urban_sprawl_as_seen_from_Tokyo_tower_towards_West.jpg
