6.00	Transient_receptor_potential	Transient receptor potential channel	Transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) are a group of ion channels located mostly on the plasma membrane of numerous human and animal cell types. There are about 28 TRP channels that share some structural similarity to each other. These are grouped into two broad groups: group 1 includes, TRPC ( "C" for canonical), TRPV ("V" for vanilloid), TRPM ("M" for melastatin), TRPN and TRPA. In group 2 there are TRPP ("P" for polycystic) and TRPML ("ML" for mucolipin). Many of these channels mediate a variety of sensations like the sensations of pain, hotness, warmth or coldness, different kinds of tastes, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels are thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and used in animals to sense hot or cold. Some TRP channels are activated by molecules found in spices like garlic , chilli pepper (capsaicin), wasabi (allyl isothiocyanate); others are activated by menthol, camphor, peppermint, and cooling agents; yet others are activated by molecules found in marijuana (i.e. THC, CBD and CBN). Some act as sensors of osmotic pressure, volume, stretch, and vibration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2e/TRP_P.Americana_retina.jpg/300px-TRP_P.Americana_retina.jpg
