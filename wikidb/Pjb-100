1.00	Pjb-100	Personal Jukebox	The Personal Jukebox (also known as PJB-100 or Music Compressor) was the first commercially sold hard disk digital audio player. Introduced late in 1999, it preceded the Apple iPod and similar players. The original design was developed by Compaq Research (SRC and PAAD groups) starting in May 1998. Compaq did not release the player themselves, but licensed the design to HanGo Electronics Co., Ltd. of South Korea.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/HanGo_PJB100_Personal_Jukebox.jpg/200px-HanGo_PJB100_Personal_Jukebox.jpg
