1.00	Satisfaction_of_legacies	Satisfaction of legacies	Satisfaction of legacies is a common law doctrine that affects the disposition of property under a will. Under the doctrine, any gift that the maker of the will (the testator) gives during his lifetime to a named beneficiary of the will is presumptively treated as a satisfaction of that beneficiary's inheritance. After the death of the testator, the amount of the gift would then be deducted from the amount that the beneficiary would otherwise have received, even if it operates to entirely cancel out the inheritance. The presumption applies only when the gift is made after the will has already been executed.
