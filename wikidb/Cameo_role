13.24	Cameo_role	Cameo appearance	A cameo role or cameo appearance (often shortened to just cameo; English pronunciation: ) is a brief appearance of a known person in a work of the performing arts, such as plays, films, video games and television, often appearing as themselves. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake), or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes, musicians or even characters from other fictional works are common. A cameo appearance can also include when a crew member of the show or movie plays a minor role. A cameo should not be confused with a guest appearance, being different in that guest appearances do acknowledge the person in question for who they are, be it by explicitly naming them or in the work's credits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Notorious_Hitchcock_cameo_part_6.png/260px-Notorious_Hitchcock_cameo_part_6.png
