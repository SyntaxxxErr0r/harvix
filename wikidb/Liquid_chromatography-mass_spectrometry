18.30	Liquid_chromatography-mass_spectrometry	Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry	Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry is an analytical chemistry technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography (or HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry. LC-MS is a powerful technique used for many applications which has very high sensitivity and selectivity. Generally its application is oriented towards the general detection and potential identification of chemicals in the presence of other chemicals (in a complex mixture). The limitations of LC-MS in urine analysis drug screening is that it often fails to distinguish between specific metabolites, in particular with hydrocodone and its metabolites. LC-MS urine analysis testing is used to detect specific categories of drugs. However, gas chromatography (GC-MS) should be used when detection of a specific drug and its metabolites is required.
