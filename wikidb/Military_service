77.8	Military_service	Military service	Military service, in its simplest sense, is service by an individual or group in an army or other militia, whether as a chosen job or as a result of an involuntary draft . Some nations (e.g., Mexico) require a specific amount of military service from every citizen (except for special cases, such as physical or mental disorders or religious beliefs). A nation with a fully volunteer military does not normally require mandatory military service from its citizens, unless it is faced with a recruitment crisis during a time of war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg/500px-Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg.png
