13.30	Fusee_(horology)	Fusee (horology)	The origin of the fusee is not known. Many sources erroneously credit Jacob Zech of Prague with inventing it around 1525, but it actually appeared with the first spring driven clocks in the 15th century. The idea probably did not originate with clockmakers, since the earliest known example is in a crossbow windlass shown in a 1405 military manuscript. Drawings from the 15th century by Filippo Brunelleschi and Leonardo da Vinci (left) show fusees. The earliest existing clock with a fusee, also the earliest spring-powered clock, is the Burgunderuhr (Burgundy clock), a chamber clock whose iconography suggests that it was made for Phillipe the Good, Duke of Burgundy about 1430, now in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum The earliest definitely dated fusee clock was made by Zech in 1525. The word fusee comes from the French fus√©e and late Latin fusata, 'spindle full of thread'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Fusee_With_Cord.png/230px-Fusee_With_Cord.png
