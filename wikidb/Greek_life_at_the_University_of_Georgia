2.00	Greek_life_at_the_University_of_Georgia	Greek life at the University of Georgia	Greek Life at the University of Georgia comprises more than three dozen active chapters of social fraternities and sororities. While most of the groups are chapters of national organizations, including members of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, National Panhellenic Conference and National Pan-Hellenic Council, independent groups and those with other affiliations also exist. The Greek Life Office was located in Memorial Hall for many years but moved to the Tate Student Center in late 2008 as a result of the expansion to the Tate Center.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ce/Ugaarch.svg/200px-Ugaarch.svg.png
