72.5	Herzog_&_de_Meuron	Herzog &amp; de Meuron	Herzog &amp; de Meuron Architekten, BSA/SIA/ETH is a Swiss architecture firm, founded and headquartered in Basel, Switzerland in 1978. The careers of founders and senior partners Jacques Herzog (born 19 April 1950), and Pierre de Meuron (born 8 May 1950), closely paralleled one another, with both attending the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zürich. They are perhaps best known for their conversion of the giant Bankside Power Station in London to the new home of the Tate Modern. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron have been visiting professors at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design since 1994 and professors at ETH Zürich since 1999.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AllianzArenaSunset.jpg/220px-AllianzArenaSunset.jpg
