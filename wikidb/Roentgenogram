4.00	Roentgenogram	Radiology	Radiology is a medical specialty that employs the use of imaging to both diagnose and treat disease visualised within the human body. Radiologists use an array of imaging technologies (such as x-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose or treat diseases. Interventional radiology is the performance of (usually minimally invasive) medical procedures with the guidance of imaging technologies. The acquisition of medical imaging is usually carried out by the radiographer or radiologic technologist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Radiologist_in_San_Diego_CA_2010.jpg/220px-Radiologist_in_San_Diego_CA_2010.jpg
