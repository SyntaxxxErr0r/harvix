89.6	Katamari_Damacy	Katamari Damacy	Katamari Damacy (塊魂 Katamari Damashii, which roughly translates to clump soul) is a third-person puzzle-action video game that is developed and published by Namco for the PlayStation 2 video game console. It was first released in Japan, and then later in South Korea and North America. The game resulted from a school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory, and was developed for less than $1 million. In designing Katamari Damacy, the development team aimed to maintain four key points: novelty, ease of understanding, enjoyment, and humor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/aa/KatamariDamacybox.jpg/250px-KatamariDamacybox.jpg
