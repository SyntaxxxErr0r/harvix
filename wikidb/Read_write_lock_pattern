2.21	Read_write_lock_pattern	Readersâ€“writer lock	In computer science, a readers-writer or shared-exclusive lock (also known as the multiple readers / single-writer lock or the multi-reader lock, or by typographical variants such as readers/writers lock) is a synchronization primitive that solves one of the readers-writers problems. A readers-writer lock is like a mutex, in that it controls access to a shared resource, allowing concurrent access to multiple threads for reading but restricting access to a single thread for writes (or other changes) to the resource. A common use might be to control access to a data structure in memory that can't be updated atomically but isn't valid (and shouldn't be read by another thread) until the update is complete.
