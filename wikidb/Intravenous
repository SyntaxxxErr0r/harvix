53.8	Intravenous	Intravenous therapy	Intravenous therapy or IV therapy is the infusion of liquid substances directly into a vein. The word intravenous simply means "within a vein". Therapies administered intravenously are often called specialty pharmaceuticals. It is commonly referred to as a drip because many systems of administration employ a drip chamber, which prevents air from entering the blood stream , and allows an estimation of flow rate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Infuuszakjes.jpg/250px-Infuuszakjes.jpg
