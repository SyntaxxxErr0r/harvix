70.1	Asclepius	Asclepius	Asclepius (Greek: Asklēpiós ; Latin Aesculapius) is the god of medicine and healing in ancient Greek religion. Asclepius represents the healing aspect of the medical arts; his daughters are Hygieia ("Hygiene", the goddess/personification of health, cleanliness, and sanitation), Iaso (the goddess of recuperation from illness), Aceso (the goddess of the healing process), Aglæa/Ægle (the goddess of beauty, splendor, glory, magnificence, and adornment), and Panacea (the goddess of universal remedy). He was associated with the Roman/Etruscan god Vediovis. He was one of Apollo's sons, sharing with Apollo the epithet Paean ("the Healer"). The rod of Asclepius, a snake-entwined staff, remains a symbol of medicine today.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Statue_of_Asklepios_NAMA_263_%28DerHexer%29.JPG/200px-Statue_of_Asklepios_NAMA_263_%28DerHexer%29.JPG
