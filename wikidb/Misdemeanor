65.4	Misdemeanor	Misdemeanor	A misdemeanor (also spelled misdemeanour) is a "lesser" criminal act in many common law legal systems. Misdemeanors are generally punished much less severely than felonies, but theoretically more so than administrative infractions (also known as minor, petty or summary offences) and regulatory offences. Many misdemeanors are punished with monetary fines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Graffiti_in_Bucharest%2C_July_2007.jpg/272px-Graffiti_in_Bucharest%2C_July_2007.jpg
