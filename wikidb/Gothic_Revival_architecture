Its popularity grew rapidly in the early nineteenth century, when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval forms, in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Neo-Gothic001.jpg/250px-Neo-Gothic001.jpg
