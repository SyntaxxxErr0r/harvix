79.4	Thermal_insulation	Thermal insulation	Thermal insulation is the reduction of heat transfer between objects in thermal contact or in range of radiative influence. Heat transfer is the transfer of thermal energy between objects of differing temperature. The means to stem heat flow may be especially engineered methods or processes, as well as suitable static objects and materials.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Huygens_thermal_multilayer_insulation.jpg/250px-Huygens_thermal_multilayer_insulation.jpg
