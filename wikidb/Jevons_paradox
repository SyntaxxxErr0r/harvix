164.8	Jevons_paradox	Jevons paradox	In economics, the Jevons paradox (sometimes Jevons effect) is the proposition that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, tends to increase (rather than decrease) the rate of consumption of that resource. In 1865, the English economist William Stanley Jevons observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries. He argued that, contrary to common intuition, technological improvements could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/CottonopolisCropped.jpg/280px-CottonopolisCropped.jpg
