4.60	Paris_aire_urbaine	Paris aire urbaine	The Paris aire urbaine (or "metropolitan area") is a statistical area that describes the reach of commuter movement to and from Paris and its surrounding urban area. The aire urbaine, a statistical area created by France's INSEE economy and census institution to describe suburban development around centres of urban growth, is composed of a couronne périurbaine (commuter belt) surrounding a more densely-constructed and densely-populated unité urbaine (or "urban area"). At present the Paris aire urbaine, with its 14,549 km², extends slightly beyond Paris' administrative Île-de-France administrative region, or "Paris Region".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Paris_uu_ua_jms.png/350px-Paris_uu_ua_jms.png
