15.41	Bass_instrument_amplification	Bass instrument amplification	Bass instrument amplification, used for the bass guitar, double bass and similar instruments, is distinct from other types of amplification systems due to the particular challenges associated with low-frequency sound reproduction. This distinction affects the design of the loudspeakers, the speaker cabinet and the preamplifier and amplifier. Speaker cabinets for bass instrument amplification usually incorporate larger (or more) loudspeakers than the those used for the amplification of other instruments. The loudspeakers themselves must also be sturdier to handle the higher power levels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Bassstack.jpg
