71.5	Gluten-free_diet	Gluten-free diet	A gluten-free diet is a diet that excludes foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat (including kamut and spelt), barley, rye, malts and triticale. It is used as a food additive in the form of a flavoring, stabilizing or thickening agent, often as "dextrin". A gluten-free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for celiac disease, the related condition dermatitis herpetiformis, and wheat allergy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Chenopodium_quinoa0.jpg/250px-Chenopodium_quinoa0.jpg
