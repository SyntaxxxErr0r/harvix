4.20	Thomas_Buford	Thomas Buford	Personalism has been described as "a philosophical perspective for which the person is the ontological ultimate and for which personality is the fundamental explanatory principle," and as "most fundamentally . . . a philosophy committed to the primacy of person-al (subject-related) categories of value and meaning, to the mutual respect of all beings in a reality experienced as a community of persons who are convinced that subject-related categories are subjectival, not subjective in the sense of being private and arbitrary." For personalists, in short, the world of persons is the starting point and end of all philosophy. For a while, Boston Personalism played a major role in American thought. Martin Luther King, Jr., for example, writes in his book Stride Toward Freedom (1958) that the personal idealism of his teachers at Boston University "remains today my basic philosophic position," giving him, among other things, a "metaphysical basis for the dignity and worth of all human personality." In working to ground personalism, Bowne was influenced especially by Kant. As Bowne's first main successor, Brightman put Hegel in the place where Bowne had put Kant in personalist philosophy. Bertocci leaned perhaps most heavily on clinical psychotheory, and Buford draws particularly on the thought of the Neapolitan philosopher Giambattista Vico (1668-1744).
