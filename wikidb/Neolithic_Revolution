65.1	Neolithic_Revolution	Neolithic Revolution	The Neolithic Revolution was the first agricultural revolution. It was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to agriculture and settlement. Archaeological data indicates that various forms of plants and animal domestication evolved independently in six separate locations worldwide circa 10,000–7000 years BP (8,000–5,000 BC). The earliest known evidence exists in the tropical and subtropical areas of southwestern/southern Asia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Centres_of_origin_and_spread_of_agriculture.svg/440px-Centres_of_origin_and_spread_of_agriculture.svg.png
