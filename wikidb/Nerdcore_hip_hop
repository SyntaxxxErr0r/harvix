80.7	Nerdcore_hip_hop	Nerdcore hip hop	Nerdcore hip hop, is a sub-genre of hip hop music characterized by themes and subject matter considered to be of general interest to nerds, though it can appeal to others as well. Self-described nerdcore musician MC Frontalot has the earliest known recorded use of the term in the 2000 song "Nerdcore Hiphop". Frontalot, like most nerdcore artists, self-publishes his work and has released much of it for free online. As a niche genre, nerdcore generally holds to the DIY ethic, and has a history of self-publishing and self-production.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Frontalot.jpg/220px-Frontalot.jpg
