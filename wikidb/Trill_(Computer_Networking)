1.00	Trill_(Computer_Networking)	TRILL (computing)	TRILL (Transparent Interconnect of Lots of Links) is a IETF Standard implemented by devices called RBridges or Routing Bridges. TRILL combines the advantages of bridges and routers and is the application of link state routing to the VLAN-aware customer-bridging problem. RBridges are compatible with and can incrementally replace previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges. They are also compatible with IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are invisible to current IP routers and, like routers, RBridges terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol.
