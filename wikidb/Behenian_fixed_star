10.01	Behenian_fixed_star	Behenian fixed star	The Behenian fixed stars are a selection of fifteen stars considered especially useful for magical applications in the medieval astrology of Europe and the Arab world. Their name derives from Arabic bahman, "root," as each was considered a source of astrological power for one or more planets. Each is also connected with a gemstone and plant that would be used in rituals meant to draw the star's influence . When a planet was within six degrees of an associated star, this influence was thought to be particularly strong.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Astrological_Chart_-_New_Millennium.JPG/134px-Astrological_Chart_-_New_Millennium.JPG
