3.10	Switch_(sexuality)	Top, bottom and versatile	A top is a person who engages in the penetrative role in sexual intercourse with his penis during anal sex and oral sex. Top is also used as a verb meaning "to penetrate another." Top may also describe a broader personal identity involving dominance in a romantic and/or sexual relationship; however, this stipulation is not a requisite element of being a top.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Wiki-anal_missionary.png/250px-Wiki-anal_missionary.png
