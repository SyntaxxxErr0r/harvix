Prior to this, the closest entity to a government was the Hudson's Bay Company, mainly through Dr. John McLoughlin at Fort Vancouver in present day Vancouver, Washington. There were a series of meetings over three years held at Champoeg on the French Prairie along the Willamette River in present day Marion County, Oregon, beginning in 1841.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/OregonInstitute.jpg/220px-OregonInstitute.jpg
