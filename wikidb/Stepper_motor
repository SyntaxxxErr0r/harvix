51.9	Stepper_motor	Stepper motor	A stepper motor (or step motor) is a brushless DC electric motor that can divide a full rotation into a large number of steps. The motor's position can be controlled precisely without any feedback mechanism (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/StepperMotor.gif/200px-StepperMotor.gif
