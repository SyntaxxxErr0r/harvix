12.21	Sicels	Sicels	Modern linguistic studies have determined that the Sicels spoke an Indo-European language and occupied eastern Sicily as well as southern Italy whereas the Sicani (Greek: Sikanoi) and Elymi (Greek Elymoi) inhabited central and western Sicily. It is likely that the two latter peoples spoke non-Indo-European languages, although this is not quite certain, particularly with regard to the Elymian language, which some would consider related to Ligurian or to Anatolian. The common assumption is that the Sicels were the more recent arrivals; they introduced the use of iron into Bronze Age Sicily and brought the domesticated horse. Their arrival on the island has been tentatively in the first half of the first millennium BCE The Sicel necropolis of Pantalica, near Syracuse is the best known, but a Sicel necropolis has also been found at Noto; their elite tombs "a forno" or "oven-shaped" take the form of beehives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Tribes_of_Sicily_by_11th_century_BC.png/250px-Tribes_of_Sicily_by_11th_century_BC.png
