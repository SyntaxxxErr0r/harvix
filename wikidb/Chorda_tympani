4.20	Chorda_tympani	Chorda tympani	The chorda tympani is a nerve that branches from the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) inside the facial canal, just before the facial nerve exits the skull via the Stylomastoid foramen. It serves the taste buds in the front of the tongue, runs through the middle ear, and carries taste messages to the brain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Gray912.png/250px-Gray912.png
