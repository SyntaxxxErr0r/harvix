77.4	Endoscopy	Endoscopy	Endoscopy means looking inside and typically refers to looking inside the body for medical reasons using an endoscope , an instrument used to examine the interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the body. Unlike most other medical imaging devices, endoscopes are inserted directly into the organ. Endoscopy can also refer to using a borescope in technical situations where direct line of-sight observation is not feasible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Flexibles_Endoskop.jpg/230px-Flexibles_Endoskop.jpg
