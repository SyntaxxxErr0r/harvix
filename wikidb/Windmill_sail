One example of a mill with annular sails was at Feltwell, Norfolk. Others are known to have existed at Haverhill, Suffolk, Boxford, Suffolk and Roxwell, Essex. Annular sails were also employed on large wind engines, such as the Titt engine at Crux Easton, Hampshire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Sobreiro.jpg/120px-Sobreiro.jpg
