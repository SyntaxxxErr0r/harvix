53.1	Low-carbohydrate_diet	Low-carbohydrate diet	As with the Paleolithic diet, several advocates of low-carbohydrate diets have argued that they are closer to the ancestral diet of humans before the invention of agriculture, and therefore that humans are genetically adapted to diets low in carbohydrate. Direct archaeological or fossil evidence on nutrition during the Paleolithic era, when all humans subsisted by hunting and gathering, is limited, but suggests that humans evolved from the vegetarian diets common to other great apes to one with a greater level of meat eating. Some close relatives of modern Homo sapiens, such as the Neanderthals, appear to have been almost exclusively carnivorous. A more detailed picture of early human diets before the invention of agriculture may be obtained by analogy to contemporary hunter-gatherers. According to one survey of these societies, a relatively low carbohydrate (22â€“40% of total energy), animal food-centered diet is preferred "whenever and wherever it ecologically possible", and where plant foods do predominate carbohydrate consumption remains low because wild plants are much lower in carbohydrate and higher in fiber than modern domesticated crops.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/No-carb_pork.jpg/220px-No-carb_pork.jpg
