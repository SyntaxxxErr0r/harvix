His assassination in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused the Central Powers (including Germany and Austria-Hungary) and the Allies of World War I (countries allied with Serbia) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria_Signature.svg/125px-Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria_Signature.svg.png
