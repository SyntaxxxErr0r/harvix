61.6	Narcolepsy	Narcolepsy	Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder, or dyssomnia, characterized by excessive sleepiness and sleep attacks at inappropriate times, such as while at work. People with narcolepsy often experience disturbed nocturnal sleep and an abnormal daytime sleep pattern, which often is confused with insomnia. Narcoleptics, when falling asleep, generally experience the REM stage of sleep within 5 minutes; whereas most people do not experience REM sleep until an hour or so later.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/1R02_crystallography.png/220px-1R02_crystallography.png
