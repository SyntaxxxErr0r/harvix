2.30	Scrub_Jay	Aphelocoma	The passerine birds of the genus Aphelocoma include the scrub jays and relatives. They are New World jays found in Mexico, western Central America and the western United States, with an outlying population in Florida. This genus belongs to the group of New World (or "blue") jays–possibly a distinct subfamily–which is not closely related to other jays, magpies or treepies (Ericson et al., 2005 ). They live in open pine-oak forests, chaparral, and mixed evergreen forests.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/WesternScrubJay2.jpg/275px-WesternScrubJay2.jpg
