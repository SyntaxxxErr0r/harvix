58.9	Armistice_with_Germany_(Compi%C3%A8gne)	Armistice with Germany	The armistice between the Allies and Germany was an agreement that ended the fighting in the First World War. It went into effect at 11 am on November 11, 1918, and marked a victory for the Allies and a complete defeat for Germany, although not technically a surrender. The Germans were responding to the policies proposed by American President Woodrow Wilson in his Fourteen Points. The actual terms, largely written by French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, included the cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of German troops to behind their own borders, the preservation of infrastructure, the exchange of prisoners, a promise of reparations, the disposition of German warships and submarines, and conditions for prolonging or terminating the armistice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Armisticetrain_%28slight_crop%29.jpg/220px-Armisticetrain_%28slight_crop%29.jpg
