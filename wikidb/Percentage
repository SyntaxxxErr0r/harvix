54.1	Percentage	Percentage	In mathematics, a percentage is a way of expressing a number, especially a ratio, as a fraction of 100. The word is derived from the Latin per centum meaning “by the hundred”. It is often denoted using the percent sign, “%”, or the abbreviation “pct.” For example, 45% (read as “forty-five percent”) is equal to 45/100, or 0.45. A related system which expresses a number as a fraction of 1000 uses the terms "per mil" and "millage".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Percent_18e.svg/100px-Percent_18e.svg.png
