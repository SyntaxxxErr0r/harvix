51.3	Pink_noise	Pink noise	Pink noise or 1/Æ’ noise (sometimes also called flicker noise) is a signal or process with a frequency spectrum such that the power spectral density (energy or power per Hz) is inversely proportional to the frequency. In pink noise, each octave carries an equal amount of noise power. The name arises from the pink appearance of visible light with this power spectrum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Pink_noise_spectrum.png/220px-Pink_noise_spectrum.png
