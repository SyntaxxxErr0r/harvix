7.60	Un-Break_My_Heart	Un-Break My Heart	"Un-Break My Heart" is a song by American recording artist Toni Braxton, taken from her second studio album, Secrets (1996). The R&amp;B ballad was written by Diane Warren, who conceived its lyrics after thinking on the song title. Braxton expressed a dislike for the song; however, Clive Davis was able to convince the singer to record it and include on her album. It was then released as the second single from the album in July 10, 1996, through LaFace Records. Lyrically, the song alludes to a "blistering heartbreak" in which Braxton begs a former lover to return and undo the pain he has caused. "Un-Break My Heart" received mixed reviews from music critics; however, it won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1997.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/ToniBraxtonUnBreakMyHeartCDSingleCover.jpg/220px-ToniBraxtonUnBreakMyHeartCDSingleCover.jpg
