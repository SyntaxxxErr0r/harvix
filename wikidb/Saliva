84.0	Saliva	Saliva	Saliva (English pronunciation: ), referred to in various contexts as spit, spittle, drivel, drool, or slobber, is the watery substance produced in the mouths of humans and most animals. Saliva is a component of oral fluid. In mammals, saliva is produced in and secreted from the three pairs of major salivary glands: the parotid, sublingual, and submandibular glands. Hundreds of other minor salivary glands also contribute to the production of saliva. Human saliva is composed of 98% water, while the other 2% consists of electrolytes, mucus, glycoproteins, enzymes, and antibacterial compounds such as secretory IgA and lysozyme. The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats. These enzymes also play a role in breaking down food particles entrapped within dental crevices, protecting teeth from bacterial decay. Furthermore, saliva serves a lubricative function, wetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing, and protecting the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity from desiccation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/OakDoNotSpitOnFloor.jpg/225px-OakDoNotSpitOnFloor.jpg
