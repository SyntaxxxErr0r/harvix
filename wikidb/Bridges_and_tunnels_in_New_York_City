Over 2,000 of them provide uninterrupted vehicular movement throughout the region. Several agencies claim jurisdiction over this network of crossings including the New York City Department of Transportation, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), New York State Department of Transportation, New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Amtrak and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/NYCSub_JMZ_Williamsburg_2.jpg/220px-NYCSub_JMZ_Williamsburg_2.jpg
