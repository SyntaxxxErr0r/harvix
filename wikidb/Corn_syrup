65.9	Corn_syrup	Corn syrup	Corn syrup is a food syrup, which is made from the starch of maize and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade. Corn syrup is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is created when corn syrup undergoes enzymatic processing, producing a sweeter compound that contains higher levels of fructose.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Corn_syrup.jpg/300px-Corn_syrup.jpg
