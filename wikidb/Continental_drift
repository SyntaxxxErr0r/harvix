61.0	Continental_drift	Continental drift	Continental Drift is the movement of the Earth's continents relative to each other. The hypothesis that continents 'drift' was first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596 and was fully developed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. In the 1960s the theory of plate tectonics incorporated and improved upon continental drift: the Earth's surface seems to be broken into about ten major tectonic plates moving as the sea floor spreads, with the continents frozen into them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Antonio_Snider-Pellegrini_Opening_of_the_Atlantic.jpg/300px-Antonio_Snider-Pellegrini_Opening_of_the_Atlantic.jpg
