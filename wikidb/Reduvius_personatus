3.00	Reduvius_personatus	Masked hunter	The masked hunter is an insect, belonging to the assassin bug (Reduviidae) family. The name refers to the fact that its nymph camouflages itself with dust. The masked hunter is a predator of small arthropods, including woodlice, lacewings, earwigs, and bed bugs. Although they do not feed on human blood, masked hunters can bite humans in self-defence when mishandled. The bite can be very painful, but masked hunters do not transmit any diseases and medical attention is rarely needed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Reduvius_personatus01.jpg/240px-Reduvius_personatus01.jpg
