63.4	Exegesis	Exegesis	Exegesis (from the Greek from 'to lead out') is a critical explanation or interpretation of a text, especially a religious text. Traditionally the term was used primarily for exegesis of the Bible; however, in contemporary usage it has broadened to mean a critical explanation of any text, and the term "Biblical exegesis" is used for greater specificity. The goal of Biblical exegesis is to explore the meaning of the text which then leads to discovering its significance or relevance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Paloma.png
