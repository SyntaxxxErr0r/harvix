161.0	Chupacabra	Chupacabra	The chupacabras (Spanish pronunciation: , from chupar "to suck" and cabra "goat", literally "goat sucker") is a legendary cryptid rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas. It is associated more recently with sightings of an allegedly unknown animal in Puerto Rico (where these sightings were first reported), Mexico, and the United States, especially in the latter's Latin American communities. The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Chupacabras.JPG/220px-Chupacabras.JPG
