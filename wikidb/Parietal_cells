3.00	Parietal_cells	Parietal cell	Parietal cells, or oxyntic cells, are the stomach epithelium cells that secrete gastric acid and intrinsic factor in response to histamine , acetylcholine (M3 receptors) and gastrin (CCK2 receptors). The histamine receptors act by increasing intracellular cAMP, whereas the muscarinic and gastrin receptors increase intracellular Ca2+ levels. Both cAMP and Ca2+ act via protein kinases to increase the transport of acid into the stomach. Gastrin is more important indirectly by increasing histamine synthesis in ECL cells, as gastrin has no effect on the maximum histamin-stimulated gastric acid secretion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Parietal_cells.jpg/250px-Parietal_cells.jpg
