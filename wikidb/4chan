262.6	4chan	4chan	4chan is an English-language imageboard website. Launched on October 1, 2003, its boards were originally used for the posting of pictures and discussion of manga and anime. Users generally post anonymously and the site has been linked to Internet subcultures and activism, most notably Project Chanology. 4chan users have been responsible for the formation or popularization of Internet memes such as lolcats, Rickrolling, "Chocolate Rain", Pedobear, and many others. The site's "Random" board is by far its most popular and notorious feature. Known as "/b/", there are minimal rules on posted content. Gawker once jokingly claimed that "reading /b/ will melt your brain".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/4chan_front_page_2010.png/280px-4chan_front_page_2010.png
