77.8	Radiation_therapy	Radiation therapy	Radiation therapy (in American English), radiation oncology, or radiotherapy (in the UK, Canada and Australia), sometimes abbreviated to XRT or DXT, is the medical use of ionizing radiation, generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of curative therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotheraphy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Radiation_therapy.jpg/220px-Radiation_therapy.jpg
