15.14	Landfall_(meteorology)	Landfall (meteorology)	Landfall is the event of a tropical cyclone (also known as a hurricane) or a waterspout coming onto land after being over water. When a waterspout makes landfall it is reclassified as a tornado, which can then cause damage inland. When a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it quickly dissipates as it loses the inflow of warm air into the vortex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Charley_Landfall.gif/245px-Charley_Landfall.gif
