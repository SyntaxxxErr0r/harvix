82.6	Lettuce	Lettuce	Lettuce is a temperate annual or biennial plant of the sunflower family Asteraceae. It is most often grown as a leaf vegetable, but also sometimes for its stem. First grown by the Egyptians, it then spread to the Greeks and Romans, who gave it the name "lactuca", from which the modern "lettuce" ultimately derives. By 50 AD, multiple types were described, and it appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th century saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century varieties were being described that can still be found in gardens in the 21st century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Iceberg_lettuce_in_SB.jpg/220px-Iceberg_lettuce_in_SB.jpg
