The name is derived from its situation in a jarrah forest. Established in the late 1800s as the state's first major timber milling operation, it played a key role in the development of Western Australia through the exportation of jarrah around the world. At the 2006 census, Jarrahdale had a population of 599. Since 2001, the historic precinct has been managed by the state's National Trust organisation alongside private residential and tourism-oriented developments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Jarrahdale_SMC_2007.jpg/270px-Jarrahdale_SMC_2007.jpg
