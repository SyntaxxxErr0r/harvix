81.0	Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale	Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale	The Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS), or the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS), classifies hurricanes — Western Hemisphere tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical storms — into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds. To be classified as a hurricane, a tropical cyclone must have maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph (33 m/s; 64 kn; 119 km/h) (Category 1). The highest classification in the scale, Category 5, is reserved for storms with winds exceeding 156 mph (70 m/s; 136 kn; 251 km/h).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Hurricane_Lester_22_aug_1992_2246Z.jpg/140px-Hurricane_Lester_22_aug_1992_2246Z.jpg
