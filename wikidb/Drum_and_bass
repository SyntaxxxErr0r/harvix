89.8	Drum_and_bass	Drum and bass	Drum and bass (also written as drum 'n' bass and commonly abbreviated to D&amp;B, D+B or DnB) is a type of electronic music which emerged in the mid 1990s. The genre is characterized by fast breakbeats (typically between 160â€“180 bpm, occasional variation is noted in older compositions), with heavy bass and sub-bass lines. Drum and bass began as an offshoot of the United Kingdom rave scene of the very early 1990s. Over the first decade of its existence, the incorporation of elements from various musical genres led to many permutations in its overall style.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Goldie_2003.jpg/160px-Goldie_2003.jpg
