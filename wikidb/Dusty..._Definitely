4.10	Dusty..._Definitely	Dusty... Definitely	Dusty... Definitely is the ninth studio album by singer Dusty Springfield, recorded and released in the UK in 1968. Production credits go to both John Franz, and for the first time, Springfield herself. The songs on this album were chosen because Springfield "liked them", as stated in the liner notes. Like the vast majority of her LPs, the album shows a diverse range of styles ranging from soul ("Take Another Little Piece of my Heart"), pop ("This Girl's in Love With You"), folk ("Morning (Bom Dia)") to lounge ("Who (Will Take my Place?").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Dusty..._Definitely.jpg/220px-Dusty..._Definitely.jpg
