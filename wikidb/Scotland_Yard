62.4	Scotland_Yard	Scotland Yard	Scotland Yard is a metonym for the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Service of the British capital, London. It derives from the location of the original Metropolitan Police headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place, which had a rear entrance on a street called Great Scotland Yard. The Scotland Yard entrance became the public entrance to the police station. Over time, the street and the Metropolitan Police became synonymous. The New York Times wrote in 1964 that, just as Wall Street gave its name to the New York financial world, Scotland Yard did the same for police activity in London. The Metropolitan Police moved away from Scotland Yard in 1890, and the name "New Scotland Yard" was adopted for the new headquarters.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/New_Scotland_Yard_sign_3.jpg/210px-New_Scotland_Yard_sign_3.jpg
