2.00	Voodoo_Graphics	3dfx Interactive	3dfx Interactive was a company that specialized in the manufacturing of 3D graphics processing units and, later, graphics cards. It was a pioneer in the field for several years in the late 1990s until 2000 when it underwent one of the most high-profile demises in the history of the PC industry. It was headquartered in San Jose, California until, on the verge of bankruptcy, many of its intellectual assets (and many employees) were acquired by its rival, Nvidia. 3dfx Interactive filed for bankruptcy on October 15, 2002.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/aa/3dfx_logo.svg/220px-3dfx_logo.svg.png
