3.10	First_and_Third_Trinity_Boat_Club	First and Third Trinity Boat Club	The First and Third Trinity Boat Club is the rowing club of Trinity College in Cambridge, England. The club formally came into existence in 1946 when the First Trinity Boat Club and the Third Trinity Boat Club merged, although the 2 clubs had been rowing together for several years before that date. The first boat club associated with Trinity was formed in 1825 and came to be known as First Trinity in 1833 when the Third Trinity Boat Club was formed (a Second Trinity Boat Club was formed in 1831 but did not have a continuous existence until 1840). Membership of Third Trinity was originally confined to Old Etonians and Old Westminsters. Members of Third Trinity were allowed also to be members of First or Second Trinity and often were.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/First_and_Third_Trinity_Rowing_Blade.svg/250px-First_and_Third_Trinity_Rowing_Blade.svg.png
