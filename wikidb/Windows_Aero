102.2	Windows_Aero	Windows Aero	Windows Aero is the graphical user interface and the default theme in most editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, operating systems released by Microsoft. It is also available in Windows Server 2008, but is not enabled by default. Its name is a backronym for Authentic, Energetic, Reflective and Open. Intended to be a cleaner, more powerful, more efficient and more aesthetically pleasing user interface than the previously used theme , it includes new translucency, live thumbnails, live icons, animations and eye candy. Aero also encompasses a set of user interface design guidelines for Microsoft Windows. In Windows Vista, for performance reasons, brightness is reduced and transparency is disabled when windows are maximized, but in Windows 7, transparency is enabled unless the user disables it in personalization or chooses the basic or classic theme.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Aero.svg/125px-Aero.svg.png
