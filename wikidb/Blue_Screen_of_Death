272.9	Blue_Screen_of_Death	Blue Screen of Death	The Blue Screen of Death (also known as BSoD or Blue Screen), known officially as a Stop Error or a bug check, is the error screen displayed by the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems upon encountering a critical error, of a non-recoverable nature, that causes the system to crash. The term is named after the color of the screen generated by the error. In Unix-based operating systems, a similar term is kernel panic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Windows_XP_Blue_Screen_of_Death_%28PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA%29.svg/220px-Windows_XP_Blue_Screen_of_Death_%28PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA%29.svg.png
