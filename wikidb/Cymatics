60.7	Cymatics	Cymatics	Cymatics (from Greek: "wave") is the study of visible sound and vibration, a subset of modal phenomena. Typically the surface of a plate, diaphragm, or membrane is vibrated, and regions of maximum and minimum displacement are made visible in a thin coating of particles, paste, or liquid. Different patterns emerge in the exitatory medium depending on the geometry of the plate and the driving frequency.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Resonance_Chladni_Soundboard_Harpsichord_Clavecin.jpg/220px-Resonance_Chladni_Soundboard_Harpsichord_Clavecin.jpg
