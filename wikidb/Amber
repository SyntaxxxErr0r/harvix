145.6	Amber	Amber	Amber is fossilized tree resin (not sap), which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times. Amber is used as an ingredient in perfumes, as a healing agent in folk medicine, and as jewelry. There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions. Amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite, and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Amber.pendants.800pix.050203.jpg/220px-Amber.pendants.800pix.050203.jpg
