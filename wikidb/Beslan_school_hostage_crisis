It began when a group of armed separatist militants, mostly Ingush and Chechen, took more than 1,100 people (including 777 children) hostage on 1 September, at School Number One (SNO) in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia, an autonomous republic in the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation. The hostage takers were the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion, sent by the Chechen separatist warlord Shamil Basayev who demanded an end to the Second Chechen War and Russian withdrawal from Chechnya. On the third day of the standoff, Russian security stormed the building, using tanks, incendiary rockets and other heavy weapons. Ultimately, at least 334 hostages were killed, including 186 children; hundreds more were injured and many were reported missing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Beslan_school_no_1_victim_photos.jpg/220px-Beslan_school_no_1_victim_photos.jpg
