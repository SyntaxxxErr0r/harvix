1.00	ROM_Game_File	ROM image	A ROM image, or ROM file, is a computer file which contains a copy of the data from a read-only memory chip, often from a video game cartridge, a computer's firmware, or from an arcade game's main board. The term is frequently used in the context of emulation, whereby older games or computer firmware are copied to ROM files on modern computers and can, using a piece of software known as an emulator, be run on the newer computer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Visolyflashlinker.jpg/220px-Visolyflashlinker.jpg
