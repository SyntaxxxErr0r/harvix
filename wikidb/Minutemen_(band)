51.9	Minutemen_(band)	Minutemen (band)	Minutemen were an American hardcore punk band formed in San Pedro, California, in 1980. Composed of guitarist D. Boon, bassist Mike Watt, and drummer George Hurley, Minutemen recorded four albums and eight EPs before Boon's death in an automobile accident in December 1985. They were noted in the California punk community for a philosophy of "jamming econo"—a sense of thriftiness reflected in their touring and presentation—while their eclectic and experimental attitude was instrumental in pioneering alternative rock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/Min85.JPG/220px-Min85.JPG
