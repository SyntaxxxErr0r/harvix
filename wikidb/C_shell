It has been distributed widely, beginning with the 2BSD release of the BSD Unix system that Joy began distributing in 1978. Other early contributors to the ideas or the code were Michael Ubell, Eric Allman, Mike O'Brien and Jim Kulp.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/TcshAndShScreenCapture.png/300px-TcshAndShScreenCapture.png
