67.6	Documentary_hypothesis	Documentary hypothesis	The documentary hypothesis, (sometimes called the Wellhausen hypothesis), holds that the Pentateuch (the Torah, or the Five Books of Moses) was derived from originally independent, parallel and complete narratives, which were subsequently combined into the current form by a series of redactors (editors). The number of these is usually set at four, but this is not an essential part of the hypothesis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Modern_document_hypothesis.svg/240px-Modern_document_hypothesis.svg.png
