1.20	Irish_Canadians	Irish Canadian	Irish Canadians are immigrants and descendants of immigrants who originated in Ireland. 1.2 million Irish immigrants arrived, 1825 to 1970, at least half of those in the period from 1831â€“1850. By 1867, they were the second largest ethnic group (after the French), and comprised 24% of Canada's population. The 1931 national census counted 1,230,000 Canadians of Irish descent, half of whom lived in Ontario. About one-third were Catholic in 1931 and two-thirds Protestants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/StPatQueens.jpg/220px-StPatQueens.jpg
