1.00	Hero_online	Hero Online	Hero Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) produced by Netgame based on a story written by three generations of Chinese novelists. Hero Online is free to play with cash shop items available, much like The Legend of Ares, Scions of Fate, Silkroad Online and many other MMORPG's. The player, when creating a character, is not only able to choose the gender of his/her character, but what kind of weapons their character will be using. These weapon proficiencies may or may not affect the job class people will choose when they reach a certain level for job change. Each of the five characters specializes in his or her own weaponry. For example "The Ruthless Blade" character with the ability to wield a bow, swords and blades. "The Piercing Eyes" character with the ability to use Swords, Blades and throwing weapon. "The Overseer of Sky" Uses axes, rods, and spears, and "The Elegant Mystic" which uses gauntlets, spears and rods. "The Mystic Muse" uses dual swords, dual rods, and a large instrument. The Monk uses rods and destructive spells.
