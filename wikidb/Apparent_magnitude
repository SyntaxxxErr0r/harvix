85.7	Apparent_magnitude	Apparent magnitude	The apparent magnitude of a celestial body is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth, adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The brighter the object appears, the lower the value of its magnitude.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/65Cyb-LB3-apmag.jpg/350px-65Cyb-LB3-apmag.jpg
