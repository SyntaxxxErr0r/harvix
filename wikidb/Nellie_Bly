58.0	Nellie_Bly	Nellie Bly	Nellie Bly (May 5, 1864 – January 27, 1922) was the pen name of American pioneer female journalist Elizabeth Jane Cochran. She remains notable for two feats: a record-breaking trip around the world in emulation of Jules Verne's character Phileas Fogg, and an exposé in which she faked insanity to study a mental institution from within. In addition to her writing, she was also an industrialist and charity worker. Her name was meant to be Nelly Bly, but her editor wrote Nellie Bly and it stuck.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Nellie_Bly_2.jpg/220px-Nellie_Bly_2.jpg
