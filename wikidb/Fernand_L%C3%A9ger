51.9	Fernand_L%C3%A9ger	Fernand Léger	Joseph Fernand Henri Léger (February 4, 1881 – August 17, 1955) was a French painter, sculptor, and filmmaker. In his early works he created a personal form of Cubism which he gradually modified into a more figurative, populist style. His boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter has caused him to be regarded as a forerunner of Pop art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Fernand_L%C3%A9ger.jpg/200px-Fernand_L%C3%A9ger.jpg
