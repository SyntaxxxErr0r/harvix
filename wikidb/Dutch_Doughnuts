1.00	Dutch_Doughnuts	Oliebol	An oliebol (plural oliebollen ) is a traditional Dutch food. Oliebollen (literally oil balls) are traditionally eaten on New Year's Eve and at funfairs. In wintertime, they are also sold in the street at mobile stalls. In the Flanders part of Belgium and Brussels they are called smoutebollen (literally lard balls although the real "smout" is of rapeseed oil) In English they are more commonly known as Dutch Doughnuts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Oliebollen.jpg/200px-Oliebollen.jpg
