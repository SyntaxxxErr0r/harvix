61.4	Chivalry	Chivalry	Chivalry, or the chivalric code, is the traditional code of conduct associated with the medieval institution of knighthood. It was originally conceived of as an aristocratic warrior code — the term derives from the French term for horseman — involving individual training and service to others. Over time its meaning has been refined to emphasize more ideals such as knightly virtues, honour and courtly love, and less the martial aspects of the tradition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Meister_der_Manessischen_Liederhandschrift_001.jpg/220px-Meister_der_Manessischen_Liederhandschrift_001.jpg
