50.38	Aldosterone	Aldosterone	Aldosterone is a yellow steroid hormone of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland, and acts mainly on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron, the functioning unit of the kidney, to cause the conservation of sodium, secretion of potassium, increased water retention, and increased blood pressure. The overall effect of aldosterone is to increase reabsorption of ions and water in the kidney -- increasing blood volume and, therefore, increasing blood pressure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Aldosterone-2D-skeletal.svg/200px-Aldosterone-2D-skeletal.svg.png
