89.6	Krampus	Krampus	Krampus is a mythical creature recognized in Alpine countries. According to legend, Krampus accompanies Saint Nicholas during the Christmas season, warning and punishing bad children, in contrast to St. Nicholas, who gives gifts to good children. When the Krampus finds a particularly naughty child, it stuffs the child in its sack and carries the frightened child away to its lair, presumably to devour for its Christmas dinner.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Nikolaus_krampus.jpg/220px-Nikolaus_krampus.jpg
