104.2	Nicotine	Nicotine	Nicotine is an alkaloid found in the nightshade family of plants that constitutes approximately 0.6â€“3.0% of the dry weight of tobacco, with biosynthesis taking place in the roots and accumulation occurring in the leaves. It functions as an antiherbivore chemical with particular specificity to insects; therefore nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past, and currently nicotine analogs such as imidacloprid continue to be widely used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Nicotine.svg/177px-Nicotine.svg.png
