1.10	Solar_eclipse_of_April_28,_1930	Solar eclipse of April 28, 1930	A total solar eclipse occurred on April 28, 1930. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partially obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across the surface of the Earth, while a partial solar eclipse will be visible over a region thousands of kilometres wide. This event is a hybrid, starting and ending as an annular eclipse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/SE1930Apr28H.png/320px-SE1930Apr28H.png
