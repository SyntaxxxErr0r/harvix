4.00	Well_water	Water well	A water well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, boring or drilling to access groundwater in underground aquifers. The well water is drawn by an electric submersible pump, a trash pump, a vertical turbine pump, a handpump or a mechanical pump (e.g. from a water-pumping windmill). It can also be drawn up using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Faryab-_village_dug_well.JPG/220px-Faryab-_village_dug_well.JPG
