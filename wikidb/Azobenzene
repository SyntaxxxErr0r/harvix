18.40	Azobenzene	Azobenzene	Azobenzene is a chemical compound composed of two phenyl rings linked by a N=N double bond. It is the best known example of an azo compound. The term 'azobenzene' or simply 'azo' is often used to refer to a wide class of molecules that share the core azobenzene structure, with different chemical functional groups extending from the phenyl rings. These azo compounds are considered as derivatives of diazene (diimide), and are sometimes referred to as 'diazenes'. The diazenes absorb light strongly and are used as dyes in a variety of industries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Azobenzene.svg/200px-Azobenzene.svg.png
