She was stabbed by Alex Wiensnote 2 an ethnic German immigrant from Russia, against whom she had testified in a criminal case for verbal abuse.

Wiens was arrested at the crime scene and subsequently tried for murder and attempted murder. He was found guilty of both charges, with the verdict qualifying the murder of El-Sherbin as a heinous crime because it was committed in front of a child, while attacking another person who tried to intervene. The judge stated that the perpetrator was motivated by hostility and prejudice against a race and religion. Wiens was sentenced to life imprisonment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Marwa_El-sherbini.jpeg/220px-Marwa_El-sherbini.jpeg
