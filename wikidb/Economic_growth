103.5	Economic_growth	Economic growth	Economic growth is the increase in the amount of the goods and services produced by an economy over time. It is conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in real gross domestic product, or real GDP. Growth is usually calculated in real terms, i.e. inflation-adjusted terms, in order to net out the effect of inflation on the price of the goods and services produced. In economics, "economic growth" or "economic growth theory" typically refers to growth of potential output, i.e., production at "full employment," which is caused by growth in aggregate demand or observed output.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Gdp_accumulated_change.png/350px-Gdp_accumulated_change.png
