89.1	Kinetic_energy	Kinetic energy	The kinetic energy of an object is the energy which it possesses due to its motion. It is defined as the work needed to accelerate a body of a given mass from rest to its stated velocity. Having gained this energy during its acceleration, the body maintains this kinetic energy unless its speed changes. The same amount of work is done by the body in decelerating from its current speed to a state of rest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Wooden_roller_coaster_txgi.jpg/220px-Wooden_roller_coaster_txgi.jpg
