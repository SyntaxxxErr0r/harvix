57.1	Deep_brain_stimulation	Deep brain stimulation	Deep brain stimulation is a surgical treatment involving the implantation of a medical device called a brain pacemaker, which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS in select brain regions has provided remarkable therapeutic benefits for otherwise treatment-resistant movement and affective disorders such as chronic pain, Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia. Despite the long history of DBS, its underlying principles and mechanisms are still not clear. DBS directly changes brain activity in a controlled manner, its effects are reversible (unlike those of lesioning techniques) and is one of only a few neurosurgical methods that allows blinded studies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Tiefe_Hirnstimulation_-_Sonden_RoeSchaedel_ap.jpg/230px-Tiefe_Hirnstimulation_-_Sonden_RoeSchaedel_ap.jpg
