Chemically, the precious metals are less reactive than most elements, have high lustre, are softer or more ductile, and have higher melting points than other metals. Historically, precious metals were important as currency but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial commodities. Gold, silver, platinum, and palladium each have an ISO 4217 currency code.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/GoldNuggetUSGOV.jpg/230px-GoldNuggetUSGOV.jpg
