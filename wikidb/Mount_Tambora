59.1	Mount_Tambora	Mount Tambora	Mount Tambora (or Tamboro) is an active stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, on the island of Sumbawa, Indonesia. Sumbawa is flanked both to the north and south by oceanic crust, and Tambora was formed by the active subduction zone beneath it. This raised Mount Tambora as high as 4,300 m (14,100 ft), making it formerly one of the tallest peaks in the Indonesian archipelago. After a large magma chamber inside the mountain filled over the course of several decades, volcanic activity reached a historic climax in the super-colossal eruption of April 1815. The 1815 eruption was approximately VEI 7, the only eruption of that size since the Lake Taupo eruption in about 180 CE.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Caldera_Mt_Tambora_Sumbawa_Indonesia.jpg/280px-Caldera_Mt_Tambora_Sumbawa_Indonesia.jpg
