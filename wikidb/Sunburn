62.3	Sunburn	Sunburn	A sunburn is a burn to living tissue, such as skin, which is produced by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, commonly from the sun's rays. Usual mild symptoms in humans and other animals include red or reddish skin that is hot to the touch, general fatigue, and mild dizziness. An excess of UV radiation can be life-threatening in extreme cases. Exposure of the skin to lesser amounts of UV radiation will often produce a suntan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/10/Fa83bb6f20f87b12a33341bdfd6282ce_17835046.jpeg/230px-Fa83bb6f20f87b12a33341bdfd6282ce_17835046.jpeg
