15.11	Zonohedron	Zonohedron	Let {v0, v1, ...} be a collection of three-dimensional vectors. With each vector vi we may associate a line segment {xivi|0≤xi≤1}. The Minkowski sum {Σxivi|0≤xi≤1} forms a zonohedron, and all zonohedra that contain the origin have this form. The vectors from which the zonohedron is formed are called its generators. This characterization allows the definition of zonohedra to be generalized to higher dimensions, giving zonotopes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Shapley%E2%80%93Folkman_lemma.svg/300px-Shapley%E2%80%93Folkman_lemma.svg.png
