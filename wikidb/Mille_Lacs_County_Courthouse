The facade consists of Bedford limestone over reinforced concrete. A two-story entrance pavilion is topped with concrete "turnings" on the corners and a carved swag and wreath in the center. The windows are adorned with small balustraded balconies. The interior is finished with terrazzo floors and a Wright-inspired leaded glass skylight over the octagonal atrium. Marble steps rise from the front door to the first level and continue to the second floor. Red wood woodwork is used throughout the building. In 1978 the building was renovated by Johnson and Forberg Associates of Minneapolis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Mille_Lacs_Courthouse.jpg/250px-Mille_Lacs_Courthouse.jpg
