It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members and an executive secretary elected by the Karolinska Institute. While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for "physiology or medicine" in his will. Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields. The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008. In 2008, the prize was awarded to Harald zur Hausen, Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier, who shared the prize amount of 10,000,000 SEK (slightly more than €1 million, or US$1.4 million). The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/NobelPrize.JPG/220px-NobelPrize.JPG
