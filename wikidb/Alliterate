2.00	Alliterate	Alliteration	In language, alliteration refers to the repetition of a particular sound in the first syllables of a series of words or phrases. Alliteration has historically developed largely through poetry, in which it more narrowly refers to the repetition of a consonant in any syllables that, according to the poem's meter, are stressed, as in James Thomson's verse "Comeâ€¦dragging the lazy languid Line along".
