It is the most complete extant early Buddhist canon. It was composed in North India, and preserved orally until it was committed to writing during the Fourth Buddhist Council in Sri Lanka in 29 BCE, approximately four hundred and fifty four years after the dying of Sh훮kyamuni. First printing of the whole Buddhist Canon was done by imperial order in China in CE 868.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Tipitaka1.jpg/300px-Tipitaka1.jpg
