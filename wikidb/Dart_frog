3.20	Dart_frog	Poison dart frog	Poison dart frog (also dart-poison frog, poison frog or formerly poison arrow frog) is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly-colored bodies. Although all wild dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic, levels of toxicity vary considerably from one species to the next and from one population to another. Many species are critically endangered. These amphibians are often called "dart frogs" due to the Amerindians' indigenous use of their toxic secretions to poison the tips of blowdarts. However, of over 175 species, only three have been documented as being used for this purpose (curare plants are more commonly used), and none come from the Dendrobates genus, which is characterized by the brilliant color and complex patterns of its members.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Blue-poison.dart.frog.and.Yellow-banded.dart.frog.arp.jpg/220px-Blue-poison.dart.frog.and.Yellow-banded.dart.frog.arp.jpg
