It was founded by King George V by royal proclamation on the 17 July 1917, when he changed the name of his family from the German Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (a branch of the House of Wettin) to the English Windsor, due to the anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom during World War I. Currently, the most prominent member of the House of Windsor is Queen Elizabeth II, the reigning monarch of the Commonwealth realms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Badge_of_the_House_of_Windsor.svg/180px-Badge_of_the_House_of_Windsor.svg.png
