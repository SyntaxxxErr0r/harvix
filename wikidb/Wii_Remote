186.6	Wii_Remote	Wii Remote	The Wii Remote UÄ« Rimokon), also known as the Wiimote, is the primary controller for Nintendo's Wii console. A main feature of the Wii Remote is its motion sensing capability, which allows the user to interact with and manipulate items on screen via gesture recognition and pointing through the use of accelerometer and optical sensor technology. Another feature is its expandability through the use of attachments. The attachment bundled with the Wii console is the Nunchuk, which complements the Wii Remote by providing functions similar to those in gamepad controllers. Some other attachments include the Wii Classic Controller, Wii Zapper, and the Wii Wheel, originally used for Mario Kart.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Wiimote.png/250px-Wiimote.png
