98.5	Blackadder	Blackadder	Blackadder is the name that encompassed four series of a BBC1 historical sitcom, along with several one-off installments. All television programme episodes starred Rowan Atkinson as anti-hero Edmund Blackadder and Tony Robinson as Blackadder's dogsbody, Baldrick. Each series was set in a different historical period with the two protagonists accompanied by different characters, though several reappear in one series or another, for example Melchett and Lord Flashheart.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Ba4.jpg/250px-Ba4.jpg
