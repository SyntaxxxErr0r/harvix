67.6	War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)	War in Afghanistan (2001â€“present)	The War in Afghanistan, also called the Afghan war, began on October 7, 2001, as the armed forces of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Afghan United Front (Northern Alliance) launched Operation Enduring Freedom. The primary driver of the invasion was the September 11 attacks on the United States, with the stated goal of dismantling the al-Qaeda terrorist organization and ending its use of Afghanistan as a base. The United States also said that it would remove the Taliban regime from power and create a viable democratic state. A decade into the war, the U.S. continues to battle a widespread Taliban insurgency, and the war has expanded into the tribal areas of neighboring Pakistan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/2001_War_in_Afghanistan_collage_3.jpg/300px-2001_War_in_Afghanistan_collage_3.jpg
