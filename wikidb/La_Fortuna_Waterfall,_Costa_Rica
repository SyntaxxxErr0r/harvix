In Spanish, it is known as Catarata Fortuna. The waterfall drops about 70-75 meters and is located at the base of the dormant Chato volcano, about 5.5 km outside of the town of La Fortuna, near the Arenal Volcano. It is fed by the Tenorio River, which travels through the rain forest in the Arenal Mountain range until it plunges over the cliff, forming this waterfall.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Lafortunawaterfall.jpg/220px-Lafortunawaterfall.jpg
