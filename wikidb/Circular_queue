8.31	Circular_queue	Circular buffer	A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Circular_buffer.svg/200px-Circular_buffer.svg.png
