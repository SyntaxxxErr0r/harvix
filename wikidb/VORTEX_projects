6.01	VORTEX_projects	VORTEX projects	The Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment or VORTEX, field projects study tornadoes. VORTEX1 was the first time scientists completely researched the entire evolution of a tornado, enabling a greater understanding of the processes involved with tornadogenesis. VORTEX2 is using enhanced technology allowing scientists to improve forecasting capabilities to improve advance warnings to residents. VORTEX2 is seeking to explain how tornadoes form, how long they last and why they last that long, and what causes them to dissipate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/NSSL_vehicles_on_Project_Vortex.jpg/300px-NSSL_vehicles_on_Project_Vortex.jpg
