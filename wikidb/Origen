67.1	Origen	Origen	Origen , or Origen Adamantius (184/185 â€“ 253/254), was an early Christian Alexandrian scholar and theologian, and one of the most distinguished writers of the early Church. As early as the fourth century, his orthodoxy was suspect, in part because he believed in the pre-existence of souls. Today he is regarded as one of the Church Fathers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Origen3.jpg
