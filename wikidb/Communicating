10.00	Communicating	Communication	Communication is the activity of conveying information. Communication has been derived from the Latin word "communis", meaning to share. Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space. Communication requires that the communicating parties share an area of communicative commonality. The communication process is complete once the receiver has understood the message of the sender. Feedback is critical to effective communication between parties.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Communication_shannon-weaver2.svg/270px-Communication_shannon-weaver2.svg.png
