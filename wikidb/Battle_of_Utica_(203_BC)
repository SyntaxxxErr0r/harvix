3.10	Battle_of_Utica_(203_BC)	Battle of Utica (203 BC)	The Battle of Utica was fought in 203 BC between armies of Rome and Carthage during their second war for dominance over the Western Mediterranean. By a sudden attack the Roman commander Publius Cornelius Scipio managed to destroy a numerous force of the Carthaginians and their Numidian allies not far from the outflow of the Medjerda River in modern Tunisia. Thus he gained a decisive strategic advantage, switched the focus of the war from Italy and Iberia to the Carthaginian northern Africa and contributed largely for the final victory of Rome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Rome_carthage_218.jpg/300px-Rome_carthage_218.jpg
