101.6	Charcuterie	Charcuterie	Charcuterie ( or ; French: , from chair 'flesh' and cuit 'cooked') is the branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat products such as bacon, ham, sausage, terrines, galantines, pâtés, and confit, primarily from pork. Charcuterie is part of the garde manger chef's repertoire. Originally intended as a way to preserve meats before the advent of refrigeration, they are prepared today for their flavors derived from the preservation processes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Saucisson_02.JPG/300px-Saucisson_02.JPG
