7.61	By_All_Means_Necessary	By All Means Necessary	By All Means Necessary is the second album from hip hop group Boogie Down Productions, released in 1988, on Jive Records. After the murder of DJ/Producer Scott La Rock in 1987, MC KRS-One moved away from the violence that dominated their debut Criminal Minded and began to write socially conscious songs, while using the moniker "The Teacher".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/BDPByAllMeans.jpg/220px-BDPByAllMeans.jpg
