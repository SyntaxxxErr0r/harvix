169.4	MUD	MUD	A MUD (originally Multi-User Dungeon, with later variants Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain), is a multiplayer real-time virtual world, usually text-based. MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects, other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world. Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Role-playing_video_game_icon.svg/100px-Role-playing_video_game_icon.svg.png
