15.60	Krak%C3%B3w_Ghetto	Kraków Ghetto	The Kraków Ghetto was one of five major, metropolitan Jewish ghettos created by Nazi Germany in the General Government territory for the purpose of persecution, terror, and exploitation of Polish Jews during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. It was a staging point to begin dividing "able workers" from those who would later be deemed unworthy of life. The Ghetto was liquidated between June 1942 and March 1943, with most of its inhabitants sent to Belzec and Płaszów, and exterminated at Auschwitz concentration camp.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bundesarchiv_Bild_121-0296%2C_Krakau%2C_Judenlager.jpg/260px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_121-0296%2C_Krakau%2C_Judenlager.jpg
