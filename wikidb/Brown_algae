20.72	Brown_algae	Brown algae	The Phaeophyceae or brown algae (singular: alga), is a large group of mostly marine multicellular algae, including many seaweeds of colder Northern Hemisphere waters. They play an important role in marine environments, both as food and for the habitats they form. For instance Macrocystis, a kelp of the order Laminariales, may reach 60 m in length, and forms prominent underwater forests. Another example is Sargassum, which creates unique habitats in the tropical waters of the Sargasso Sea. Many brown algae, such as members of the order Fucales, commonly grow along rocky seashores. Some members of the class are used as food for humans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Kelp-forest-Monterey.jpg/220px-Kelp-forest-Monterey.jpg
