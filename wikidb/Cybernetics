154.8	Cybernetics	Cybernetics	Cybernetics is the interdisciplinary study of the structure of regulatory systems. Cybernetics is closely related to information theory, control theory and systems theory, at least in its first-order form. (Second-order cybernetics has crucial methodological and epistemological implications that are fundamental to the field as a whole.) Both in its origins and in its evolution in the second half of the 20th century, cybernetics is equally applicable to physical and social (that is, language-based) systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Model_Cybernetic_Factory.svg/360px-Model_Cybernetic_Factory.svg.png
