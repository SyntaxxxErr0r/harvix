8.31	Hyperboreans	Hyperborea	In Greek mythology the Hyperboreans were a mythical people who lived far to the north of Thrace. The Greeks thought that Boreas, the North Wind, lived in Thrace, and that therefore Hyperborea was an unspecified region in the northern lands that lay beyond the north wind. Their land, called Hyperborea or Hyperboria — "beyond the Boreas" — was perfect, with the sun shining twenty-four hours a day, which - if true - suggests a possible location within the Arctic Circle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Mercator_Septentrionalium_Terrarum_descriptio.jpg/220px-Mercator_Septentrionalium_Terrarum_descriptio.jpg
