115.1	Ford_Model_T	Ford Model T	The Ford Model T is an automobile that was produced by Henry Ford's Ford Motor Company from September 1908 to October 1927. It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile, the car that opened travel to the common middle-class American; some of this was because of Ford's innovations, including assembly line production instead of individual hand crafting. The Ford Model T was named the world's most influential car of the 20th century in an international poll.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/1919_Ford_Model_T_Highboy_Coupe.jpg/250px-1919_Ford_Model_T_Highboy_Coupe.jpg
