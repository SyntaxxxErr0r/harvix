118.3	Business_process_management	Business process management	Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. It promotes business effectiveness and efficiency while striving for innovation, flexibility, and integration with technology. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can therefore be described as a "process optimization process." It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, more effective and more capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Business_Process_Management_Life-Cycle.svg/150px-Business_Process_Management_Life-Cycle.svg.png
