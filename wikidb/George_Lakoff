242.4	George_Lakoff	George Lakoff	George P. Lakoff ( , born May 24, 1941) is an American cognitive linguist and professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he has taught since 1972. Although some of his research involves questions traditionally pursued by linguists, such as the conditions under which a certain linguistic construction is grammatically viable, he is most famous for his ideas about the centrality of metaphor to human thinking, political behavior and society. He is particularly famous for his concept of the "embodied mind", which he has written about in relation to mathematics. In recent years he has applied his work to the realm of politics, exploring this in his books. He is a member of the scientific committee of the Fundacion IDEAS, Spain's Socialist Party's think tank. He was the founder of the now defunct progressive think tank the Rockridge Institute.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Pop%21Tech_2008_-_George_Lakoff.jpg/250px-Pop%21Tech_2008_-_George_Lakoff.jpg
