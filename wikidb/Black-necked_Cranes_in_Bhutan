They visit the Phobhjikha valley in large numbers, which is a declared protected area for the cranes, and also to other valleys in smaller numbers in central and eastern Bhutan. On arrival in the Phobhjikha (also called the 'Gangtey Valley') they are seen to circle the Gangteng Monastery (also known as Gangten Gonpa) three times as if they are paying obeisance to the gods in the monastery and repeat this act while returning to Tibet Ñ–n early spring. The Jigme Dorji Wongchuk Sanctuary, adjoining the Phobjika Valley across the Black Mountains Range, has within its precincts, the crane wintering area at Bumdeling, which also has been declared a protected area. These cranes known by the binomial name Grus nigricollis and also as Tibetan Crane are categorized as Vulnerable (Vu) in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species maintained by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) under Appendix I and II of CITES. The Black-necked Cranes, the last to be found among the 16 species of cranes, were first identified by Nikolai Przhevalsky of the Imperial Russian Army in 1876 in the Tibetan Plateau.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/GrusNigricollisBlyth.jpg/220px-GrusNigricollisBlyth.jpg
