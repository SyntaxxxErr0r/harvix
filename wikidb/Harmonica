68.2	Harmonica	Harmonica	The harmonica, also called harp, French harp, blues harp, and mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used primarily in blues and American folk music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. It is played by blowing air into it or drawing air out by placing lips over individual holes (reed chambers) or multiple holes. The pressure caused by blowing or drawing air into the reed chambers causes a reed or multiple reeds to vibrate creating sound. Each chamber has multiple, variable-tuned brass or bronze reeds, which are secured at one end only, leaving the other free to vibrate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/16-hole_chrom_10-hole_diatonic.jpg/250px-16-hole_chrom_10-hole_diatonic.jpg
