2.23	Epsom_College	Epsom College	Epsom College is a co-educational independent school in the town of Epsom in Surrey, in Southern England, for pupils aged 13 to 18. Founded in 1853 as a boys' school to provide support for poor members of the medical profession such as pensioners and orphans ("Foundationers"), Epsom's long-standing association with medicine was estimated in 1980 as having helped almost a third of its 10,000 alumni enter that profession. The college caters for both boarding and day pupils. The headmaster is a member of the Headmasters' Conference. The college's patron is HM The Queen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/Epsom-College-logo.jpg
