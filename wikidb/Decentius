1.11	Decentius	Decentius	Magnus Decentius (died 18 August 353) was a usurper of the Western Roman Empire against emperor Constantius II. American scholar Michael DiMaio speculates that Decentius possibly was the brother of Magnentius, who had revolted against Constantius on 18 January 350.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/149_Decentius.jpg/220px-149_Decentius.jpg
