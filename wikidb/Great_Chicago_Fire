118.1	Great_Chicago_Fire	Great Chicago Fire	The Great Chicago Fire was a conflagration that burned from Sunday, October 8, to early Tuesday, October 10, 1871, killing hundreds and destroying about 3.3 square miles (9 km2) in Chicago, Illinois. Though the fire was one of the largest U.S. disasters of the 19th century, the rebuilding that began almost immediately spurred Chicago's development into one of the most populous and economically important American cities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Chicago-fire1.jpg/300px-Chicago-fire1.jpg
