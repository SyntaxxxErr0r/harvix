72.2	Rage_Against_the_Machine	Rage Against the Machine	Rage Against the Machine is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group's line-up consists of vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello and drummer Brad Wilk. Rage Against the Machine is best known for its left-wing political views and "fiercely polemical music, which brewed sloganeering leftist rants against corporate America, cultural imperialism, and government oppression into a Molotov cocktail of punk, hip hop, and thrash." Rage Against the Machine drew inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation, as well as rap acts such as Afrika Bambaataa, Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and Urban Dance Squad. As of 2010, they have sold over 16 million records worldwide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Rage_Against_The_Machine.jpg/250px-Rage_Against_The_Machine.jpg
