8.00	Memory-mapped_IO	Memory-mapped I/O	Memory-mapped I/O and port I/O (also called isolated I/O or port-mapped I/O abbreviated PMIO) are two complementary methods of performing input/output between the CPU and peripheral devices in a computer. An alternative approach, not discussed here, is using dedicated I/O processors — commonly known as channels on mainframe computers — that execute their own instructions.
