2.00	Cadmium_Red	Cadmium pigments	Cadmium pigments are a class of pigments that have cadmium as one of the chemical components. They are highly toxic and can produce cadmium poisoning. Most of cadmium produced worldwide is used in the production of nickel-cadmium batteries, but about half the remaining consumption, which is about 2,000 tons annually, is used to produce colored cadmium pigments. The principal pigments are a family of yellow/orange/red cadmium sulfides and sulfoselenides. Cadmium yellow is cadmium sulfide (CdS); by adding increasing amounts of selenium, colors ranging from orange to nearly black (the color of cadmium selenide) can be produced. Cadmium yellow is sometimes mixed with viridian to give a bright, pale green mixture called cadmium green.
