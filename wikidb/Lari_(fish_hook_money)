2.00	Lari_(fish_hook_money)	Lari (fish hook money)	Larin (plural: lari) is the name of a class of objects serving as coins in areas around the Arabian Sea. The name is derived from Lar, a Persian town that according to tradition would have been the first to produce lari. A larin was a piece of silver wire of about 10 centimeters long, usually folded in two equal parts and shaped like a C, though there are also lari shaped like a J, an I or an S. Lari were stamped with an Arabic or Persian text, usually the name of the local ruler. The I was most popular among the Arabs and Persians, while the J and S were typical for the island of Ceylon. The latter were known as "koku risi" (silver hook) among the Sinhalese.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Larin_661866.jpg/300px-Larin_661866.jpg
