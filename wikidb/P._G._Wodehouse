126.6	P._G._Wodehouse	P. G. Wodehouse	Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, KBE (15 October 1881 â€“ 14 February 1975) was a British humorist, whose body of work includes novels, short stories, plays, poems, song lyrics, and numerous pieces of journalism. He enjoyed enormous popular success during a career that lasted more than seventy years and his many writings continue to be widely read. Despite the political and social upheavals that occurred during his life, much of which was spent in France and the United States, Wodehouse's main canvas remained that of pre-1914 English upper-class society, reflecting his birth, education, and youthful writing career.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/PGWodehouse.jpg/200px-PGWodehouse.jpg
