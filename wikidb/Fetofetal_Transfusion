2.00	Fetofetal_Transfusion	Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome	Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS, also known as Feto-Fetal Transfusion Syndrome (FFTS) and Twin Oligohydramnios-Polyhydramnios Sequence (TOPS)) is a complication of disproportionate blood supply, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. It can affect monochorionic multiples, that is multiple pregnancies where two or more fetuses share a chorion and hence a single placenta. Severe TTTS has a 60â€“100% mortality rate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/TTTS_babypic.jpeg/230px-TTTS_babypic.jpeg
