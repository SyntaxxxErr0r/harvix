62.8	Triceratops	Triceratops	Triceratops ( -ə-tops) is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur which lived during the late Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, around 68 to 65 million years ago (Mya) in what is now North America. It was one of the last non-avian dinosaur genera to appear before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The term Triceratops, which literally means "three-horned face," is derived from the Greek τρί- meaning "three", κέρας (kéras) meaning "horn", and ὤψ (ops) meaning "face".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Triceratops_side_view.jpg/250px-Triceratops_side_view.jpg
