93.2	Web_of_trust	Web of trust	In cryptography, a web of trust is a concept used in PGP, GnuPG, and other OpenPGP-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner. Its decentralized trust model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority (or a hierarchy of such). As with computer networks, there are many independent webs of trust, and any user (through their identity certificate) can be a part of, and a link between, multiple webs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/MSD-Based_Trust.png/220px-MSD-Based_Trust.png
