56.2	Toad_in_the_hole	Toad in the hole	Toad in the hole is a traditional English dish consisting of sausages in Yorkshire pudding batter, usually served with vegetables and onion gravy. The origin of the name "Toad-in-the-Hole" is often disputed. Many suggestions are that the dish's resemblance to a toad sticking its head out of a hole provides the dish with its somewhat unusual name. It is rumoured to have been called "Frog-in-the-Hole", at one time, although little if any evidence corroborates this assertion. It can also be referred to, less popularly, as "sausage toad".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Toad_in_the_hole.jpg/250px-Toad_in_the_hole.jpg
