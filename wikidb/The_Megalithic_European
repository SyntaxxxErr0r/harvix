Like its predecessor - The Modern Antiquarian - the book is split into a shorter, discursive introduction with the bulk of the text being a gazetteer of sites. As with The Modern Antiquarian, sites are listed alphabetically within their sections.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Megalithiceuropean.jpg/200px-Megalithiceuropean.jpg
