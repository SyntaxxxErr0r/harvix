57.7	Enabling_Act_of_1933	Enabling Act of 1933	The Enabling Act was passed by Germany's Reichstag and signed by President Paul von Hindenburg on 23 March 1933. It was the second major step, after the Reichstag Fire Decree, through which Chancellor Adolf Hitler legally obtained plenary powers and established his dictatorship. It received its name from its legal status as an enabling act granting the Cabinet the authority to enact laws without the participation of the Reichstag. The act stated that it was to last for four years unless renewed by the Reichstag, which occurred twice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-14439%2C_Rede_Adolf_Hitlers_zum_Erm%C3%A4chtigungsgesetz.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-14439%2C_Rede_Adolf_Hitlers_zum_Erm%C3%A4chtigungsgesetz.jpg
