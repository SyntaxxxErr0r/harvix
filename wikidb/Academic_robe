1.00	Academic_robe	Academic dress	Academic dress or academical dress is a traditional form of clothing for academic settings, primarily tertiary (and sometimes secondary) education, worn mainly by those that have been admitted to a university degree (or similar) or hold a status that entitles them to assume them (e.g., undergraduate students at certain old universities). It is also known as academicals and, in the United States, as academic regalia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Dphil_gown.jpg/220px-Dphil_gown.jpg
