63.7	Irrational_number	Irrational number	It has been suggested that the concept of irrationality was implicitly accepted by Indian mathematicians since the 7th century BC, when Manava (c. 750â€“690 BC) believed that the square roots of numbers such as 2 and 61 could not be exactly determined. However, Boyer states that "such claims are not well substantiated and unlikely to be true".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Square_root_of_2_triangle.svg/220px-Square_root_of_2_triangle.svg.png
