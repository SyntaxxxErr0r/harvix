In the fall of 2006 it became number one on both the New York Times and Amazon.com bestsellers lists after Obama was endorsed by Oprah Winfrey. In the book, Obama expounds on many of the subjects that became part of his 2008 campaign for the presidency. The book advance from the publisher totalled $1.9 million contracted for three books. Obama announced his ultimately successful presidential campaign on February 10, 2007, a little less than three months after the book's release.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/28/AudacityofHope.jpg/200px-AudacityofHope.jpg
