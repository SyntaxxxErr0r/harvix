159.8	Gulf_of_Mexico	Gulf of Mexico	The Gulf of Mexico via the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba. With this narrow connection to the Atlantic, the Gulf experiences very small tidal ranges. The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 615,000 mi² (1.6 million km²). Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters. At its deepest it is 14,383 ft (4,384 m) at the Sigsbee Deep, an irregular trough more than 300 nautical miles (560 km) (550 km) long. The basin contains a volume of roughly 660 quadrillion gallons (2.5 × 106 km3). It was formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Fixed_gulf_map.png/300px-Fixed_gulf_map.png
