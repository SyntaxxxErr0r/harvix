60.5	Ancient_history	Ancient history	Ancient history is the study of the written past from the beginning of recorded human history to the Early Middle Ages. The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years, with Cuneiform script, the oldest discovered form of coherent writing, from the protoliterate period around the 30th century BC. This is the beginning of history, as opposed to prehistory, according to the definition used by most historians.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg/300px-Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg
