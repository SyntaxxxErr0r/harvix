1.00	Mafia	Sicilian Mafia	The Mafia (also known as Cosa Nostra) is a criminal syndicate that emerged in the mid-nineteenth century in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organizational structure and code of conduct, and whose common enterprise is protection racketeering. Each group, known as a "family", "clan", or "cosca", claims sovereignty over a territory in which it operates its rackets â€“ usually a town or village or a neighbourhood of a larger city. Its members call themselves "men of honor", although the public often refers to them as "mafiosi".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Sicilian_mafia_1901_maxi_trial.jpg/300px-Sicilian_mafia_1901_maxi_trial.jpg
