73.6	Pebble_bed_reactor	Pebble bed reactor	The pebble bed reactor is a graphite-moderated, gas-cooled, nuclear reactor. It is a type of very high temperature reactor (VHTR), one of the six classes of nuclear reactors in the Generation IV initiative. Like other VHTR designs, the PBR uses TRISO fuel particles, which allows for high outlet temperatures and passive safety. Berkeley professor Richard A. Muller has called pebble bed reactors "in every way... safer than the present nuclear reactors, and arguably safer than the global-warming danger posed by fossil fuels".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Pebble_bed_reactor_scheme_%28italiano%29.jpg/220px-Pebble_bed_reactor_scheme_%28italiano%29.jpg
