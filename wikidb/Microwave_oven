73.1	Microwave_oven	Microwave oven	A microwave oven (often referred to colloquially simply as a "microwave") is a kitchen appliance that heats food by dielectric heating. This is accomplished with radiation used to heat polarized molecules in food. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently, because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 1 inch (25 mm) to 1.5 inches (38 mm) of a dense (high water content) food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in thick, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/NN-K125MBGPG_Grill-Mikrowelle_silber_Panasonic.gif/220px-NN-K125MBGPG_Grill-Mikrowelle_silber_Panasonic.gif
