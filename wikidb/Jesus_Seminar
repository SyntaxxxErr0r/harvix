64.0	Jesus_Seminar	Jesus Seminar	The Jesus Seminar is a group of about 150 critical scholars and laymen founded in 1985 by Robert Funk under the auspices of the Westar Institute. The seminar uses votes with colored beads to decide their collective view of the historicity of the deeds and sayings of Jesus of Nazareth. They produced new translations of the New Testament and apocrypha to use as textual sources. They published their results in three reports: The Five Gospels (1993), The Acts of Jesus (1998), and The Gospel of Jesus (1999). They also run a series of lectures and workshops in various U.S. cities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/11_08_6972_John_Dominic_Crossan.jpg/200px-11_08_6972_John_Dominic_Crossan.jpg
