56.6	Hamming_distance	Hamming distance	In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. Put another way, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the number of errors that transformed one string into the other.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Hamming_distance_3_bit_binary.svg/140px-Hamming_distance_3_bit_binary.svg.png
