97.7	Cereal	Cereal	Cereals are grasses (members of the monocot family Poaceae, also known as Gramineae) cultivated for the edible components of their grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop ; they are therefore staple crops.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Various_grains.jpg/250px-Various_grains.jpg
