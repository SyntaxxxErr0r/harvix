8.10	Cocain	Cocaine	Cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine) is a crystalline tropane alkaloid that is obtained from the leaves of the coca plant. The name comes from "coca" in addition to the alkaloid suffix -ine, forming cocaine. It is a stimulant of the central nervous system, an appetite suppressant, and a topical anesthetic. Specifically, it is a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which mediates functionality of these neurotransmitters as an exogenous catecholamine transporter ligand. It is addicting because of the way it affects the mesolimbic reward pathway.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Kokain_-_Cocaine.svg/220px-Kokain_-_Cocaine.svg.png
