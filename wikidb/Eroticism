29.73	Eroticism	Eroticism	Eroticism (from the Greek ἔρως, eros—"desire") is generally understood to refer to a state of sexual arousal or anticipation of such – an insistent sexual impulse, desire, or pattern of thoughts, as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the aesthetics of sexual desire, sensuality and romantic love. In her introduction to the women's erotic fiction anthology Totally Heterotica, erotic artist and lesbian theorist Susie Bright states: "The very word 'erotic' implies superior value, fine art, an aesthetic which elevates the mind and incidentally stimulates the body". As French novelist Honore de Balzac pointed out, eroticism is dependent not just upon an individual's sexual morality, but the culture and time that individual resides in as well.
