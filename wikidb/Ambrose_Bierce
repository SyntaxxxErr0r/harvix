120.4	Ambrose_Bierce	Ambrose Bierce	Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce (born June 24, 1842; died sometime after December 26, 1913) was an American editorialist, journalist, short story writer, fabulist, and satirist. Today, he is probably best-known for his short story "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" and his satirical lexicon The Devil's Dictionary. His vehemence as a critic, his motto "Nothing matters" and the sardonic view of human nature that informed his work all earned him the nickname "Bitter Bierce".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Abierce_1866.jpg/200px-Abierce_1866.jpg
