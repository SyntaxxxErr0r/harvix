60.5	Y_chromosome	Y chromosome	The Y chromosome is one of the two sex-determining chromosomes in most mammals, including humans. In mammals, it contains the gene SRY, which triggers testis development if present. The human Y chromosome is composed of about 60 million base pairs. DNA in the Y chromosome is passed from father to son, and Y-DNA analysis may thus be used in genealogy research. With a 30% difference between humans and chimpanzees, the Y chromosome is one of the fastest evolving parts of the human genome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Chromosome_Y.svg/125px-Chromosome_Y.svg.png
