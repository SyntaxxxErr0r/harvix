59.9	Domestic_sheep	Sheep	Sheep are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name "sheep" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Flock_of_sheep.jpg/250px-Flock_of_sheep.jpg
