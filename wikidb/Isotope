71.5	Isotope	Isotope	Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element. While all isotopes of a given element share the same number of protons, each isotope differs from the others in its number of neutrons. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos (ἴσος "equal") and topos (τόπος "place"). Hence: "the same place," meaning that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table. The number of protons within the atom's nucleus uniquely identifies an element, but a given element may in principle have any number of neutrons. The number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus, known as the mass number, is not the same for two isotopes of any element.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Discovery_of_neon_isotopes.JPG
