2.00	Attitude_Era	The Attitude Era	The Attitude Era was a period in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) (known now as WWE) and professional wrestling history that began as a direct result of the Monday Night Wars, a television ratings conflict between the WWF and longtime rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) that lasted from September 1995 to March 2001, when the WWF acquired WCW. Similar to the 1980s professional wrestling boom, the Attitude Era was a surge in the popularity of professional wrestling in the United States from the mid-to-late 1990s to the early 2000s, as television ratings and pay-per-view buy-rates hit record highs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c1/WWFLogo98-02.png
