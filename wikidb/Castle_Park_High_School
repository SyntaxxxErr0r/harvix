1.00	Castle_Park_High_School	Castle Park High School	Castle Park High School, established in 1963, is a high school in Chula Vista, California. It offers Advanced Placement classes. Along with Bonita Vista High School, it is one of only two schools in the Sweetwater Unified School District that offers International Baccalaureate classes. Many of Castle Park's classrooms were renovated in 2006 by Turner Construction Company, and as a result classrooms now are air-conditioned with energy efficient lighting and windows. Classrooms are also now internet ready and have new whiteboards, cabinets, flooring, and paint. The school's landscape was recently cleaned up in 2009 - 2010, and the entire school was repainted on the exterior with a more rich, earth toned tan color in 2011. These much needed improvements will be followed up by another phase of construction which is slated to begin within the next few years with Proposition O.
