2.00	Annotating	Annotation	An annotation is a note that is made while reading any form of text. This may be as simple as underlining or highlighting passages. Annotated bibliographies give descriptions about how each source is useful to an author in constructing a paper or argument. Creating these comments, usually a few sentences long, establishes a summary for and expresses the relevance of each source prior to writing. The term also has a special meaning in a number of other fields.
