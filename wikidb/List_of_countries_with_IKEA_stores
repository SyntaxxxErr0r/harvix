2.10	List_of_countries_with_IKEA_stores	List of countries with IKEA stores	The original IKEA store was opened in Sweden in 1958. The first stores outside Sweden were opened in Norway (1963) and Denmark (1969). In the 1970s, stores spread to other parts of Europe, with the first store outside Scandinavia opening in Switzerland (1973), followed by Germany (1974). During the same decade, stores were opened in other parts of the world, including Japan, (1974), Australia, Canada, and Hong Kong (1975), The Netherlands and Singapore (1978). Germany, with 45 stores, is IKEA's biggest market, followed by the United States, with 35. IKEA now has 316 stores in 38 countries. However, the company has thus far not shown much of a presence in the developing countries. The location for the store is vitally important for IKEA as it should be near major roads, freeways and/or public transport.
