1.00	Togiak_National_Wildlife_Refuge	Togiak National Wildlife Refuge	Dominated by the Ahklun Mountains in the north and the cold waters of Bristol Bay to the south, Togiak National Wildlife Refuge confronts the traveler with a kaleidoscope of landscapes. The natural forces that have shaped this land range from the violent and powerful to the geologically patient. Earthquakes and volcanoes filled the former role, and their marks can still be found, but it was the gradual advance and retreat of glacial ice that carved many of the physical features of this refuge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Ahklun_and_Wood_River_Mountains.jpg/284px-Ahklun_and_Wood_River_Mountains.jpg
