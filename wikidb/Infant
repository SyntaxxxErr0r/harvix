107.8	Infant	Infant	An infant (from the Latin word infans, meaning "unable to speak" or "speechless") is the very young offspring of a human or other mammal. When applied to humans, the term is usually considered synonymous with baby, but the latter is commonly applied to the young of any animal. When a human child learns to walk, the term toddler may be used instead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Happiness.jpg/220px-Happiness.jpg
