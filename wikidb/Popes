12.41	Popes	List of popes	The list of popes chronologically lists the men who have been given the title Pope (or Bishop of Rome) by the Catholic Church. The Annuario Pontificio, published every year by the Vatican, contains a list that is generally considered to be the most authoritative. The Annuario Pontificio lists Benedict XVI as the 265th Bishop of Rome. That list is the one given here; it lists 263 men serving 265 pontificates (periods of Papal office), if Pope-elect Stephen is excluded (see below). The difference in these numbers is because Benedict IX reigned during three non-consecutive periods between 1032 and 1048.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Tafel_paepste.jpg/220px-Tafel_paepste.jpg
