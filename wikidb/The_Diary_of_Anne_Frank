15.61	The_Diary_of_Anne_Frank	The Diary of a Young Girl	The Diary of a Young Girl is a book of the writings from the Dutch language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944 and Anne Frank ultimately died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The diary was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the only known survivor of the family. The diary has now been published in more than 60 different languages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/First_edition.jpg/240px-First_edition.jpg
