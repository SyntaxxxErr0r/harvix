12.21	Non-metropolitan_county	Non-metropolitan county	A non-metropolitan county, or shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term shire county is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix "-shire" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. "Shire county" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived "county" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word "shire".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/English_non-metropolitan_counties_2009.svg/220px-English_non-metropolitan_counties_2009.svg.png
