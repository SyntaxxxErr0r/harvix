It was constructed between 1933 and 1942, originally with two power plants. A third power station was completed in 1974 to increase its energy production. It is the largest electric power-producing facility in the United States and one of the largest concrete structures in the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Grand_Coulee_Dam.jpg/220px-Grand_Coulee_Dam.jpg
