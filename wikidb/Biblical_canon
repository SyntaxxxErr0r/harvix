79.1	Biblical_canon	Biblical canon	A biblical canon, or canon of scripture, is a list of books considered to be authoritative scripture by a particular religious community. While this terminology may be applied to any scriptural tradition, the scope of this article is mainly Judeo-Christian in nature. The word "canon" comes from the Greek "κανών", meaning "rule" or "measuring stick". The term was first coined in reference to scripture by Christians, but the idea is said to be Jewish. The textual basis of the canon can also be specified. For example, the Hebrew/Aramaic text as vocalized and pointed (cf. niqqud) in the medieval era by the Masoretes, the Masoretic text, is the canonical text for Judaism. A modern example of this closing of a textual basis, in a process analogous to the closing of the canon itself, is the King James Only movement, which takes either the actual English text of various redactions of the actual King James Bible itself, or alternately, the textual basis of the King James Version — Bomberg's Masoretic text for the Old Testament and the Textus Receptus in various editions, those of Erasmus, Beza, and Stephanus, alongside the Complutensian polyglot, for the New Testament — as the specified, correct, and inspired textual tradition. Similarly, certain groups specify their paticular self-published version or translation of the Bible as the most reliable. Among these are the Jehovah's Witnesses, who produce the New World Translation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg/120px-Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg
