13.21	Solid-state_laser	Solid-state laser	Generally, the active medium of a solid-state laser consists of a glass or crystalline host material to which is added a dopant such as neodymium, chromium, erbium, or other ions. Many of the common dopants are rare earth elements, because the excited states of such ions are not strongly coupled with thermal vibrations of the crystalline lattice , and the lasing threshold can be reached at relatively low brightness of pump.
