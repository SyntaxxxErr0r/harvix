1.00	Dido_and_Aeneas_(Purcell)	Dido and Aeneas	Dido and Aeneas (Z. 626) is an opera in a prologue and three acts by the English Baroque composer Henry Purcell to a libretto by Nahum Tate. The first known performance was at Josias Priest's girls' school in London no later than the summer of 1688. The story is based on Book IV of Virgil's Aeneid. It recounts the love story of Dido, Queen of Carthage and the Trojan hero Aeneas, and her despair at his abandonment of her. A monumental work in Baroque opera, it is remembered as one of Purcell's foremost theatrical works. Dido and Aeneas was Purcell's first opera, as well as his only all-sung dramatic work. It is among the earliest English operas, and owes much to John Blow's Venus and Adonis, both in structure and overall effect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Henry_Purcell_by_John_Closterman.jpg/220px-Henry_Purcell_by_John_Closterman.jpg
