54.6	Neurotoxin	Neurotoxin	Neurotoxins, from the Greek νευρών (neuron) meaning sinew and τοξικόν (toxikon) meaning toxin, are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults which can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue. The term can also be used to classify endogenous compounds which when abnormally concentrated can prove neurologically toxic. Though neurotoxins are often neurologically destructive, their ability to specifically target neural components is important in the study of nervous systems. Common examples of neurotoxins include lead, ethanol, glutamate, nitric oxide (NO), botulinum toxin, tetanus toxin, and tetrodotoxin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Cyanobacterial_Scum.JPG/300px-Cyanobacterial_Scum.JPG
