58.0	Pug	Pug	The pug is a "toy" (small-lower medium) breed of dog with a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors, and a compact square body with well-developed muscle. They have been described as multum in parvo ("much in little"), referring to the pug's personality and small size. Known in ancient China as lo-sze, they may have been responsible for the English Bulldog, the modern Pekingese and King Charles spaniel. They have Chinese origins, but were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands and the House of Stuart of England, Ireland and Scotland.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Fawn_pug_2.5year-old.JPG/220px-Fawn_pug_2.5year-old.JPG
