62.6	Eddie_Fisher_(singer)	Eddie Fisher (singer)	Edwin John "Eddie" Fisher (August 10, 1928 â€“ September 22, 2010) was an American entertainer. He was one of the world's most famous and successful singers in the 1950s, selling millions of records and hosting his own TV show. He left his first wife, actress Debbie Reynolds, to marry Debbie's best friend, actress Elizabeth Taylor, when Taylor's husband film producer Mike Todd died. This event garnered scandalous and unwelcome publicity for Fisher. He later married Connie Stevens. Fisher is the father of actresses Carrie Fisher (with Reynolds), Joely Fisher (with Stevens), and Tricia Leigh Fisher (with Stevens).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/EddieFisherCokeTime.JPG/220px-EddieFisherCokeTime.JPG
