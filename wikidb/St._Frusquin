1.10	St._Frusquin	St. Frusquin	St. Frusquin (1893â€“1914) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a racing career that lasted from May 1895 to July 1896 he ran eleven times and won nine races. He was the best British two-year-old of 1895 when his five wins included the Middle Park Plate and the Dewhurst Plate. As a three-year-old he added wins in the 2000 Guineas and two of the season's most valuable all-aged races, the Princess of Wales's Stakes and the Eclipse Stakes. He had a notable rivalry with Persimmon, another outstanding British colt which he defeated in two of their three racecourse meetings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/St_Frusquin_3.jpg/240px-St_Frusquin_3.jpg
