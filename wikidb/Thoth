61.5	Thoth	Thoth	Thoth was considered one of the more important deities of the Egyptian pantheon. In art, he was often depicted as a man with the head of an ibis or a baboon, animals sacred to him. As in the main picture, Thoth is almost always shown holding a Was (a wand or rod symbolizing power) in one hand and an Ankh (the key of the Nile symbolizing life) in the other hand. His feminine counterpart was Seshat.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Thoth.svg/220px-Thoth.svg.png
