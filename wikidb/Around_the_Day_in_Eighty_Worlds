It pays homage to Julio's biggest literary influences while narrating new developments in the world of music during the 1960s, modern art (Dada and Surrealism) and some of the events in regard to the expanding involvement of the United States in other countries. The book also reveals for the first time one of Julio's pastimes in Paris: playing the trumpet.
