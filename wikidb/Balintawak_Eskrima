6.10	Balintawak_Eskrima	Balintawak Eskrima	Balintawak, also known as Balintawak Eskrima or Balintawak Arnis, is a style of Filipino martial art developed by Venancio Bacon in the 1950s from earlier tutelage of Lorenzo Saavedra. It is named after Cebu City's Balintawak Self Defense Club, where it was originally taught. In turn, the club took its name from the street of its location, Balintawak Street, where the original Balintawak masters trained.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Balintawak_Masters.gif/200px-Balintawak_Masters.gif
