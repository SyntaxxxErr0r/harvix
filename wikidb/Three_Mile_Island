52.4	Three_Mile_Island	Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station	Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (TMI) is a civilian nuclear power plant (NPP) located on Three Mile Island in the Susquehanna River, south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It has two separate units, known as TMI-1 and TMI-2. The plant is widely known for having been the site of the most significant accident in United States commercial nuclear energy, on March 28, 1979, when TMI-2 suffered a partial meltdown. According to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the accident resulted in no deaths or injuries to plant workers or members of nearby communities. The reactor core of TMI-2 has since been removed from the site, but the site has not been decommissioned.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Three_Mile_Island_%28color%29-2.jpg/220px-Three_Mile_Island_%28color%29-2.jpg
