6.01	WSTW	WSTW	WSTW (93.7 FM) is a hot adult contemporary formatted radio station that broadcasts in the Wilmington, Delaware metropolitan area which is just south of Philadelphia. Although the station and transmitter are located in Wilmington, the signal is strong enough to provide city-grade coverage of most of Philadelphia itself and at least Grade B coverage of most of the Philadelphia area. However, the station is only a minor factor in the Philadelphia radio market and focuses on Wilmington. WSTW is the dominant young adult targeted radio station covering Wilmington, DE and the southwestern suburbs of Philadelphia. But even though, up until 2010, was considered adult top 40, it is still reported by Mediabase &amp; Nielsen BDS as a contemporary hit radio station. WSTW's 2010 shift towards a contemporary hit radio direction met reporting standards, mainly due to Clear Channel Communications' WISX Philadelphia returning to adult top 40 from rhythmic adult contemporary. By March 2012, Philadelphia stopped having WISX as the market's only hot adult contemporary, and WSTW flipped to hot adult contemporary when Mediabase made a panel shift on WSTW from top 40 to hot AC.
