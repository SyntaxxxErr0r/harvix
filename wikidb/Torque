138.7	Torque	Torque	Torque, moment or moment of force (see the terminology below), is the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis, fulcrum, or pivot. Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Torque_animation.gif
