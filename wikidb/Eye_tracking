152.6	Eye_tracking	Eye tracking	Edmund Huey built an early eye tracker, using a sort of contact lens with a hole for the pupil. The lens was connected to an aluminum pointer that moved in response to the movement of the eye. Huey studied and quantified regressions (only a small proportion of saccades are regressions), and he showed that some words in a sentence are not fixated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Reading_Fixations_Saccades.jpg/320px-Reading_Fixations_Saccades.jpg
