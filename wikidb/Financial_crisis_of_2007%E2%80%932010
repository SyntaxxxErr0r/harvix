162.1	Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932010	Late-2000s financial crisis	The late-2000s financial crisis, also known as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) or the "Great Recession", is considered by many economists to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It resulted in the collapse of large financial institutions, the bailout of banks by national governments and downturns in stock markets around the world. In many areas, the housing market also suffered, resulting in numerous evictions, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment. It contributed to the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars, and a significant decline in economic activity, leading to a severe global economic recession in 2008.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/TED_Spread.png/300px-TED_Spread.png
