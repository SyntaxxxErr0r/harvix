The city covers the south of England and bordering on the Black Atlantic. It also has jurisdiction over Cal-Hab (covering part of Scotland) and Murphyville (Ireland), as seen in the Cal-Hab Justice strip. It is unknown what happened to Wales, outside of a mention of "the Gaels to the West" as a faction in the Brit-Cit Civil War during 2080.
