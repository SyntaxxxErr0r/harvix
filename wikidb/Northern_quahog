2.00	Northern_quahog	Hard clam	The hard clam , also known as a quahog (or quahaug), round clam, or hard-shell (or hard-shelled) clam, is an edible marine bivalve mollusk which is native to the eastern shores of North America, from Prince Edward Island to the Yucat√°n Peninsula. It is one of many unrelated edible bivalves which in the United States are frequently referred to simply as clams, as in the expression "clam digging". Older literature sources may use the systematic name Venus mercenaria; this species is indeed in the family Veneridae, the venus clams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/LittleNeck_clams_USDA96c1862.jpg/250px-LittleNeck_clams_USDA96c1862.jpg
