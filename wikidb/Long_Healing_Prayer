The authorized English translation was done in 1980 by Habib Taherzadeh and a Committee at the Bahá'í World Centre. The main part of the prayer consists of numerous rhythmic invocations of God, each ending with the phrase "Thou the Sufficing, Thou the Healing, Thou the Abiding, O Thou Abiding One."
