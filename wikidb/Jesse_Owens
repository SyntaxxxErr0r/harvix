78.6	Jesse_Owens	Jesse Owens	James Cleveland "Jesse" Owens (September 12, 1913 â€“ March 31, 1980) was an American track and field athlete who specialized in the sprints and the long jump. He participated in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, where he achieved international fame by winning four gold medals: one each in the 100 meters, the 200 meters, the long jump, and as part of the 4x100 meter relay team. He was the most successful athlete at the 1936 Summer Olympics, a victory more poignant and often noted because Adolf Hitler had intended the 1936 games to showcase his Aryan ideals and prowess.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Jesse_Owens3.jpg/250px-Jesse_Owens3.jpg
