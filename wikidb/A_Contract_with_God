30.22	A_Contract_with_God	A Contract with God	A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories is a graphic novel by Will Eisner that takes the form of several stories on a theme. Published by Baronet Books in October 1978 in simultaneous hardcover and trade paperback editions — the former limited to a signed-and-numbered print-run of 1,500 — it is often erroneously called the first graphic novel, or the first work to describe itself as such. It is nonetheless an early landmark of the form, and critically lauded in its own right. It was followed by two sequels set in the same tenement: A Life Force in 1988 and Dropsie Avenue in 1995.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b8/Contractwithgod.png/200px-Contractwithgod.png
