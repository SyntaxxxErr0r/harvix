214.7	Hippocampus	Hippocampus	The hippocampus is a major component of the brains of humans and other vertebrates. It belongs to the limbic system and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory and spatial navigation. Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, one in each side of the brain. The hippocampus is closely associated with the cerebral cortex, and in primates is located in the medial temporal lobe, underneath the cortical surface. It contains two main interlocking parts: Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Gray739-emphasizing-hippocampus.png/200px-Gray739-emphasizing-hippocampus.png
