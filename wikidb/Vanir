26.64	Vanir	Vanir	In Norse mythology, the Vanir (singular Vanr) are a group of Germanic gods associated with fertility, wisdom and the ability to see the future. The Vanir are one of two groups of gods (the other being the Æsir) and are the namesake of the location Vanaheimr ("Home of the Vanir"). After the Æsir–Vanir War, the Vanir became a subgroup of the Æsir. Subsequently, members of the Vanir are sometimes also referred to as members of the Æsir.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/John_Bauer-Freja.jpg/333px-John_Bauer-Freja.jpg
