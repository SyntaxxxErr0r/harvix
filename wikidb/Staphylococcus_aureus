168.0	Staphylococcus_aureus	Staphylococcus aureus	Staphylococcus aureus ( ) is a bacterial species named from Greek σταφυλόκοκκος meaning the "golden grape-cluster berry". Also known as "golden staph" and Oro staphira, it is a facultative anaerobic Gram-positive coccal bacterium. It is frequently found as part of the normal skin flora on the skin and nasal passages. It is estimated that 20% of the human population are long-term carriers of S. aureus. S. aureus is the most common species of staphylococcus to cause Staph infections. The reason S. aureus is a successful pathogen is a combination of bacterial immuno-evasive strategies. One of these strategies is the production of carotenoid pigment staphyloxanthin, which is responsible for the characteristic golden colour of S. aureus colonies. This pigment acts as a virulence factor, primarily by being a bacterial antioxidant which helps the microbe evade the reactive oxygen species which the host immune system uses to kill pathogens.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Staphylococcus_aureus_VISA_2.jpg/270px-Staphylococcus_aureus_VISA_2.jpg
