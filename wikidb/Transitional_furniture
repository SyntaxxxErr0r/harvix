2.00	Transitional_furniture	Transitional Style	Transitional Style (also known as “updated classic”, “classic with a contemporary twist”, “new takes on old classics”) in interior design and furniture design refers to a blend of traditional and contemporary styles, midway between old world traditional and the world of chrome and glass contemporary; incorporating lines that are less ornate than traditional designs, but not as severely basic as contemporary lines. As a result transitional furniture designs are classic, timeless, and clean.
