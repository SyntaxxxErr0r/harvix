3.10	Abstract_thinking	Abstraction	Abstraction is a process by which higher concepts are derived from the usage and classification of literal ("real" or "concrete") concepts, first principles, or other methods. "An abstraction" is the product of this process â€“ a concept that acts as a super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a group, field, or category.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/JerryFelix.JPG/125px-JerryFelix.JPG
