1.00	Titanium_tetrabromide	Titanium tetrabromide	Titanium tetrabromide is the chemical compound with the formula TiBr4. It is the most volatile transition metal bromide. The properties of TiBr4 are an average of TiCl4 and TiI4. Some key properties of these four-coordinated Ti(IV) species are their high Lewis acidity and their high solubility in nonpolar organic solvents. TiBr4 is diamagnetic, reflecting the d0 configuration of the metal centre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/TiBr4.png/200px-TiBr4.png
