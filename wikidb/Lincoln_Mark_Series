1.00	Lincoln_Mark_Series	Lincoln Mark series	The Lincoln Mark series is a series of personal luxury cars that have served as the flagship of the Ford Motor Company product line. The series started in 1956 as the newly formed Continental Division introduced a successor to the original Lincoln Continental of 1940-1948. In 1958, the Mark series moved to Lincoln, where it was produced until 1960. In 1968, the Mark series was re-introduced as a personal luxury car, as the Lincoln Continental Mark III. In 1998, the discontinuation of the Mark VIII ended the series. The V8 version of the 2000 Lincoln LS was marketed as its replacement as the market for personal luxury coupes declined in the late 1990s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/1969_Lincoln_Continental_Mark_III.JPG/250px-1969_Lincoln_Continental_Mark_III.JPG
