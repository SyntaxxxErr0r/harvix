102.4	Wireless_access_point	Wireless access point	In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP) is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or related standards. The WAP usually connects to a router (via a wired network), and can relay data between the wireless devices (such as computers or printers) and wired devices on the network.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Linksys_WAP54G.JPG/220px-Linksys_WAP54G.JPG
