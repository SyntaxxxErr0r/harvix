1.00	Scale-inverse-chi-square_distribution	Scaled-inverse-chi-squared distribution	The scaled inverse chi-squared distribution arises in Bayesian statistics. The family of scaled inverse chi-squared distributions contains an extra scaling parameter compared to the inverse-chi-squared distribution. It describes the same data distribution as an inverse gamma distribution, but using a different parametrization, one that may be more convenient for Bayesian statistics. Specifically, the scaled inverse chi-squared distribution can be used as a conjugate prior for the variance parameter of a normal distribution; however, it is more common to use the inverse gamma distribution formulation instead. This distribution is the maximum entropy distribution for a fixed first inverse moment and first logarithmic moment .
