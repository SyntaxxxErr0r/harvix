7.22	Patricia_trie	Radix tree	In computer science, a radix tree (also patricia trie or radix trie) is a space-optimized trie data structure where each node with only one child is merged with its child. The result is that every internal node has at least two children. Unlike in regular tries, edges can be labeled with sequences of characters as well as single characters. This makes them much more efficient for small sets (especially if the strings are long) and for sets of strings that share long prefixes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Patricia_trie.svg/320px-Patricia_trie.svg.png
