2.00	Fremantle_Football_Hall_of_Legends	Fremantle Football Hall of Legends	The Fremantle Football Hall of Legends was inaugurated by the Fremantle Football Club in 1995, in recognition of the new Australian Football League team’s links with its home city’s football heritage. The inductees are nominated by the two clubs from the Fremantle area in the West Australian Football League: East Fremantle and South Fremantle. In time, players who represented Fremantle in the AFL will join their predecessors in this prestigious Hall.
