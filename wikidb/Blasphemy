61.7	Blasphemy	Blasphemy	Blasphemy is irreverence towards religious or holy persons or things. Some countries have laws to punish blasphemy, while others have laws to give recourse to those who are offended by blasphemy. Those laws may discourage blasphemy as a matter of blasphemous libel, vilification of religion, religious insult, or hate speech.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Jesus_graffito.jpg/170px-Jesus_graffito.jpg
