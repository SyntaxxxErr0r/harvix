1.00	%C3%93_Cathain	Ó Catháin	Clan Ó Catháin . The eponymous ancestor of the O'Cahan Clan of Ulster was Catháin, who lived in the 9th century, a descendant of Fergal mac Mael Duin, King of Tara (d. 772), ancestor of the O'Neill Royal dynasty. The O'Cahan line branched off through Fergal's son, Conchobar, and is the senior cadet branch of the O'Neills. Known as "The Warrior Clan of Ulster". The O'Cahan family were under-kings (ur-righ) of the O'Neill dynasty and bore the titles "King of Limavaday, Kianaght, and Fir-na-Creabh" (the latter now the Barony of Coleraine). They also were the hereditary inaugurators of the O'Neill Kings. In Ulster the name is now usually found as O'Kane or Kane in County Londonderry and County Antrim.
