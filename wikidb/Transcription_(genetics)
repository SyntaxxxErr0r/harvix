79.7	Transcription_(genetics)	Transcription (genetics)	In bacteria, transcription begins with the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter in DNA. RNA polymerase is a core enzyme consisting of five subunits: 2 α subunits, 1 β subunit, 1 β' subunit, and 1 ω subunit. At the start of initiation, the core enzyme is associated with a sigma factor that aids in finding the appropriate -35 and -10 base pairs downstream of promoter sequences. When the sigma factor and RNA polymerase combine, they form a holoenzyme.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Simple_transcription_initiation1.svg/400px-Simple_transcription_initiation1.svg.png
