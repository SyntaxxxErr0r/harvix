84.2	Rorschach_(comics)	Rorschach (comics)	Rorschach (born Walter Joseph Kovacs) is a fictional comic book superhero and an antihero of the acclaimed 1986 DC Comics miniseries Watchmen. Rorschach was created by writer Alan Moore with artist Dave Gibbons, but as with most of the central characters in the series, he was an analogue for a Charlton Comics character, in this case Steve Ditko's The Question, and Ditko's small press character Mr. A.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Rorschach.png/175px-Rorschach.png
