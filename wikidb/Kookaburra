53.7	Kookaburra	Kookaburra	Kookaburras (genus Dacelo) are terrestrial kingfishers native to Australia and New Guinea. They are large to very large, with a total length of 28–42 cm (11–17 in). The name is a loanword from Wiradjuri guuguubarra, and is onomatopoeic of its call. The single member of the genus Clytoceyx, though commonly referred to as the Shovel-billed Kookaburra, is not treated in this article.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Dacelo_novaeguineae_waterworks.jpg/300px-Dacelo_novaeguineae_waterworks.jpg
