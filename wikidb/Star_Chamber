102.2	Star_Chamber	Star Chamber	The Star Chamber was an English court of law that sat at the royal Palace of Westminster until 1641. It was made up of Privy Counsellors, as well as common-law judges and supplemented the activities of the common-law and equity courts in both civil and criminal matters. The court was set up to ensure the fair enforcement of laws against prominent people, those so powerful that ordinary courts could never convict them of their crimes. Court sessions were held in secret, with no indictments, no right of appeal, no juries, and no witnesses. Evidence was presented in writing. Over time it evolved into a political weapon, a symbol of the misuse and abuse of power by the English monarchy and courts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281509-1554%29.svg/120px-Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281509-1554%29.svg.png
