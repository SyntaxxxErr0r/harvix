51.3	Acadians	Acadians	The Acadians are the descendants of the 17th-century French colonists who settled in Acadia (located in the Eastern Canada Maritime provinces – Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island – as well as part of Quebec, and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River. Acadia was a colony of New France. Although today most of the Acadians and Québécois are French speaking (francophone) Canadians, Acadia was a distinct colony of New France, and was geographically and administratively separate from the French colony of Canada (modern day Quebec), which led to Acadians and Québécois developing two rather distinct histories and cultures. The settlers whose descendants became Acadians came from "all the regions of France but coming predominantly directly from the cities".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Flag_of_Acadia.svg/220px-Flag_of_Acadia.svg.png
