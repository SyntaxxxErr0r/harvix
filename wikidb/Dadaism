66.4	Dadaism	Dada	Dada ( ) or Dadaism is a cultural movement that began in Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1922. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature—poetry, art manifestoes, art theory—theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Its purpose was to ridicule the meaninglessness of the modern world as its participants saw it. In addition to being anti-war, Dada was also anti-bourgeois and anarchistic in nature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f7/Dada1.jpg/220px-Dada1.jpg
