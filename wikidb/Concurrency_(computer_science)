56.9	Concurrency_(computer_science)	Concurrency (computer science)	In computer science, concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. The computations may be executing on multiple cores in the same chip, preemptively time-shared threads on the same processor, or executed on physically separated processors. A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including Petri nets, process calculi, the Parallel Random Access Machine model, the Actor model and the Reo Coordination Language.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Dining_philosophers.png/200px-Dining_philosophers.png
