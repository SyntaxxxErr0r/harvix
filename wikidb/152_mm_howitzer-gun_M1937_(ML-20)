The gun was developed by the design bureau of the plant no 172, headed by F. F.

The ML-20 saw action in World War II, mainly as a corps / army level artillery piece of the Soviet Army. Captured guns were employed by Wehrmacht and the Finnish Army. Post World War II, the ML-20 saw combat in numerous conflicts during the mid to late twentieth century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/152mm_ml20_hameenlinna_2.jpg/300px-152mm_ml20_hameenlinna_2.jpg
