103.2	Poseidon	Poseidon	Poseidon (Greek: ) was the god of the sea, and, as "Earth-Shaker," of the earthquakes in Greek mythology. The name of the sea-god Nethuns in Etruscan was adopted in Latin for Neptune in Roman mythology: both were sea gods analogous to Poseidon. Linear B tablets show that Poseidon was venerated at Pylos and Thebes in pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, but he was integrated into the Olympian gods as the brother of Zeus and Hades. Poseidon has many children. There is a Homeric hymn to Poseidon, who was the protector of many Hellenic cities, although he lost the contest for Athens to Athena.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/0036MAN_Poseidon.jpg/200px-0036MAN_Poseidon.jpg
