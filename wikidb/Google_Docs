86.5	Google_Docs	Google Docs	Google Docs is a free, Web-based office suite and data storage service offered by Google. It allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating in real-time with other users. Google Docs combines the features of Writely and Spreadsheets with a presentation program incorporating technology designed by Tonic Systems. Data storage of files up to 1 GB total in size was introduced on January 13, 2010, but has since been increased to 10GB, documents using Google Docs native formats do not count towards this quota. The largely anticipated cloud storage feature by Google is said to be replacing most of Docs' features in 2012.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Googlelogo.png/200px-Googlelogo.png
