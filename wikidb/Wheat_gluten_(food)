80.4	Wheat_gluten_(food)	Wheat gluten (food)	Wheat gluten, also called wheat meat, mock duck, gluten meat, or simply gluten, is a food made from gluten, the main protein of wheat. It is made by washing wheat flour dough with water until all the starch dissolves, leaving insoluble gluten as an elastic mass which is then cooked before being eaten.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Seitan.jpg/200px-Seitan.jpg
