120.6	The_Economist	The Economist	The Economist is an English-language weekly news and international affairs publication owned by The Economist Newspaper Ltd. and edited in offices in London. Continuous publication began under founder James Wilson in September 1843. For historical reasons The Economist refers to itself as a newspaper, but each print edition appears on small glossy paper like a news magazine, and its YouTube channel is called EconomistMagazine. For July to December 2010, it reported an average weekly circulation of 1.5 million, above half of which are sold in North America and English speaking countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/71/Acropolis_Now_%28Economist_cover%2C_May_1_2010%29.jpg/220px-Acropolis_Now_%28Economist_cover%2C_May_1_2010%29.jpg
