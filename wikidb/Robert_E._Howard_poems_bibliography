3.30	Robert_E._Howard_poems_bibliography	Robert E. Howard bibliography (poems A-H)	A list of poems by Robert E. Howard (1906â€“1936), an American writer and poet in early 20th century Texas. His love of poetry came from being read to by his mother at a young age. However, his attempts to make a living by poetry were unsuccessful and he is today most remembered for his short stories and fiction. Nevertheless, Howard wrote hundreds of poems; many were published within his lifetime and the others published after his 1936 suicide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Robert_E_Howard_suit.jpg/150px-Robert_E_Howard_suit.jpg
