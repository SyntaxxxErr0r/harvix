13.62	Dragoons	Dragoon	The word dragoon originally meant mounted infantry, who were trained in horse riding as well as infantry fighting skills. However, usage altered over time and during the 18th century, dragoons evolved into conventional light cavalry units and personnel. Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/French_cavalry_prisonners.jpg/300px-French_cavalry_prisonners.jpg
