80.5	North_Rhine-Westphalia	North Rhine-Westphalia	Around 1 A.D. there were numerous incursions through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent Roman or Romanized settlements. The Battle of Teutoburg Forest took place near Osnabrück (as mentioned, it is disputed whether this is in Westphalia) and some of the tribes who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia. Charlemagne is thought to have spent considerable time in Paderborn and nearby parts. His Saxon Wars also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary Widukind to places near Detmold, Bielefeld, Lemgo, Osnabrück and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in Enger, which is also a subject of a legend.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Flag_of_North_Rhine-Westphalia.svg/120px-Flag_of_North_Rhine-Westphalia.svg.png
