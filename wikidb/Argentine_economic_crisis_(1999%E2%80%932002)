52.4	Argentine_economic_crisis_(1999%E2%80%932002)	Argentine economic crisis (1999â€“2002)	The Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) was a dire financial downturn that affected Argentina's economy during the late 1990s and the early years of the 2000s. In macroeconomical terms, the critical period started with the decrease of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1999 and ended in 2002 with a return to GDP growth . However, the origins of the collapse, as well as the effects upon the country's residents, can be traced back to earlier economic and political decisions that were reportedly of a questionable nature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/De_la_Rua_renuncia.JPG/260px-De_la_Rua_renuncia.JPG
