55.7	Atrial_fibrillation	Atrial fibrillation	Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heart beat). It may cause no symptoms, but it is often associated with palpitations, fainting, chest pain, or congestive heart failure. AF increases the risk of stroke; the degree of stroke risk can be up to seven times that of the average population, depending on the presence of additional risk factors (such as high blood pressure). It may be identified clinically when taking a pulse, and the presence of AF can be confirmed with an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) which demonstrates the absence of P waves together with an irregular ventricular rate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/SinusRhythmLabels.svg/230px-SinusRhythmLabels.svg.png
