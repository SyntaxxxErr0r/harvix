23.63	Universal_Camouflage_Pattern	Universal Camouflage Pattern	The Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), also referred to as ACUPAT (Army Combat Uniform PATtern) or Digital Camouflage ("digicam") is the military camouflage pattern currently in use in the United States Army's Army Combat Uniform. The pattern was chosen after several laboratory and field tests that occurred from 2003 to 2004. Its digital pattern is a modification of the United States Marine Corps' MARPAT camouflage and research into Dual Texture (Dual-Tex) Camouflage conducted in the 1970s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Army_Combat_Uniform.jpg/220px-Army_Combat_Uniform.jpg
