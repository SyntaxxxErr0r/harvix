2.00	Pentagrammaton	Yahshuah	Yahshuah is a form of the Hebrew name of Jesus produced by mystical speculation at various periods of history, but which is rejected by mainstream linguistics and textual scholarship in the field of ancient languages. The essential idea is of an alphabetic consonantal framework Y-H-Sh-W-H, which can be supplied with vowels in various ways.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Pentagrammaton.jpg
