72.5	Trofim_Lysenko	Trofim Lysenko	Trofim Denisovich Lysenko (Russian: , Ukrainian: , Trochym Denysovyč Lysenko) (September 29 1898 – November 20, 1976) was a Soviet pseudoscientist of Ukrainian origin, who was director of Soviet biology under Joseph Stalin. Lysenko rejected Mendelian genetics in favor of the hybridization theories of Russian horticulturist Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, and adopted them into a powerful political-scientific movement termed Lysenkoism. Today, much of Lysenko's agricultural experimentation and research is largely viewed as fraudulent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Lysenko_in_field_with_wheat.jpg/150px-Lysenko_in_field_with_wheat.jpg
