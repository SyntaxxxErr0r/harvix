156.4	Uncanny_Valley	Uncanny valley	The uncanny valley is a hypothesis in the field of robotics and 3D computer animation, which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers. The "valley" in question is a dip in a proposed graph of the positivity of human reaction as a function of a robot's human likeness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Repliee_Q2.jpg/200px-Repliee_Q2.jpg
