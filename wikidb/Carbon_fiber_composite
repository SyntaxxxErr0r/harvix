3.00	Carbon_fiber_composite	Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer	Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer or carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic , is a very strong and light fiber-reinforced polymer which contains carbon fibers. The polymer is most often epoxy, but other polymers, such as polyester, vinyl ester or nylon, are sometimes used. The composite may contain other fibers, such as Kevlar, aluminium, or glass fibers, as well as carbon fiber. The strongest and most expensive of these additives, carbon nanotubes, are contained in some primarily polymer baseball bats, car parts and even golf clubs where economically viable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Cfk_heli_slw.jpg/220px-Cfk_heli_slw.jpg
