1.21	Lowell_D._Holmes_Museum_of_Anthropology	Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology	Martinâ€™s concept was to have the museum essentially run and operated by students as part of their museum studies training. He raised funds to hire student staff to run the day-to-day operations of the museum under his supervision. As of the fall semester of 2006, the museum has the funds to hire five student positions. The museum has a wide range of functions. It has exhibitions open to the public, houses a rapidly expanding collection, a support unit for the anthropology department and faculty of Wichita State University, a research facility for students, a repository for United States Government archaeological collections, and the basis for a growing museum studies program. These different functions provide a very wide range of experience for the student staff.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Fumerimage.jpg/220px-Fumerimage.jpg
