1.10	G.E.V.	Ogre (game)	Ogre is a board wargame first released in 1977 as the first Metagaming Concepts Microgame, designed by Steve Jackson. Its basic premise is that it is an asymmetric-forces game set in the late 21st century. One player has a single giant robot tank (called an "Ogre") pitted against a second player's headquarters, defended by a mixture of conventional tanks, infantry, and artillery. The concept was strongly influenced by Keith Laumer's novel Bolo (1976), and Colin Kapp's short story "Gottlos" (1969). The Ogre itself is named after the large and strong mythological beast ogre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/Ogre_microgame.jpg
