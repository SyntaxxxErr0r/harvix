3.10	Binary_scaling	Binary scaling	Binary scaling is a computer programming technique used mainly by embedded C, DSP and assembler programmers to perform a pseudo floating point using integer arithmetic. It is both faster and more accurate than directly using floating point instructions, however care must be taken not to cause an arithmetic overflow.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Binary_angles.svg/360px-Binary_angles.svg.png
