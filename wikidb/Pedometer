51.6	Pedometer	Pedometer	A pedometer is a device, usually portable and electronic or electromechanical, that counts each step a person takes by detecting the motion of the person's hips. Because the distance of each person's step varies, an informal calibration, performed by the user, is required if presentation of the distance covered in a unit of length (such as in kilometres or miles) is desired.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Omron_HJ112.jpg/220px-Omron_HJ112.jpg
