52.7	Taqiyya	Taqiyya	Taqiyya (alternate spellings taqiya, taqiyah, tuqyah), meaning religious dissimulation, is a practice emphasized in Shi'a Islam whereby adherents may conceal their religion when they are under threat, persecution, or compulsion. This means a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are under those risks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Basmala.svg/130px-Basmala.svg.png
