8.00	King_Zhou_of_Shang	King Zhou of Shang	King Zhou was the pejorative posthumous name given to Di Xin (Chinese: ; pinyin: Dì Xīn), the last king of the Shang Dynasty of ancient China. He is also called Zhou Xin (紂辛; Zhòu Xīn). He may also be referred to by adding "Shang" (商 Shāng) in front of any of his names. Note that Zhou (紂) is a completely different character from the "Zhou" (周) used by the succeeding Zhou Dynasty. In Chinese, 紂 also refers to a horse crupper, the part of a saddle or harness most likely to be soiled by the horse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/FengShen.jpg/250px-FengShen.jpg
