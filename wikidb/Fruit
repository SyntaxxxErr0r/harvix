178.3	Fruit	Fruit	In botany, a fruit is a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower, mainly one or more ovaries. Fruits are the means by which many plants disseminate seeds. Many plants bearing edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition, respectively; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Fruit_Stall_in_Barcelona_Market.jpg/220px-Fruit_Stall_in_Barcelona_Market.jpg
