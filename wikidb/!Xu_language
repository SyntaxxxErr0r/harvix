3.00	!Xu_language	!Kung language	!Kung or !Xun, also called Ju, is a dialect continuum (language complex) spoken in Namibia, Botswana, and Angola by the !Kung people. Together with the Ç‚Hoan language, it forms the proposed Kx'a language family. !Kung constituted one of the branches of the putative Khoisan language family, and was called Northern Khoisan in that scenario, but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is suspected to be spurious. Nonetheless, the term "Khoisan" is widely retained as a convenience.
