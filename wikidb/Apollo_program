135.0	Apollo_program	Apollo program	The Apollo program was the spaceflight effort carried out by the United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), that landed the first humans on Earth's Moon. Conceived during the Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Apollo began in earnest after President John F. Kennedy proposed the national goal of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" by the end of the 1960s in a May 25, 1961 address to Congress.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Apollo_program_insignia.png/240px-Apollo_program_insignia.png
