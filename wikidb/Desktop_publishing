70.8	Desktop_publishing	Desktop publishing	Desktop publishing (abbreviated DTP) is the creation of printed materials using page layout software on a personal computer. When used skilfully, desktop publishing can produce printed literature with attractive layouts and typographic quality comparable to traditional typography and printing. This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide range of printed matter—from menus and local newsletters to books, magazines, and newspapers—without the sometimes-prohibitive expense of commercial printing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Scribus-1.3-Linux.png/300px-Scribus-1.3-Linux.png
