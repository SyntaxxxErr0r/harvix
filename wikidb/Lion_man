13.60	Lion_man	Lion man of the Hohlenstein Stadel	A lion-headed figure, first called the lion man (German: , literally "lion person"), then the lion lady (German: ), is an ivory sculpture that is the oldest known zoomorphic (animal-shaped) sculpture in the world and one of the oldest known sculptures in general. The sculpture has also been interpreted as anthropomorphic, giving human characteristics to an animal, although it may have represented a deity. The figurine was determined to be about 32,000 years old by carbon dating material from the same layer in which the sculpture was found. It is associated with the archaeological Aurignacian culture. The sculpture is 29.6 cm (11.7 inches) in height, 5.6 cm wide, and 5.9 cm thick. It was carved out of mammoth ivory using a flint stone knife. There are seven parallel, transverse, carved gouges on the left arm. It is now in the museum in Ulm, Germany.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Lion_man_photo.jpg/200px-Lion_man_photo.jpg
