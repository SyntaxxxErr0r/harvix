1.10	Kendal_Green_(MBTA_station)	Kendal Green (MBTA station)	Kendal Green is a passenger rail station on MBTA Commuter Rail's Fitchburg Line in Weston, Massachusetts. It has 2 tracks with 1 platform on the outbound side. Inbound passengers board via an asphalt patch that crosses the outbound tracks from the platform. There is free parking across the street from the station. At certain times, the station is a flag stop, meaning the engineer will only stop the train in the case that they can see a waiting passenger.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Kendalgreen7.jpg/300px-Kendalgreen7.jpg
