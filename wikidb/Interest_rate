62.9	Interest_rate	Interest rate	An interest rate is the rate at which interest is paid by a borrower for the use of money that they borrow from a lender. For example, a small company borrows capital from a bank to buy new assets for their business, and in return the lender receives interest at a predetermined interest rate for deferring the use of funds and instead lending it to the borrower. Interest rates are normally expressed as a percentage of the principal for a period of one year.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/German_bank_interest_rates_from_1967_to_2003_grid.svg/220px-German_bank_interest_rates_from_1967_to_2003_grid.svg.png
