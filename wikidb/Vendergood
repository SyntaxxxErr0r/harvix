3.00	Vendergood	William James Sidis	William James Sidis was an American child prodigy with exceptional mathematical and linguistic abilities. His IQ was estimated to be between 250 and 300 (measures of IQ have changed over time since then) - one of the highest ever recorded - he entered Harvard early at age 11, and as an adult it was claimed he was conversant in over 40 languages and dialects. However it was later acknowledged that some of these estimations about Sidis and his intelligence were only exaggerations. He became famous first for his precocity, and later for his eccentricity and withdrawal from the public eye. He avoided mathematics entirely in later life, writing on other subjects under a number of pseudonyms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/William_James_Sidis_1914.jpg/220px-William_James_Sidis_1914.jpg
