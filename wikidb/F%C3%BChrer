42.38	F%C3%BChrer	Führer	Führer , alternatively spelled Fuehrer in both English and German when the umlaut is not available, is a German title meaning leader or guide now most associated with Adolf Hitler. The word Führer in the sense of guide remains common in German, but because of its strong association with Nazi Germany, it comes with some stigma and negative connotations when used as the meaning of leader. The word Leiter is therefore used instead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Standarte_Adolf_Hitlers.svg/120px-Standarte_Adolf_Hitlers.svg.png
