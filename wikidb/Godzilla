137.9	Godzilla	Godzilla	With the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Daigo FukuryÅ« Maru incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a monster created by nuclear detonations and a metaphor for nuclear weapons in general. As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones portraying Godzilla as a hero while other plots still portrayed him as a destructive monster.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Godzilla_collage.jpg
