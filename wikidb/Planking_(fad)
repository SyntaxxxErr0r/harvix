Both hands must touch the sides of the body and having a photograph of the participant taken and posted on the Internet is an integral part of the game. Players compete to find the most unusual and original location in which to play. The term planking refers to mimicking a wooden plank. Rigidity of the body must be maintained to constitute good planking.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Playing_The_Lying_Down_Game_at_the_geohash.jpg/200px-Playing_The_Lying_Down_Game_at_the_geohash.jpg
