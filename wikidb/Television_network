Until the mid-1980s, television programming in most countries of the world was dominated by a small number of broadcast networks. Many early television networks (e.g. the BBC, NBC or CBS) evolved from earlier radio networks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/DuMont_Affiliates_1949.png/300px-DuMont_Affiliates_1949.png
