10.33	Gedankenexperiment	Thought experiment	A thought experiment or Gedankenexperiment (from German) considers some hypothesis, theory, or principle for the purpose of thinking through its consequences. Given the structure of the experiment, it may or may not be possible to actually perform it, and, in the case that it is possible for it to be performed, there need be no intention of any kind to actually perform the experiment in question. The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Schrodingers_cat.svg/250px-Schrodingers_cat.svg.png
