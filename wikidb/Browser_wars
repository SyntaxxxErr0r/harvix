249.6	Browser_wars	Browser wars	Browser wars is a metaphorical term that refers to competitions for dominance in usage share in the web browser marketplace. The term is often used to denote two specific rivalries: the competition that saw Microsoft's Internet Explorer replace Netscape's Navigator as the dominant browser during the late 1990s and the erosion of Internet Explorer's market share since 2003 by a collection of emerging browsers including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Timeline_of_web_browsers.svg/220px-Timeline_of_web_browsers.svg.png
