62.6	Santa_Ana_winds	Santa Ana winds	The Santa Ana winds are strong, extremely dry offshore winds that affect coastal Southern California and northern Baja California in autumn and winter. They can range from hot to cold, depending on the prevailing temperatures in the source regions, the Great Basin and upper Mojave Desert. The winds are known for the hot dry weather (often the hottest of the year) that they bring in the fall, and are infamous for fanning regional wildfires.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/PIA03445.jpg/300px-PIA03445.jpg
