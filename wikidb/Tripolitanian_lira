1.00	Tripolitanian_lira	Tripolitanian lira	The lira was the military currency of the British zone of occupation (later Mandate Territory) in Libya between 1943 and 1951. It was issued by the "Military Authority in Tripolitania", known popularly as "MAL" and circulated together with the Italian lira at par. This situation reflected that of Italy, where the AM-lira was minted by the United States. The Tripolitanian and the Italian lira were replaced in 1951 by the Libyan pound at a rate of 1 pound = 480 lire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/5_Tripolitanian_lira_note.jpg/220px-5_Tripolitanian_lira_note.jpg
