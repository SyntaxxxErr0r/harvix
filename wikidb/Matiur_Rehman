4.00	Matiur_Rehman	Matiur Rehman	Matiur Rehman (born 1977) is a Pakistani militant who has been identified as al Qaeda's planning director. He was thought to have frequent contacts with Ayman al-Zawahiri and to be in contact with Rashid Rauf. It was suggested at one point that Rehman and Rauf were one and the same, but this was dismissed by officials in Britain and Pakistan. Rehman was linked by Pakistani officials with the 2006 plot to destroy aircraft using homemade "liquid explosive" devices.
