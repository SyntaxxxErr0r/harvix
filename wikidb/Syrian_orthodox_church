The Syriac Orthodox Church claims to derive its origin from one of the first Christian communities, established in Antioch by the Apostle St. Peter. It employs the oldest surviving liturgy in Christianity, the Liturgy of St. James the Apostle, and uses Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic spoken by Jesus Christ and his Apostles, as its official and liturgical language. The church is led by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Syriac_orthodox_COA.svg/200px-Syriac_orthodox_COA.svg.png
