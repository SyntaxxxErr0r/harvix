2.00	Metapsychology	Metapsychology	Metapsychology (Greek: meta, "beyond, transcending", and ψυχολογία, "psychology") is the philosophical study of psychology. Metapsychology, a speculative psychology, is a systematic attempt to discern and describe what lies beyond the facts and laws of psychology, such as the relations between body and mind or concerning the place of the mind in the universe. Psychoanalytic metapsychology is concerned with the fundamental assumptions of the Freudian theory. The modern metapsychology movement was founded by psychiatrist Frank A. Gerbode.
