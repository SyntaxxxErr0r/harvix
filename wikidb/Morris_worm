It is considered the first worm and was certainly the first to gain significant mainstream media attention. It also resulted in the first conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It was written by a student at Cornell University, Robert Tappan Morris, and launched on November 2, 1988 from MIT.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Morris_Worm.jpg/180px-Morris_Worm.jpg
