222.7	All_your_base_are_belong_to_us	All your base are belong to us	"All your base are belong to us" (often shortened to "All Your Base", "AYBABTU", or simply "AYB") is a broken English phrase that is an Internet phenomenon or meme. The text comes from the opening cutscene of the 1991 European Sega Mega Drive version of the video game Zero Wing by Toaplan, which was poorly translated from Japanese.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Aybabtu.png
