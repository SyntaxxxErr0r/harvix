8.21	Bullseye_(shooting_competition)	Bullseye (shooting competition)	Bullseye, also known as conventional pistol, is a shooting sport in which participants shoot handguns at paper targets at fixed distances and time limits. A number of organizations, including the NRA and Civilian Marksmanship Program in the United States, have established rules and keep records for these sports. Emphasis is on accuracy and precision. The sport is primarily popular in United States and Canada. Bullseye pistol was the inspiration for the ISSF international 25 m Standard Pistol (82 feet) event and like the ISSF pistol events, the development of skills required to shoot one-handed at 5.5-inch and 8-inch bullseye targets at 25 and 50 yards, respectively, takes considerable training to achieve proficiency.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Nra-b3-targ-kimber-raptor.jpg/260px-Nra-b3-targ-kimber-raptor.jpg
