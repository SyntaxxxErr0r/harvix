1.00	Fledging	Fledge	Fledge is the stage in a young bird's life when the feathers and wing muscles are sufficiently developed for flight. It also describes the act of a chick's parents raising it to a fully grown state. A young bird that has recently fledged but is still dependent upon parental care and feeding is called a fledgling.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Common_Myna_Fledgling.jpg/220px-Common_Myna_Fledgling.jpg
