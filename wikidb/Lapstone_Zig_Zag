3.10	Lapstone_Zig_Zag	Lapstone Zig Zag	The Lapstone Zig Zag was a zig zag railway built near Lapstone on the Great Western Railway of New South Wales in Australia between 1863 and 1865, to overcome an otherwise insurmountable climb up the eastern side of the Blue Mountains. The ruling grade was already very steep at 1 in 33 (3%). The original plan had been to build the whole line across the Blue Mountains on a completely different route through the Grose Valley with a 3 km long tunnel, but this was beyond the resources of the state of New South Wales at the time. The track included a now abandoned station called Lucasville which was built for the Minister for Mines, John Lucas who had a holiday home nearby.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Knapsack_Viaduct.jpg/220px-Knapsack_Viaduct.jpg
