77.8	Loss_aversion	Loss aversion	In economics and decision theory, loss aversion refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Some studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains. Loss aversion was first convincingly demonstrated by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Daniel_KAHNEMAN.jpg
