112.6	Lightbox_(JavaScript)	Lightbox (JavaScript)	Lightbox, is a JavaScript technique used to display large images using modal dialogs. The effect has gained widespread popularity due to its simple yet elegant style and easy implementation. Some of the first implementations did not use any libraries, many now use a number of JavaScript libraries (such as the Prototype Javascript Framework and script.aculo.us for its animations and positioning), in order to reduce the size of the code. The release of Lightbox encouraged other developers to work on similar projects, resulting in products such as the later Thickbox (no longer maintained) and lighter Slimbox.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Lightbox2.png/225px-Lightbox2.png
