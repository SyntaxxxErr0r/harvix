As a token of good will, Prince Yuri ceded three of his Karelian parishes to Sweden; Sweden would in turn stay out of any conflict between Novgorod and Narva. Both sides would also promise to refrain from building castles on the new border.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Treaty-of-N%C3%B6teborg.png/300px-Treaty-of-N%C3%B6teborg.png
