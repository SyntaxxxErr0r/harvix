54.8	Emory_University	Emory University	Emory University is a private research university in metropolitan Atlanta, located in the Druid Hills section of unincorporated DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The university was founded as Emory College in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia by a small group of Methodists and was named in honor of Methodist bishop John Emory. A land-grant by Asa Candler, the president of The Coca-Cola Company, allowed the small college to move to metropolitan Atlanta in 1915 and become rechartered as Emory University. The university's mission statement is "to create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Emory_University_Seal.png/220px-Emory_University_Seal.png
