24.37	Platte_River	Platte River	The Platte River ( ) is a major river in the state of Nebraska and is about 310 mi (500 km) long. Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River, it flows for over 1,050 miles (1,690 km). The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River, which in turn is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Platte over most of its length is a muddy, broad, shallow, meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islandsâ€”a braided stream. These characteristics made it too difficult even for canoe travel, and it was never used as a major transportation route by European-American trappers or explorers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Platte_River.jpg/256px-Platte_River.jpg
