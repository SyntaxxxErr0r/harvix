He is the ace linebacker of the Ojo White Knights American football team and Sena Kobayakawa's main rival. Shin is a silent, seemingly unsociable person. Despite this, his friends include his teammates Haruto Sakuraba and Makoto Otawara. After the Ojo's coach, Shoji Gunpei, noticed his talent when he first tried out for the Ojo American football team with Sakuraba, he told the seniors to make sure Shin never gets recruited by any other club than the American football club.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/Seijuro-Shin.jpg/175px-Seijuro-Shin.jpg
