76.8	Mining	Mining	Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, from an ore body, vein or seam. The term also includes the removal of soil. Materials recovered by mining include base metals, precious metals, iron, uranium, coal, diamonds, limestone, oil shale, rock salt and potash. Any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or created artificially in a laboratory or factory, is usually mined. Mining in a wider sense comprises extraction of any non-renewable resource (e.g., petroleum, natural gas, or even water).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Simplified_world_mining_map_2.png/500px-Simplified_world_mining_map_2.png
