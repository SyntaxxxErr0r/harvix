The term "amateur" is used to specify persons interested in radio technique solely with a personal aim and without pecuniary interest, and to differentiate it from commercial broadcasting, public safety (such as police and fire), or professional two-way radio services (such as maritime, aviation, taxis, etc.).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Amateurfunkstation.jpg/220px-Amateurfunkstation.jpg
