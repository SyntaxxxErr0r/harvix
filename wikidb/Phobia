51.6	Phobia	Phobia	It is possible for an individual to develop a phobia over virtually anything. The name of a phobia generally contains a Greek word for what the patient fears plus the suffix -phobia. Creating these terms is something of a word game. Few of these terms are found in medical literature. However, this does not necessarily make it a non-psychological condition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cc/PTSD_stress_brain.gif/220px-PTSD_stress_brain.gif
