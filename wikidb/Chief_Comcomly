1.10	Chief_Comcomly	Chief Comcomly	Chief Comcomly or Concomly (1765 â€“ 1830) was a Native American chief of the Chinookan people. He was the principal chief of the Chinook Confederacy, which extended along the Columbia River from the Cascade Range to the Pacific Ocean. Washington Irving described him in his book Astoria as "a shrewd old savage with but one eye". He was friendly to the White explorers whom he encountered, and received medals from Lewis and Clark. He also assisted the Astor Expedition and offered to help the Americans fight the British during the War of 1812, but Astoria was sold to the British instead. Comcomly was friendly with the British as well. He was entertained at Fort Vancouver by John McLoughlin and he piloted Hudson's Bay Company ships up the Columbia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/Comcomly%27s_tomb.jpg/220px-Comcomly%27s_tomb.jpg
