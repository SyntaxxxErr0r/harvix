Her influence was so great that she has been referred to as "The Uncrowned Queen." Her immediate contemporary was Madame de Montespan, mistress of King Louis XIV of France.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Barbara_Palmer_%28n%C3%A9e_Villiers%29%2C_Duchess_of_Cleveland_by_Sir_Peter_Lely.jpg/220px-Barbara_Palmer_%28n%C3%A9e_Villiers%29%2C_Duchess_of_Cleveland_by_Sir_Peter_Lely.jpg
