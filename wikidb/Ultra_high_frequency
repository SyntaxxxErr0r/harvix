69.7	Ultra_high_frequency	Ultra high frequency	Ultra-high frequency (UHF) designates the ITU radio frequency range of electromagnetic waves between 300 MHz and 3 GHz (3,000 MHz), also known as the decimetre band or decimetre wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten decimetres (10 cm to 1 metre). Radio waves with frequencies above the UHF band fall into the SHF and EHF (extremely high frequency) bands, all of which fall into the microwave frequency range. Lower frequency signals fall into the VHF (very high frequency) or lower bands. See Electromagnetic spectrum and Radio spectrum for a full listing of frequency bands.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Primary_Network_Affiliates_May_1954.png/220px-Primary_Network_Affiliates_May_1954.png
