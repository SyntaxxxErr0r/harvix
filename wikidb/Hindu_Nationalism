1.01	Hindu_Nationalism	Hindu nationalism	Hindu nationalism (Hindi: हिंदू राष्ट्रवाद, Bengali: হিন্দু জাতীয়তাবাদ, Kannada: ಹಿಂದು ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರವಾದ) has been collectively referred to as the expressions of social and political thought, based on the native spiritual and cultural traditions of historical India. Some scholars have argued that the use of the term "Hindu nationalism" to refer to is a simplistic translation and is better described by the term "Hindu polity".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Raja_Ram_Mohan_Roy.jpg
