7.21	Lick_me_in_the_ass	Leck mich im Arsch	Leck mich im Arsch (literally "Lick me in the arse") is a canon in B-flat major composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, K. 231 (K. 382c), with lyrics in German. It was one of a set of at least six canons probably written in Vienna in 1782. Sung by six voices as a three-part round, it is thought to be a party piece for his friends.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart_1.jpg/220px-Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart_1.jpg
