56.1	Multiplexing	Multiplexing	In wired communication, space-division multiplexing simply implies different point-to-point wires for different channels. Examples include an analogue stereo audio cable, with one pair of wires for the left channel and another for the right channel, and a multipair telephone cable. Another example is a switched star network such as the analog telephone access network (although inside the telephone exchange or between the exchanges, other multiplexing techniques are typically employed) or a switched Ethernet network. A third example is a mesh network. Wired space-division multiplexing is typically not considered as multiplexing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Multipexing_demultiplexing_scheme_en.svg/500px-Multipexing_demultiplexing_scheme_en.svg.png
