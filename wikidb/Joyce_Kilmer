59.8	Joyce_Kilmer	Joyce Kilmer	Alfred Joyce Kilmer (December 6, 1886 â€“ July 30, 1918) was an American journalist, poet, literary critic, lecturer, and editor. Though a prolific poet whose works celebrated the common beauty of the natural world as well as his religious faith, Kilmer is remembered most for a short poem titled "Trees" (1913), which was published in the collection Trees and Other Poems in 1914. While most of his works are unknown, a select few of his poems remain popular and are published frequently in anthologies. Several critics, both Kilmer's contemporaries and modern scholars, disparaged Kilmer's work as being too simple, overly sentimental, and suggested that his style was far too traditional, even archaic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Joyce_Kilmer.jpg/170px-Joyce_Kilmer.jpg
