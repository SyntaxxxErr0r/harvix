72.2	Complex_adaptive_system	Complex adaptive system	Complex adaptive systems are special cases of complex systems. They are complex in that they are dynamic networks of interactions and relationships not aggregations of static entities. They are adaptive in that their individual and collective behaviour changes as a result of experience.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Evolution_of_complexity.svg/300px-Evolution_of_complexity.svg.png
