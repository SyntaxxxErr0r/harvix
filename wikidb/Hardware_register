13.11	Hardware_register	Hardware register	In digital electronics, especially computing, a hardware register stores bits of information, in a way that all the bits can be written to or read out simultaneously. The hardware registers inside a central processing unit (CPU) are called processor registers. Signals from a state machine to the register control when registers transmit to or accept information from other registers. Sometimes the state machine routes information from one register through a functional transform, such as an adder unit, and then to another register that stores the results.
