3.30	Inge_II_of_Norway	Inge II of Norway	Inge Baardson (1185 – 23 April 1217) was king of Norway from 1204 to 1217. His reign was within the later stages of the period known in Norwegian history as the age of civil wars. Inge was the king of the birkebeiner faction. The conclusion of the settlement of Kvitsøy with the bagler faction in 1208 led to peace for the last nine years of Inge’s reigns, at the price of Inge and the birkebeiner recognising bagler rule over Viken (the Oslofjord-area).
