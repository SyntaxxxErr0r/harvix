55.7	Malignant	Malignancy	Malignancy (from Malign from Latin roots male "badly" + -gnus "born") is the tendency of a medical condition, especially tumors, to become progressively worse and to potentially result in death. Malignancy in cancers is characterized by anaplasia, invasiveness, and metastasis. Malignant is a corresponding adjectival medical term used to describe a severe and progressively worsening disease. The term is most familiar as a description of cancer.

Malignant tumor is synonymous with cancer. Uses of "malignant" in oncology:
