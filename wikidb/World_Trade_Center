The complex opened on April 4, 1973, and was destroyed in 2001 during the September 11 attacks. The site is being rebuilt with five new skyscrapers and a memorial to the casualties of the attacks. As of November 2011 , only one skyscraper has been completed, with four more expected to be completed before 2020. One World Trade Center will be the lead building for the new complex and is expected to be finished by 2013. A sixth tower is still awaiting confirmation to be built.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Wtc_arial_march2001.jpg/240px-Wtc_arial_march2001.jpg
