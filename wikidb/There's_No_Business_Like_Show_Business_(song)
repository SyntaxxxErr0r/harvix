13.34	There's_No_Business_Like_Show_Business_(song)	There's No Business Like Show Business	"There's No Business Like Show Business" is an Irving Berlin song, written for the musical Annie Get Your Gun and orchestrated by Ted Royal. The song, a slightly tongue-in-cheek salute to the glamor and excitement of a life in show business, is sung in the musical by members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in an attempt to persuade Annie Oakley to join the Wild West Show. It is reprised three times in the musical.
