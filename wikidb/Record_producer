180.8	Record_producer	Record producer	A record producer is an individual working within the music industry, whose job is to oversee and manage the recording (i.e. "production") of an artist's music. A producer has many roles that may include, but are not limited to, gathering ideas for the project, selecting songs and/or musicians, coaching the artist and musicians in the studio, controlling the recording sessions, and supervising the entire process through mixing and mastering. Producers also often take on a wider entrepreneurial role, with responsibility for the budget, schedules, and negotiations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Engineer_at_audio_console_at_Danish_Broadcasting_Corporation.png/250px-Engineer_at_audio_console_at_Danish_Broadcasting_Corporation.png
