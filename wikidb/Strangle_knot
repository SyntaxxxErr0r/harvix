1.00	Strangle_knot	Strangle knot	The strangle knot is a simple binding knot. Similar to the constrictor knot, it also features an overhand knot under a riding turn. The difference is that the ends emerge at the outside edges, rather than between the turns as for a constrictor. This knot is actually a rearranged double overhand knot and makes up each half of the double fisherman's knot.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Strangle-knot-ABOK-1239.jpg/250px-Strangle-knot-ABOK-1239.jpg
