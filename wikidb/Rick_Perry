139.6	Rick_Perry	Rick Perry	James Richard "Rick" Perry (born March 4, 1950) is the 47th and current Governor of Texas. Perry, a Republican, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1998 and assumed the governorship in December 2000 when then-governor George W. Bush resigned to become President of the United States. Perry was elected to full gubernatorial terms in 2002, 2006 and 2010. With a tenure in office to date of 11 years, 101 days, Perry is the longest continuously serving current U.S. governor, and the second longest serving current U.S. governorâ€”after Terry Branstad of Iowa. Perry served as Chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2008 (succeeding Sonny Perdue of Georgia) and again in 2011. Perry is the longest serving governor in Texas state history. As a result, he is the only governor in modern Texas history to have appointed at least one person to every eligible state office, board, or commission position (as well as to several elected offices to which the governor can appoint someone to fill an unexpired term, such as six of the nine current members of the Texas Supreme Court).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Rick_Perry_by_Gage_Skidmore_4.jpg/220px-Rick_Perry_by_Gage_Skidmore_4.jpg
