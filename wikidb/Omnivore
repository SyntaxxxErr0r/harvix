62.3	Omnivore	Omnivore	Omnivores (from Latin: omni, meaning "all, everything"; vorare, "to devour") are species that eat both plants and animal material as their primary food source. They often are opportunistic, general feeders not specifically adapted to eating and digesting either meat or plant material primarily. Many depend on a suitable mix of animal and plant food for long-term good health and reproduction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Corvus_corax_%28FWS%29.jpg/220px-Corvus_corax_%28FWS%29.jpg
