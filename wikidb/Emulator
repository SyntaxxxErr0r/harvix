72.9	Emulator	Emulator	In computing, an emulator is hardware or software or both that duplicates (or emulates) the functions of a first computer system (the guest) in a different second computer system (the host), so that the emulated behavior closely resembles the behavior of the real system. This focus on exact reproduction of behavior is in contrast to some other forms of computer simulation, in which an abstract model of a system is being simulated. For example, a computer simulation of a hurricane or a chemical reaction is not emulation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/DOSBox_screenshot.png/275px-DOSBox_screenshot.png
