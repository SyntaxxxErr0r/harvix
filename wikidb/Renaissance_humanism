54.3	Renaissance_humanism	Renaissance humanism	Renaissance humanism was an activity of cultural and educational reform engaged by scholars, writers, and civic leaders who are today known as Renaissance humanists. It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, and was a response to the challenge of Medi√¶val scholastic education, emphasizing practical, pre-professional and -scientific studies. Scholasticism focused on preparing men to be doctors, lawyers or professional theologians, and was taught from approved textbooks in logic, natural philosophy, medicine, law and theology. The main centers of humanism were Florence and Naples.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/HumanismSymbol.svg/120px-HumanismSymbol.svg.png
