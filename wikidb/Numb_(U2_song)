4.01	Numb_(U2_song)	Numb (U2 song)	"Numb" is a song by rock band U2. It is the third track from their 1993 album Zooropa and was released in June 1993 as the album's first single. The song features a monotonous mantra of "don't" commands spoken by guitarist The Edge amidst a backdrop of various sound effects and samples. The noisy composition and lyrical concept for "Numb" were inspired by the theme of sensory overload, which had prominently been incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour. U2 lead vocalist Bono and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. provided backing vocals on the track.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/U2numb.jpg/220px-U2numb.jpg
