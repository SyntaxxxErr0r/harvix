It is used mainly as an entheogen, recreational drug, and as an agent in psychedelic therapy. LSD is non-addictive, is not known to cause brain damage, and has extremely low toxicity relative to dose, although in rare cases adverse psychiatric reactions such as anxiety or delusions are possible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/LSD-2D-skeletal-formula-and-3D-models.png/350px-LSD-2D-skeletal-formula-and-3D-models.png
