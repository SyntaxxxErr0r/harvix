1.00	U.S._Route_180_(Arizona)	U.S. Route 180	U.S. Route 180 is an eastâ€“west United States highway. Like many three-digit routes, US 180 no longer meets its "parent", US 80. US 80 was decommissioned west of Mesquite, Texas, and was replaced in Texas by Interstate 20 and Interstate 10. The highway's eastern terminus is in Hudson Oaks, Texas, (west of Fort Worth, near Weatherford) at an intersection with Interstate 20. Its western terminus is unclear. Signage at an intersection with State Route 64 in Tusayan, Arizona 40 miles (64 km) northwest of Flagstaff indicates that the route ends at SR 64, which is consistent with the AASHTO U.S. Highway logs. However, many maps continue the US 180 designation to the south rim of the Grand Canyon at Grand Canyon Village.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/US_180_map.png/290px-US_180_map.png
