1.00	Safe_As_Milk	Safe as Milk	Safe as Milk is the début album by Captain Beefheart &amp; his Magic Band, originally released in 1967. It is a heavily blues-influenced work, but also hints at many of the features—such as surreal lyrics and odd time signatures—that would later become trademarks of Beefheart's music.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/Safe_as_Milk.jpg/220px-Safe_as_Milk.jpg
