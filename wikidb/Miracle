108.0	Miracle	Miracle	A miracle often denotes an event attributed to divine intervention. Alternatively, it may be an event attributed to a miracle worker, saint, or religious leader. A miracle is sometimes thought of as a perceptible interruption of the laws of nature. Others suggest that God may work with the laws of nature to perform what people perceive as miracles. Theologians say that, with divine providence, God regularly works through created nature yet is free to work without, above, or against it as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Folio_171r_-_The_Raising_of_Lazarus.jpg/250px-Folio_171r_-_The_Raising_of_Lazarus.jpg
