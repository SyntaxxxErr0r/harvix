The shows were composed of surreality, risqué or innuendo-laden humour, sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines. It also featured Terry Gilliam's animations, often sequenced or merged with live action.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/CompleteFlyingCircusDVD.jpg/225px-CompleteFlyingCircusDVD.jpg
