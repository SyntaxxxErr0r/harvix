3.00	Cyclosis	Cytoplasmic streaming	Cytoplasmic streaming is the directed flow of cytosol (the liquid component of the cytoplasm) and organelles around large fungal and plant cells through the mediation of actin. This movement aids in the delivery of nutrients, metabolites, genetic information, and other materials to all parts of the cell. Cytoplasmic streaming occurs along Actin filaments in the cytoskeleton of the cell. Cyclosis is the circulation or streaming of the cytoplasm within some living cells. In plant cells, chloroplasts may be moved around with the stream, possibly to a position of optimum light absorption for photosynthesis. The rate of motion is usually affected by light exposure, temperature, and pH levels.
