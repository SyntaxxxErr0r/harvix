63.7	Berserker	Berserker	Berserkers (or berserks) were Norse warriors who are reported in the Old Norse literature to have fought in a nearly uncontrollable, trance-like fury, a characteristic which later gave rise to the English word berserk. Berserkers are attested in numerous Old Norse sources. Most historians believe that berserkers worked themselves into a rage before battle, but some think that they might have consumed drugged foods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Bronspl%C3%A5t_pressbleck_%C3%B6land_vendeltid.jpg/220px-Bronspl%C3%A5t_pressbleck_%C3%B6land_vendeltid.jpg
