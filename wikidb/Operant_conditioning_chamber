The operant conditioning chamber was created by B. F. Skinner while he was a graduate student at Harvard University (Masters in 1930 and doctorate in 1931). It is used to study both operant conditioning and classical conditioning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Skinner_box_scheme_01.png/300px-Skinner_box_scheme_01.png
