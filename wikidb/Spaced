66.2	Spaced	Spaced	Spaced is a British television sitcom written by and starring Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson, and directed by Edgar Wright. It is noted for its rapid-fire editing, frequent pop culture references and jokes, eclectic music, and displays of surrealism and non-sequitur humour. Two series of seven episodes each were broadcast in 1999 and 2001 on Channel 4, and were re-aired early in 2011 on both More4 and Dave. Both series can also currently be viewed in the United Kingdom on 4oD and in the United States on Hulu and Netflix.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/10/Spaced.jpg/235px-Spaced.jpg
