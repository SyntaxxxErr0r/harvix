3.00	Near-earth_object	Near-Earth object	A near-Earth object is a Solar System object whose orbit brings it into close proximity with the Earth. All NEOs have a apsis distance less than 1.3 AU. They include a few thousand near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), near-Earth comets, a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft, and meteoroids large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth. It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the planet. NEOs have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of increased awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose to the Earth, and active mitigations are being researched. A study showed that the United States and China are the nations most vulnerable to a meteor strike.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Toutatis.jpg/220px-Toutatis.jpg
