133.6	African-American	African American	African Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans, and formerly as American Negroes) are citizens or residents of the United States who have at least partial ancestry from any of the native populations of Sub-Saharan Africa. Most African Americans are of West and Central African descent and are descendants of enslaved Africans within the boundaries of the present United States. However, some immigrants from African, Caribbean, Central American or South American nations, or their descendants, may be identified or self-identify with the term.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Crispus_Attucks.jpg/220px-Crispus_Attucks.jpg
