109.3	Teotihuacan	Teotihuacan	Teotihuacan – also written Teotihuacán, with a Spanish orthographic accent on the last syllable – is an enormous archaeological site in the Basin of Mexico, just 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Mexico City, containing some of the largest pyramidal structures built in the pre-Columbian Americas. Apart from the pyramidal structures, Teotihuacan is also known for its large residential complexes, the Avenue of the Dead, and numerous colorful, well-preserved murals. Additionally, Teotihuacan produced a thin orange pottery style that spread through Mesoamerica.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/View_from_Pyramide_de_la_luna.jpg/300px-View_from_Pyramide_de_la_luna.jpg
