2.12	London_equations	London equations	The London equations, developed by brothers Fritz and Heinz London in 1935, relate current to electromagnetic fields in and around a superconductor. Arguably the simplest meaningful description of superconducting phenomena, they form the genesis of almost any modern introductory text on the subject. A major triumph of the equations is their ability to explain the Meissner effect, wherein a material exponentially expels all internal magnetic fields as it crosses the superconducting threshold.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/EfektMeisnera.svg/400px-EfektMeisnera.svg.png
