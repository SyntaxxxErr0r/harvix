8.12	My_Scene	My Scene	My Scene is an American series of fashion dolls created by Mattel in 2002. Mattel's Barbie character is one of the dolls in the My Scene line, and the My Scene dolls have slim bodies similar to earlier Barbie dolls, but with larger heads. The New York Times described their features as "exaggerated lips and bulging, makeup-caked eyes." My Scene were designed to appeal to the tween market and compete with the Bratz dolls from MGA Entertainment. The series originally consisted of three female characters, but was expanded to eventually include ten different dolls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fe/My_Scene_dolls_Kennedy_Chelsea_Foto_Fabulous.jpg/200px-My_Scene_dolls_Kennedy_Chelsea_Foto_Fabulous.jpg
