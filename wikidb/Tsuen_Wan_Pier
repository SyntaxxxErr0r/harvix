1.00	Tsuen_Wan_Pier	Tsuen Wan Pier	Tsuen Wan Pier, Tsuen Wan Ferry or Tsuen Wan Ferry Pier (Chinese: ) is a public pier at the south of Tsuen Wan, New Territories, Hong Kong, which is adjacent to MTR Tsuen Wan West Station. It provided ferry service to Central via Tsing Yi, but the service ceased operation in 2000 after Western Harbour Tunnel and MTR Tung Chung Line were commissioned to provide faster route between New Territories West and Hong Kong Island. Now, there is a ferry route travelling between the pier and Park Island, a private housing estate in Ma Wan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/TsuenWanFerryPier.jpg/250px-TsuenWanFerryPier.jpg
