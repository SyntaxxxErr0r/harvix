The book was published by Ollendorff in Paris in July 1891, and was dedicated to Robert Louis Stevenson, a powerful influence on Schwob's work. With its evocative language and its combination of sensual and macabre elements it attracted the admiration of many reviewers, including Anatole France, and, initially, a small circle of readers.
