He also presents arguments to refute certain criticisms made on his previous book, The Selfish Gene. (Both books espouse the gene-centric view of evolution.) An unabridged audiobook edition was released by Audible Inc in 2011, narrated by Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Blind_Watchmaker.jpg/200px-Blind_Watchmaker.jpg
