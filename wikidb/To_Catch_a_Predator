57.8	To_Catch_a_Predator	To Catch a Predator	To Catch a Predator is an American reality television series that featured hidden camera investigations by the television newsmagazine program Dateline NBC. It was devoted to impersonating underage youth (generally ages 12â€“15) and detaining adults who contact them over the Internet for sexual liaisons. People are lured to meet with a decoy under the pretense of sexual contact and then confronted. Show host Chris Hansen emphasized that these subjects should be labeled as potential sexual predators, and not pedophiles. "Pedophiles have a very specific definition, people who are interested in prepubescent sex," he stated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/ToCatchAPredatorNew.jpg/250px-ToCatchAPredatorNew.jpg
