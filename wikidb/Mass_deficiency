1.00	Mass_deficiency	Binding energy	Binding energy is the mechanical energy required to disassemble a whole into separate parts. A bound system typically has a lower potential energy than its constituent parts; this is what keeps the system togetherâ€”often this means that energy is released upon the creation of a bound state. The usual convention is that this corresponds to a positive binding energy.
