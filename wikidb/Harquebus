3.00	Harquebus	Arquebus	The arquebus ( -ə-bus or -kwə-bus) (sometimes spelled harquebus, harkbus or hackbut; from Dutch haakbus, meaning "hook gun"), or "hook tube", is an early muzzle-loaded firearm used in the 15th to 17th centuries. The word was originally modeled on the German hakenbüchse; this produced haquebute. It then copied the Italian word archibugio, which gave arquebuse (French), arcabuz (Spanish), arcabus (Portuguese), and arquebus (English). In distinction from its predecessor the hand cannon, it has a matchlock. Like its successor the musket, it is a smoothbore firearm, but lighter and easier to carry .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/EdoJapaneseArquebuse.jpg/300px-EdoJapaneseArquebuse.jpg
