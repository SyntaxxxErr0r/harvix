4.10	Stunts,_Blunts_and_Hip_Hop	Stunts, Blunts and Hip Hop	Stunts, Blunts and Hip Hop is the debut album from hip hop producer-emcee Diamond D, released in 1992. The album features some of the earliest appearances from Diamond's later D.I.T.C. partners Big L and Fat Joe, as well as his crew the Psychotic Neurotics. Although Diamond D handles the majority of the album's production, other popular beat makers such as Large Professor, Q-Tip, Jazzy Jay, Showbiz, and DJ Mark the 45 King co-produce on several tracks. The album features the singles "Best-Kept Secret" and "Sally Got a One-Track Mind." The album was not released on vinyl, however, there were promotional copies pressed up with full artwork which were very highly sought-after. The vinyl edition was eventually made available as a reissue years later. The original promo has a sticker on it; the reissue had this sticker scanned into the artwork.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/Stuntsbluntsandhiphop.jpg
