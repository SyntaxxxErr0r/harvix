1.00	Y_Chromosome_Adam	Y-chromosomal Adam	In human genetics, Y-chromosomal Adam is the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) from whom all living people are descended patrilineally (tracing back only along the paternal lines of their family tree). Many studies report that Y-chromosomal Adam lived as early as around 142,000 years ago and possibly as recently as 60,000 years ago. All living humans are also descended matrilineally from Mitochondrial Eve who is thought to have lived earlier about 190,000 - 200,000 years ago. Y-chromosomal Adam and Mitochondrial Eve need not have lived at the same time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Albero_Y-DNA.jpg/300px-Albero_Y-DNA.jpg
