108.1	Area	Area	Area is a quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional surface or shape in the plane. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Area.svg/220px-Area.svg.png
