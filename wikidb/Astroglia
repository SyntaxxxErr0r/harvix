They perform many functions, including biochemical support of endothelial cells that form the bloodâ€“brain barrier, provision of nutrients to the nervous tissue, maintenance of extracellular ion balance, and a role in the repair and scarring process of the brain and spinal cord following traumatic injuries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Gfapastr5.jpg/240px-Gfapastr5.jpg
