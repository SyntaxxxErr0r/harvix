2.10	Coat_of_arms_of_South_Ossetia	Coat of arms of South Ossetia	The national emblem used by the government of the Republic of South Ossetia, adopted in 1998, is based on the emblem of North Ossetia-Alania, designed by the Georgian scientist Prince Vakhushti Bagrationi in 1735. It adds around that seal a border containing the Russian text for "Republic of South Ossetia", "Республика Южная Осетия" above the seal, and the Cyrillic Ossetic "Республикæ Хуссар Ирыстон" below the seal. The colours of the flag of South Ossetia, white, red, and yellow are used in smaller circles on either side and are similar to the circle found on the state emblem.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Coat_of_arms_of_South_Ossetia.svg/125px-Coat_of_arms_of_South_Ossetia.svg.png
