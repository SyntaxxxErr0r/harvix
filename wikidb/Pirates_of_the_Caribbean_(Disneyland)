2.21	Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(Disneyland)	Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)	The ride begins amid glimmering fireflies during an evening in a Louisiana bayou. Riders board their boats at Laffite's Landing and are at once afloat in the heart of bayou country, after the safety spiel given by Blackbeard. On one side is a working restaurant, The Blue Bayou, made to look like the backyard dinner party of a southern plantation. It takes three days to empty and refill the "bayou" for renovations. There are 630,000 gallons of water, 53 audio-animatronic animals and birds, and 75 audio-animatronic pirates and villagers in the attraction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Entrance.JPG/250px-Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Entrance.JPG
