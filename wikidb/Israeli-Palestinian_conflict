62.1	Israeli-Palestinian_conflict	Israeli–Palestinian conflict	The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is the ongoing struggle between Israelis and Palestinians that began in the early 20th century. The conflict is wide-ranging, and the term is also used in reference to the earlier phases of the same conflict, between the Zionist yishuv and the Arab population living in Palestine under Ottoman and then British rule. It forms part of the wider Arab–Israeli conflict. The remaining key issues are: mutual recognition, borders, security, water rights, control of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements, Palestinian freedom of movement and legalities concerning refugees. The violence resulting from the conflict has prompted international actions, as well as other security and human rights concerns, both within and between both sides, and internationally. In addition, the violence has curbed expansion of tourism in the region, which is full of historic and religious sites that are of interest to many people around the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/West_Bank_%26_Gaza_Map_2007_%28Settlements%29.png/250px-West_Bank_%26_Gaza_Map_2007_%28Settlements%29.png
