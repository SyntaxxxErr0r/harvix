73.1	Procrustes	Procrustes	In Greek mythology Procrustes (Προκρούστης) or "the stretcher ", also known as Prokoptas or Damastes (Δαμαστής) "subduer", was a rogue smith and bandit from Attica who physically attacked people by stretching them or cutting off their legs, so as to force them to fit the size of an iron bed. In general, when something is Procrustean, different lengths or sizes or properties are fitted to an arbitrary standard.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Theseus_Prokroustes_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_2325.jpg/170px-Theseus_Prokroustes_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_2325.jpg
