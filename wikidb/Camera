145.7	Camera	Camera	A camera is a device that records and stores images. These images may be still photographs or moving images such as videos or movies. The term camera comes from the word camera obscura (Latin for "dark chamber"), an early mechanism for projecting images. The modern camera evolved from the camera obscura.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Cameras.jpg/300px-Cameras.jpg
