The series revolves around five girls. Massie Block, Alicia Rivera, Dylan Marvil, and Kristen Gregory collectively make up The Pretty Committee, an 'A-Lister' clique at the fictional, all girls middle school, Octavian Country Day, or as Massie likes to call it, OCD. While the fith Claire Lyons is a misfit girl from Orlando, Florida. She shops at stores like Wal-Mart and Target and has no clue what life in Westchester is like and what is expected of her there. Massie is the head of the clique, dressed in Juicy Couture, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, Jimmy Choo etc. while Claire, a newcomer to the area, is initially considered an outcast due to her financial and fashion status. She is also not welcomed at first because of her attitude, which is that she assumes since she is living in Massie's guest house she should be Massie's friend and a member of the Pretty Committee. As the series progresses, she slowly develops a friendship with Massie, realizing that she must earn her friendship, and eventually becomes a member of the group. She soon finds out though, life in The Pretty Committee isn't all unicorns and gold...	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fc/The_Clique.jpg/220px-The_Clique.jpg
