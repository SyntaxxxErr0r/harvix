58.0	Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)	Jonathan Edwards (theologian)	Jonathan Edwards (October 5, 1703 â€“ March 22, 1758) was a Christian preacher and theologian. Edwards "is widely acknowledged to be America's most important and original philosophical theologian," and one of America's greatest theologians. Edwards's theological work is very broad in scope, but he is often associated with his defense of Reformed theology (Calvinism), the metaphysics of theological determinism, and the Puritan heritage. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset..	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Jonathan_Edwards.jpg/220px-Jonathan_Edwards.jpg
