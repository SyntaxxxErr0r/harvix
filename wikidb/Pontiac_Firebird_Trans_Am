The Firebird was introduced the same year as the automaker's platform-sharing model, the Chevrolet Camaro. This coincided with the release of the 1967 Mercury Cougar, which shared its platform with another pony car, the Ford Mustang.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cb/Trans_Am_Family.jpg/250px-Trans_Am_Family.jpg
