1.00	Roll_On,_Columbia	Roll On, Columbia, Roll On	"Roll On, Columbia, Roll On" is an American folk song written in 1941 by American folk singer Woody Guthrie, who popularized the song through his own recording of it. One of the most popular songs in the history of the United States, it glamorized the harnessing of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest. The 11 hydroelectric dams built on the American stretch of the Columbia helped farms and industry, but their construction also permanently altered the character of the river. The song became famous as an anthem about American public works projects arising out of the New Deal in the Great Depression.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Woody_Guthrie_NYWTS.jpg/200px-Woody_Guthrie_NYWTS.jpg
