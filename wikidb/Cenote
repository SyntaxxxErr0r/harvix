93.1	Cenote	Cenote	A cenote is a deep natural pit, or sinkhole, characteristic of Mexico and Central America, resulting from the collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater underneath. Especially associated with the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and some nearby Caribbean islands, cenotes were sometimes used by the ancient Maya for sacrificial offerings. The term derives from a word used by the low-land Yucatec Maya, to mean any location with accessible groundwater.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Mexico_Cenotes.jpg/345px-Mexico_Cenotes.jpg
