3.20	Jazz_Fenton	List of Danny Phantom characters	Vlad Masters is the arch-nemesis and worst enemy of Danny. A rich, debonair billionaire, Vlad is a powerful half-ghost whose twenty years of experience constantly one-up Danny's ghostly abilities. As the main antagonist in the series, he vows to destroy Jack for "stealing" Maddie, whom he loves, and for giving him his ghost powers which in the process put him into a hospital room for seven years. He also has goals to obtain Danny as his son and, later, torment him after one too many rejections.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/Technus.jpg/150px-Technus.jpg
