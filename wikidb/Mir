73.7	Mir	Mir	Mir was a space station operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001, at first by the Soviet Union and then by Russia. Assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996, Mir was the first modular space station and had a greater mass than that of any previous spacecraft, holding the record for the largest artificial satellite orbiting the Earth until its deorbit on 21 March 2001 (a record now surpassed by the International Space Station). Mir served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems in order to develop technologies required for the permanent occupation of space.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Mir_Space_Station_viewed_from_Endeavour_during_STS-89.jpg/240px-Mir_Space_Station_viewed_from_Endeavour_during_STS-89.jpg
