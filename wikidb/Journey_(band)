91.1	Journey_(band)	Journey (band)	Journey is an American rock band formed in 1973 in San Francisco by former members of Santana. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987, after which it temporarily disbanded. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including 1981's "Don't Stop Believin'", the top-selling catalog track in iTunes history. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached #1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, "Open Arms". Its 1983 follow-up, Frontiers, was almost as successful in the United States, reaching #2 and spawning several successful singles; it broadened the band's appeal in the United Kingdom, where it reached #6 on the UK Albums Chart. Journey enjoyed a successful reunion in the mid 1990s, and later regrouped with a series of lead singers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Journey_band.JPG/250px-Journey_band.JPG
