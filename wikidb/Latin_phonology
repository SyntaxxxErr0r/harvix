2.03	Latin_phonology	Latin spelling and pronunciation	Latin spelling or orthography refers to the spelling of Latin words written in the scripts of all historical phases of Latin, from Old Latin to the present. All scripts use the same alphabet, but conventional spellings may vary from phase to phase. The Roman alphabet, or Latin alphabet, was adapted from the Old Italic alphabet to represent the phonemes of the Latin language. The Old Italic alphabet had in turn been borrowed from the Greek alphabet, itself adapted from the Phoenician alphabet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Appiuscaecusstele01.jpg/300px-Appiuscaecusstele01.jpg
