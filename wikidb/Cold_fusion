253.6	Cold_fusion	Cold fusion	Cold fusion is a proposed type of nuclear reaction that would occur at relatively low temperatures compared with hot fusion. As a new type of nuclear reaction, it was proposed to explain reports by experimenters of anomalously high energy generation under certain specific laboratory conditions. It has been rejected by the mainstream scientific community because the original experimental results could not be replicated consistently and reliably, and because there is no generally accepted theoretical model of cold fusion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Cold-fusion-calorimeter-nhe-diagram.png/250px-Cold-fusion-calorimeter-nhe-diagram.png
