81.1	Bell_pepper	Bell pepper	Bell pepper, also known as sweet pepper or a pepper (in the UK) and capsicum (in Australia and New Zealand), is a cultivar group of the species Capsicum annuum . Cultivars of the plant produce fruits in different colors, including red, yellow, orange and green. Bell peppers are sometimes grouped with less pungent pepper varieties as "sweet peppers". Peppers are native to Mexico, Central America and northern South America. Pepper seeds were later carried to Spain in 1493 and from there spread to other European, African and Asian countries. Today, China is the world's largest pepper producer, followed by Mexico.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Poivrons_Luc_Viatour.jpg/220px-Poivrons_Luc_Viatour.jpg
