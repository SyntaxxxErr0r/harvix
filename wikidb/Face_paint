2.00	Face_paint	Body painting	Body painting, or sometimes bodypainting, is a form of body art. Unlike tattoo and other forms of body art, body painting is temporary, painted onto the human skin, and lasts for only several hours, or at most (in the case of Mehndi or "henna tattoo") a couple of weeks. Body painting that is limited to the face is known as face painting. Body painting is also referred to as (a form of) temporary tattoo; large scale or full-body painting is more commonly referred to as body painting, while smaller or more detailed work is generally referred to as temporary tattoos.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Bodypainting_Saints.jpg/200px-Bodypainting_Saints.jpg
