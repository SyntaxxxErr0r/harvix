1.10	Snowmaker	Snowmaking	Snowmaking is the production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a "snow gun" or "snow cannon", on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used at ski resorts to supplement natural snow. This allows ski resorts to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons. Indoor ski slopes often use snowmaking. They are generally able to do so year-round as they have a climate-controlled environment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/SuperCrystal%40Camelback.jpg/300px-SuperCrystal%40Camelback.jpg
