13.13	Natural_ventilation	Natural ventilation	Natural ventilation is the process of supplying and removing air through an indoor space without using mechanical systems. It refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of pressure or temperatures differences. There are two types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings: wind driven ventilation and buoyancy-driven ventilation. While wind is the main mechanism of wind driven ventilation, buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/EarthshipVentilation_new.png/250px-EarthshipVentilation_new.png
