204.2	Haggis	Haggis	Haggis is a kind of savoury pudding containing sheep's pluck (heart, liver and lungs â€” see offal); minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and traditionally encased in the animal's stomach and simmered for approximately three hours. Most modern commercial haggis is prepared in a sausage casing rather than an actual stomach.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Scotland_Haggis.jpg/300px-Scotland_Haggis.jpg
