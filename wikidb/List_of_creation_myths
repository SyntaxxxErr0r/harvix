Creation myths are the most common form of myth, usually developing first in oral traditions, and are found throughout human culture. A creation myth is usually regarded by those who subscribe to it as conveying profound truths, although not necessarily in a historical or literal sense. They are commonly, although not always, considered cosmogonical mythsâ€”that is they describe the ordering of the cosmos from a state of chaos or amorphousness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/God2-Sistine_Chapel.png/300px-God2-Sistine_Chapel.png
