54.9	Oxford_Street	Oxford Street	Oxford Street is a major thoroughfare in the City of Westminster in the West End of London, United Kingdom. It is Europe's busiest shopping street, and as of 2011 had approximately 300 shops. The street was formerly part of the London-Oxford road which began at Newgate, City of London, and was known as the Oxford Road. Today it forms part of the A40 trunk road, although like many roads in central London which are no longer through traffic routes it is not signposted with the road number.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Heavy_Bus_Traffic_on_Oxford_Street.jpg/280px-Heavy_Bus_Traffic_on_Oxford_Street.jpg
