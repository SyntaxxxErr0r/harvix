6.00	Lever_escapement	Lever escapement	The lever escapement is a key component of the typical movement found in most mechanical wristwatches, pocket watches and many small mechanical non-pendulum clocks. The invention of the lever escapement is attributed to Thomas Mudge, and its modern form was developed by subsequent workers including Breguet and Massey. It is a detached escapement, which means that the time-keeping element runs entirely free of interference from the escapement during most of the operating cycle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Anker_01.jpg/220px-Anker_01.jpg
