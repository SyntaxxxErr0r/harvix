85.6	Ali_Khamenei	Ali Khamenei	Holding absolute power in his country, he has been described as one of only three people having "important influence" on the Islamic Republic of Iran (the other two being the founder of the republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and the president of Iran for much of the 1990s, Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani). So far, the biggest challenge to his leadership has been the mass protests following the June 2009 presidential elections. Khamenei, however, continued to strongly support Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's policies and re-election. Khamenei was the victim of an attack aimed to assassinate him in June 1981 that paralyzed his right arm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran_and_Commanders_3.jpg/220px-Supreme_Leader_of_Iran_and_Commanders_3.jpg
