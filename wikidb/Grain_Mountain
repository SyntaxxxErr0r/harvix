1.01	Grain_Mountain	Buffer stock scheme	A buffer stock scheme (commonly implemented as intervention storage, the "ever-normal granary") is an attempt to use commodity storage for the purposes of stabilising prices in an entire economy or, more commonly, an individual (commodity) market. Specifically, commodities are bought when there is a surplus in the economy, stored, and are then sold from these stores when there are economic shortages in the economy. Their usefulness is debated by economists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Buffer_stock_scheme_%28with_ceiling_%26_floor%29.svg/350px-Buffer_stock_scheme_%28with_ceiling_%26_floor%29.svg.png
