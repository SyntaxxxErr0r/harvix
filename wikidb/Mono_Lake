57.1	Mono_Lake	Mono Lake	Mono Lake is a large, shallow saline lake in Mono County, California, formed at least 760,000 years ago as a terminal lake in a basin that has no outlet to the ocean. Because it lacks an outlet, dissolved salts make the lake very alkaline and saline.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Wfm_mono_lake_landsat.jpg/240px-Wfm_mono_lake_landsat.jpg
