52.7	Thomas_Bowdler	Thomas Bowdler	Thomas Bowdler (11 July 1754 â€“ 24 February 1825) was an English physician and philanthropist, best known for publishing The Family Shakspeare, an expurgated edition of William Shakespeare's work, edited by his sister Henrietta Maria Bowdler, intended to be more appropriate for 19th century women and children than the original. Although early editions of the work were published with the spelling "Shakspeare", after Bowdler's death, later editions (from 1847) adopted the spelling "Shakespeare", reflecting changes in the standard spelling of Shakespeare's name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Bowdler-title-page.png/220px-Bowdler-title-page.png
