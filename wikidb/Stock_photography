It is used to fulfill the needs of creative assignments instead of hiring a photographer. Today, stock images can be presented in searchable online databases. They can be purchased and delivered online. Often, they are produced in studios using a wide variety of models posing as professionals, stereotypes, expressing stereotypical emotions and gesticulations or involving pets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/1911_Solvay_conference.jpg/240px-1911_Solvay_conference.jpg
