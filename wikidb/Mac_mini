56.4	Mac_mini	Mac Mini	The Mac Mini (marketed as Mac mini) is a small form factor desktop computer manufactured by Apple Inc. Like earlier mini-ITX PC designs, it is quite small for a desktop computer: 7.7 inches (19.7 cm) square and 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) tall. It weighs 2.7 pounds (1.22 kg). Prior to the mid-2011 revision, all models, except the mid-2010 server model, came with an internal optical disc drive. Models prior to 2010 used an external power supply and were narrower but taller at 2 × 6.5 × 6.5 inches (50.8 × 165.1 × 165.1 mm). The Mac Mini is one of three desktop computers in the current Macintosh lineup, the other two being the iMac and Mac Pro, although it generally uses components usually featured in laptops, hence its small size.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Mac_mini.png/250px-Mac_mini.png
