59.3	Classical_Greece	Classical Greece	In 510 BC, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow their king, the tyrant Hippias, son of Peisistratos. Cleomenes I, king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy headed by Isagoras. But his rival Cleisthenes, with the support of the middle class and aided by democrats, managed to take over. Cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 BC, but could not stop Cleisthenes, now supported by the Athenians. Through his reforms, the people endowed their city with isonomic institutions — i.e., ones in which all have the same rights — and established ostracism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Parthenon_from_south.jpg/270px-Parthenon_from_south.jpg
