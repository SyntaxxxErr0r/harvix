7.41	69th_Academy_Awards	69th Academy Awards	The 69th Academy Awards were dominated by movies produced by independent studios, financed outside of mainstream Hollywood, leading to 1996 being dubbed "The Year of the Independents". All but one of the nominees for Best Picture were low-budget independent movies (the next ceremony dominated by indie fims would be in 2006. 2008 was also dominated by independents).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6d/69th_Academy_Awards.jpg/220px-69th_Academy_Awards.jpg
