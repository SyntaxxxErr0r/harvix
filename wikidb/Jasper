51.6	Jasper	Jasper	Jasper, a form of chalcedony, is an opaque, impure variety of silica, usually red, yellow, brown or green in color; and rarely blue. This mineral breaks with a smooth surface, and is used for ornamentation or as a gemstone. It can be highly polished and is used for vases, seals, and at one time for snuff boxes. When the colors are in stripes or bands, it is called striped or banded jasper. Jaspilite is a banded iron formation rock that often has distinctive bands of jasper. Jasper is basically chert which owes its red color to iron(III) inclusions. The specific gravity of jasper is typically 2.5 to 2.9. The jasper is, along with Heliotrope (bloodstone), one of the traditional birthstones for March. It is also a stone in the Jewish High Priest's breastplate, described in Exodus 28.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Jasper.pebble.600pix.bkg.jpg/180px-Jasper.pebble.600pix.bkg.jpg
