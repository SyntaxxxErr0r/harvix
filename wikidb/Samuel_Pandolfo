4.00	Samuel_Pandolfo	Samuel Pandolfo	In 1917, Samuel Pandolfo raised $9.5 million through stock sales and built an automobile plant in St. Cloud, Minnesota. During the next two years, the plant turned out 737 automobiles and fulfilled numerous U.S. government war contracts. Yet by 1919, Pandolfo was out of business. Found guilty of mail fraud, Pandolfo received a three-year prison sentence in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, and his company was ultimately closed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Samuel_Pandolfo.jpg
