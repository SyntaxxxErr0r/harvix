84.7	Neuropsychology	Neuropsychology	Neuropsychology studies the structure and function of the brain as they relate to specific psychological processes and behaviors. The term neuropsychology has been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals. It has also been applied to efforts to record electrical activity from individual cells (or groups of cells) in higher primates (including some studies of human patients). It is scientific in its approach, making use of neuroscience, and shares an information processing view of the mind with cognitive psychology and cognitive science.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Gray739.png/130px-Gray739.png
