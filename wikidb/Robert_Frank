138.7	Robert_Frank	Robert Frank	Robert Frank (born November 9, 1924), born in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, is an important figure in American photography and film. His most notable work, the 1958 photobook titled The Americans, was influential, and earned Frank comparisons to a modern-day de Tocqueville for his fresh and skeptical outsider's view of American society. Frank later expanded into film and video and experimented with compositing and manipulating photographs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/The_Americans.jpg/250px-The_Americans.jpg
