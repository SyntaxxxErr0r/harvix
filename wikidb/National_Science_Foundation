With an annual budget of about US$6.87 billion (fiscal year 2010), the NSF funds approximately 20% of all federally supported basic research conducted by the United States' colleges and universities. In some fields, such as mathematics, computer science, economics and the social sciences, the NSF is the major source of federal backing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Nsf1.jpg/140px-Nsf1.jpg
