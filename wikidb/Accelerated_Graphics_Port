57.1	Accelerated_Graphics_Port	Accelerated Graphics Port	The Accelerated Graphics Port (often shortened to AGP) is a high-speed point-to-point channel for attaching a video card to a computer's motherboard, primarily to assist in the acceleration of 3D computer graphics. Since 2004 AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of PCI Express (PCIe). By mid-2009 PCIe cards dominated the market; AGP cards and motherboards were still produced, but OEM driver support was minimal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/AGPLogo.svg/193px-AGPLogo.svg.png
