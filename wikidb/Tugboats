2.00	Tugboats	Tugboat	A tugboat is a boat that maneuvers vessels by pushing or towing them. Tugs move vessels that either should not move themselves, such as ships in a crowded harbor or a narrow canal, or those that cannot move by themselves, such as barges, disabled ships, or oil platforms. Tugboats are powerful for their size and strongly built, and some are ocean-going. Some tugboats serve as icebreakers or salvage boats. Early tugboats had steam engines, but today have diesel engines. Many tugboats have firefighting monitors, allowing them to assist in firefighting, especially in harbors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/To_Move_Those_that_Cannot_Move_by_Themselves..jpg/220px-To_Move_Those_that_Cannot_Move_by_Themselves..jpg
