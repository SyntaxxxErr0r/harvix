55.7	Tortoise	Tortoise	Tortoises ( , Testudinidae) are a family of land-dwelling reptiles of the order of turtles (Testudines). Like their marine cousins, the sea turtles, tortoises are shielded from predators by a shell. The top part of the shell is the carapace, the underside is the plastron, and the two are connected by the bridge. The tortoise has both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton. Tortoises can vary in size from a few centimeters to two meters. Tortoises are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally reclusive animals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/A._gigantea_Aldabra_Giant_Tortoise.jpg/250px-A._gigantea_Aldabra_Giant_Tortoise.jpg
