7.32	State_(administrative_division)	Federated state	A federated state (often referred to simply as a state or as a province) is a territorial and constitutional community forming part of a federal union. Such states differ from sovereign states, in that they have transferred a portion of their sovereign powers to a federal government. A federated state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and is a form of regional government.
