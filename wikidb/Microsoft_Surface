71.5	Microsoft_Surface	Microsoft Surface	Microsoft Surface (“Surface”) is a commercial computing platform that enables people to use touch and real world objects to share digital content at the same time. The Surface platform consists of software and hardware products that combine vision based multitouch PC hardware, 360-degree multiuser application design, and Windows software to create a natural user interface (NUI) for users. Microsoft Surface 1.0, the first version of Surface, was announced on May 29, 2007 at the D5 Conference. It shipped to customers in 2008 as an end-to-end solution with Microsoft producing and selling the combined hardware/software platform. Microsoft and Samsung partnered to announce the current version of Surface, the Samsung SUR40 for Microsoft Surface (“SUR40”), at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2011. Samsung began shipping the new SUR40 hardware with the Microsoft Surface 2.0 software platform to customers in early 2012. Microsoft also provides the free Microsoft Surface 2.0 Software Development Kit (SDK) for developers to create NUI touch applications for Surface and Windows 7 touch PCs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Microsoft_Surface.png/200px-Microsoft_Surface.png
