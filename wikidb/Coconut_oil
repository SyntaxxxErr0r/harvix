64.1	Coconut_oil	Coconut oil	Coconut oil is an edible oil extracted from the kernel or meat of matured coconuts harvested from the coconut palm . Throughout the tropical world, it has provided the primary source of fat in the diets of millions of people for generations. It has various applications in food, medicine, and industry. Coconut oil is very heat-stable, which makes it suited to methods of cooking at high temperatures like frying. Because of its stability, it is slow to oxidize and, thus, resistant to rancidity, lasting up to two years due to high saturated fat content. As with dairy and meat products, the United States Food and Drug Administration,, World Health Organization, International College of Nutrition, United States Department of Health and Human Services, American Dietetic Association, American Heart Association, British National Health Service, and Dietitians of Canada recommend limiting the consumption of significant amounts of coconut oil due to its high levels of saturated fat.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Coconut_oil_making_Seychelles.jpg/240px-Coconut_oil_making_Seychelles.jpg
