6.30	Conjoined_twin	Conjoined twins	Conjoined twins (aka Siamese twins) are identical twins whose bodies are joined in utero. A rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 50,000 births to 1 in 100,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southwest Asia and Africa. Approximately half are stillborn, and a smaller fraction of pairs born alive have abnormalities incompatible with life. The overall survival rate for conjoined twins is approximately 25%. The condition is more frequently found among females, with a ratio of 3:1.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Chang-eng-bunker-PD.gif/230px-Chang-eng-bunker-PD.gif
