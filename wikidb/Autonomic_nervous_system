102.2	Autonomic_nervous_system	Autonomic nervous system	The autonomic nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that acts as a control system functioning largely below the level of consciousness, and controls visceral functions. The ANS affects heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, salivation, perspiration, diameter of the pupils, micturition (urination), and sexual arousal. Whereas most of its actions are involuntary, some, such as breathing, work in tandem with the conscious mind.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Gray839.png/250px-Gray839.png
