3.00	Zapoteco	Zapotec languages	The Zapotec language(s) are a group of closely related indigenous Mesoamerican languages spoken by the Zapotec people from the southwestern-central highlands of Mexico. Present-day native speakers are estimated to number over half a million, with the majority inhabiting the state of Oaxaca. Zapotec-speaking communities are also found in the neighboring states of Puebla and Guerrero. Emigration has also brought a number of native Zapotec-speakers to the United States, particularly in California. In most Zapotec-speaking communities, Spanish is also spoken.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Zapotecan_Languages.png/300px-Zapotecan_Languages.png
