2.00	Three_Finger_Brown	Mordecai Brown	Mordecai Peter Centennial Brown (October 19, 1876 â€“ February 14, 1948), nicknamed "Three Finger" or "Miner", was an American Major League Baseball pitcher at the turn of the 20th century. Due to a farm-machinery accident in his youth, Brown lost parts of two fingers on his right hand and eventually acquired his nickname as a result. Overcoming this handicap and turning it to his advantage, he became one of the elite pitchers of his era. He was known primarily for his exceptional curveball, which broke radically before reaching the plate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/Mordecai_Brown_Baseball.jpg/200px-Mordecai_Brown_Baseball.jpg
