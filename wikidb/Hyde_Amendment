87.6	Hyde_Amendment	Hyde Amendment	In U.S. politics, the Hyde Amendment is a legislative provision barring the use of certain federal funds to pay for abortions. It is not a permanent law, rather it is a "rider" that, in various forms, has been routinely attached to annual appropriations bills since 1976. The Hyde Amendment applies only to funds allocated by the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Health and Human Services. It primarily affects Medicaid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/State_abortion_funding.svg/220px-State_abortion_funding.svg.png
