231.1	Sender_Policy_Framework	Sender Policy Framework	The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol permits any computer to send email claiming to be from any source address. This is exploited by spammers who often use forged email addresses, making it more difficult to trace a message back to its sender, and easy for spammers to hide their identity in order to avoid responsibility. Many believe that the ability for anyone to forge sender addresses is a security flaw in modern SMTP.
