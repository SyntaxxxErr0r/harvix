The game was developed by id Software and featured music composed by Sonic Mayhem and Front Line Assembly. Quake III Arena is the third in the series and differs from previous games by excluding a traditional single-player element and focusing on multi-player action. The single-player is instead played against computer controlled bots in a similar style to Unreal Tournament.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/Quake3Title.jpg/250px-Quake3Title.jpg
