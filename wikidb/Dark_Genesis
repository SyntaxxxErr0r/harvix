1.00	Dark_Genesis	Dark Genesis	Dark Genesis is a five-disc box set by American heavy metal band Iced Earth, released on November 27, 2001. It contains remastered versions of their first three studio albums; Iced Earth, Night of the Stormrider and Burnt Offerings), their rare demo Enter the Realm, and a newly recorded tribute CD, Tribute to the Gods, which contains covers of many songs that have influenced Iced Earth. The Tribute to the Gods CD was the last Iced Earth release to feature lead guitarist Larry Tarnowski, and the last to feature Matt Barlow until his 2007 return. As well, that same disc marked bassist James MacDonough's first Iced Earth disc since 1999, as he had been absent during the recording of Horror Show.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Dark_Genesis_cover.jpg/220px-Dark_Genesis_cover.jpg
