77.4	Siege_of_Leningrad	Siege of Leningrad	The Siege of Leningrad, also known as the Leningrad Blockade was a prolonged military operation resulting from the failure of the German Army Group North to capture Leningrad—now known as Saint Petersburg—in the Eastern Front theatre of World War II. The siege started on 8 September 1941, when the last land connection to the city was severed. Although the Soviets managed to open a narrow land corridor to the city on 18 January 1943, lifting of the siege took place on 27 January 1944, 872 days after it began. It was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history and overwhelmingly the most costly in terms of casualties.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Blokada_Leningrad_diorama.jpg/300px-Blokada_Leningrad_diorama.jpg
