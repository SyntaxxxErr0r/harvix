6.02	Firuz_Shah_Tughlaq	Firuz Shah Tughlaq	Firoz Shah Tughlaq (Persian: ‎, Hindi: ; 1309 – September 20, 1388) was a Turkic Muslim ruler of the Tughlaq Dynasty, who reigned over the Sultanate of Delhi from 1351 to 1388. He was the son of a Hindu princess of Dipalpur. His father's name was Razzab (the younger brother of Ghazi Malik). Firuz Shah Tughlaq succeeded his cousin Muhammad bin Tughluq following the later's death from a fatal illness, but due to widespread unrest Firuz's realm was much smaller than Muhammed's. Firuz Shah Tughlaq was forced by rebellions to concede virtual independence to Bengal and other provinces.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/West_Gate_of_Feruzabad_since_destroyed.jpg/240px-West_Gate_of_Feruzabad_since_destroyed.jpg
