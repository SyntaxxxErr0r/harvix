126.8	Swahili_language	Swahili language	Swahili or Kiswahili (known in Swahili itself as Kiswahili) is a Bantu language spoken by various ethnic groups that inhabit several large stretches of the Mozambique Channel coastline from northern Kenya to northern Mozambique, including the Comoro Islands. It is also spoken by ethnic minority groups in Somalia. Although only five million people speak Swahili as their mother tongue, it is used as a lingua franca in much of East Africa, meaning the total number of speakers exceeds 60 million. Swahili serves as a national, or official language, of five nations: Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, the Comoros and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Maeneo_penye_wasemaji_wa_Kiswahili.png/300px-Maeneo_penye_wasemaji_wa_Kiswahili.png
