2.02	Holy_Tunic	Seamless robe of Jesus	According to the Gospel of John, the soldiers who crucified Jesus did not divide his tunic after crucifying him, but cast lots to determine who would keep it because it was woven in one piece, without seam. A distinction is made in the New Testament Greek between the himatia (literally “over-garments”) and the seamless robe, which is chiton, (literally “tunic” or “coat”).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/KitaPilgerstab.jpg/220px-KitaPilgerstab.jpg
