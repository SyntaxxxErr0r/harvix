20.13	Continuity_equation	Continuity equation	As stated above, the idea behind the continuity equation is the flow of some property, such as mass, energy, electric charge, momentum, and even probability, through surfaces from one region of space to another. The surfaces, in general, may either be open or closed, real or imaginary, and have an arbitrary shape, but are fixed for the calculation (i.e. not time-varying, which is appropriate since this complicates the maths for no advantage). Let this property be represented by just one scalar variable, q, and let the volume density of this property (the amount of q per unit volume V) be φ, and the all surfaces be denoted by S. Mathematically, φ is a ratio of two infinitesimal quantities:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Continuity_eqn_open_surface.svg/400px-Continuity_eqn_open_surface.svg.png
