Originally published in sets of ten between 1899 and 1904 and as a complete volume in 1904, it consists of 100 prints of various organisms, many of which were first described by Haeckel himself. Over the course of his career, over 1000 engravings were produced based on Haeckel's sketches and watercolors; many of the best of these were chosen for Kunstformen der Natur, translated from sketch to print by lithographer Adolf Giltsch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Haeckel_Discomedusae_8.jpg/220px-Haeckel_Discomedusae_8.jpg
