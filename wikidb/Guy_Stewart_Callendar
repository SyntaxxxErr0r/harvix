His main contribution to knowledge was propounding the theory that linked rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere to global temperature. This eventually became known as the Callendar effect. Callendar thought this warming would be beneficial, delaying a "return of the deadly glaciers."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/GSCallendar1934.jpg/250px-GSCallendar1934.jpg
