3.20	SLC4A3	SLC4A3	Anion exchange protein 3 is a membrane transport protein that in humans is encoded by the SLC4A3 gene. AE3 is functionally similar to the Band 3 Cl-/HCO3- exchange protein but it is expressed primarily in brain neurons and in the heart. Like AE2 its activity is sensitive to pH. AE3 mutations have been linked to seizures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/PDB_1bh7_EBI.jpg/250px-PDB_1bh7_EBI.jpg
