10.61	Free_Syrian_Army	Free Syrian Army	The Free Syrian Army is the main opposition army group in Syria. It is composed of defected Syrian Armed Forces personnel, who have been active during the Syrian Uprising. The formation of the opposition army group was announced on 29 July 2011 in a web-video released by a group of uniformed defectors from the Syrian military, who called upon members of the army to also defect and join them. The leader of the men, who identified himself as Colonel Riad al-Asaad, announced that the FSA would work with demonstrators to bring down the system and declared that all security forces attacking civilians are justified targets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Free_syrian_army_coat_of_arms.svg/225px-Free_syrian_army_coat_of_arms.svg.png
