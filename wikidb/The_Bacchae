53.9	The_Bacchae	The Bacchae	The Bacchae is an ancient Greek tragedy by the Athenian playwright Euripides, during his final years in Macedon, at the court of Archelaus I of Macedon. It premiered posthumously at the Theatre of Dionysus in 405 BC as part of a tetralogy that also included Iphigeneia at Aulis and Alcmaeon in Corinth, and which Euripides' son or nephew probably directed. It won first prize in the City Dionysia festival competition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Death_Pentheus_Louvre_G445.jpg/200px-Death_Pentheus_Louvre_G445.jpg
