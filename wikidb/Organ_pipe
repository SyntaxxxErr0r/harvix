10.22	Organ_pipe	Organ pipe	An organ pipe is a sound-producing element of the pipe organ that resonates at a specific pitch when pressurized air (commonly referred to as wind) is driven through it. Each pipe is tuned to a specific note of the musical scale. A set of organ pipes of similar timbre tuned to a scale is known as a rank or a stop.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/StRaphaelsDubOrganSmall.jpg/300px-StRaphaelsDubOrganSmall.jpg
