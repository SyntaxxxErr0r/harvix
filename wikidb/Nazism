219.2	Nazism	Nazism	Nazism, the common short form name of National Socialism was the ideology and practice of the Nazi Party and of Nazi Germany. It is a unique variety of fascism that incorporates biological racism and antisemitism. Nazism was founded out of elements of the far-right racist völkisch German nationalist movement and the violent anti-communist Freikorps paramilitary culture that fought against the uprisings of communist revolutionaries in post-World War I Germany. The ideology was developed first by Anton Drexler and then Adolf Hitler as a means to draw workers away from communism and into völkisch nationalism. Initially Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric, though such aspects were later downplayed in the 1930s to gain the support from industrial owners for the Nazis; focus was shifted to anti-Semitic and anti-Marxist themes. Nazism promoted political violence, militarism, and war, it conceived of politics as being a "battle", and the Nazis utilized their paramilitary organization, the Sturmabteilung (SA) for violent attacks upon those they opposed, particularly communists, Jews, and social democrats. Hitler and the Nazis openly promoted German territorial expansionism into Eastern Europe to be Lebensraum ("living space") for German settlers and assimilation of Germanic peoples into Germans that would result in the creation of a "Greater Germanic Realm of the German Nation".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_the_NSDAP_%281920%E2%80%931945%29.svg/150px-Flag_of_the_NSDAP_%281920%E2%80%931945%29.svg.png
