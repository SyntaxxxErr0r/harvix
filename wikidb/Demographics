102.3	Demographics	Demographics	Demographics are the most recent statistical characteristics of a population. These types of data are used widely in sociology (and especially in the subfield of demography), public policy, and marketing. Commonly examined demographics include gender, race, age, disabilities, mobility, home ownership, employment status, and even location. Demographic trends describe the historical changes in demographics in a population over time (for example, the average age of a population may increase or decrease over time). Both distributions and trends of values within a demographic variable are of interest. Demographics are about the population of a region and the culture of the people there.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Race_and_ethnicity_Houston.png/220px-Race_and_ethnicity_Houston.png
