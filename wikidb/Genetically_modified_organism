196.8	Genetically_modified_organism	Genetically modified organism	A genetically modified organism (GMO) or genetically engineered organism (GEO) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. These techniques, generally known as recombinant DNA technology, use DNA molecules from different sources, which are combined into one molecule to create a new set of genes. This DNA is then transferred into an organism, giving it modified or novel genes. Transgenic organisms, a subset of GMOs, are organisms that have inserted DNA from a different species. GMOs are the constituents of genetically modified foods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/GloFish.jpg/220px-GloFish.jpg
