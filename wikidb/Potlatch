64.6	Potlatch	Potlatch	A potlatch is a gift-giving festival and primary economic system practiced by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of Canada and United States. This includes Heiltsuk Nation, Haida, Nuxalk, Tlingit, Makah, Tsimshian, Nuu-chah-nulth, Kwakwaka'wakw, and Coast Salish cultures. The word comes from the Chinook Jargon, meaning "to give away" or "a gift"; originally from the Nuu-chah-nulth word p̓ačiƛ, to make a ceremonial gift in a potlatch. It went through a history of rigorous ban by both the Canadian and United States' federal governments, and has been the study of many anthropologists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Wawadit%27la%28Mungo_Martin_House%29_a_Kwakwaka%27wakw_big_house.jpg/250px-Wawadit%27la%28Mungo_Martin_House%29_a_Kwakwaka%27wakw_big_house.jpg
