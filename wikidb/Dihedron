2.10	Dihedron	Dihedron	A dihedron is a type of polyhedron, made of two polygon faces which share the same set of edges. In three-dimensional Euclidean space, it is degenerate if its faces are flat, while in three-dimensional spherical space, a dihedron with flat faces can be thought of as a lens, an example of which is the fundamental domain of a lens space L .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Hexagonal_dihedron.png/220px-Hexagonal_dihedron.png
