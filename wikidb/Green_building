120.8	Green_building	Green building	Green building (also known as green construction or sustainable building) refers to a structure and using process that is environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/U.S._EPA_Kansas_City_Science_and_Technology_Center.jpg/280px-U.S._EPA_Kansas_City_Science_and_Technology_Center.jpg
