79.5	Numerical_control	Numerical control	Numerical control refers to the automation of machine tools that are operated by abstractly programmed commands encoded on a storage medium, as opposed to controlled manually via handwheels or levers, or mechanically automated via cams alone. The first NC machines were built in the 1940s and 1950s, based on existing tools that were modified with motors that moved the controls to follow points fed into the system on punched tape. These early servomechanisms were rapidly augmented with analog and digital computers, creating the modern computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools that have revolutionized the machining processes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Small_CNC_Turning_Center.jpg/220px-Small_CNC_Turning_Center.jpg
