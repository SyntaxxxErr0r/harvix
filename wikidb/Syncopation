62.4	Syncopation	Syncopation	In music, syncopation includes a variety of rhythms which are in some way unexpected which make an off-beat tune or piece of music. More simply, syncopation is a general term for a disturbance or interruption of the regular flow of rhythm: a placement of rhythmic stresses or accents where they wouldn't normally occur.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/Beethoven_-_String_Quartet_in_A_Major%2C_m._7-8_syncopation.png/220px-Beethoven_-_String_Quartet_in_A_Major%2C_m._7-8_syncopation.png
