195.2	Jimi_Hendrix	Jimi Hendrix	James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 â€“ September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist and singer-songwriter. He is widely considered to be the greatest electric guitarist in music history, and one of the most influential musicians of his era. After initial success in Europe with his group The Jimi Hendrix Experience, he achieved fame in the United States following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. He often favored raw overdriven amplifiers with high gain and treble and helped develop the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Jimi_Hendrix_1967.png/200px-Jimi_Hendrix_1967.png
