Letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices and two Democratic U.S. Senators, killing five people and infecting 17 others. According to the FBI, the ensuing investigation became "one of the largest and most complex in the history of law enforcement."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Daschle_letter.jpg/220px-Daschle_letter.jpg
