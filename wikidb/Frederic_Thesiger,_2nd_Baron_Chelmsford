1.00	Frederic_Thesiger,_2nd_Baron_Chelmsford	Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford	General Frederic Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford GCB, GCVO, (31 May 1827 â€“ 9 April 1905) was a British general, best known for his commanding role during the Anglo-Zulu war. The centre column of his forces was defeated at the Battle of Isandlwana, a crushing victory for the Zulus and the British army's worst ever defeat against a technologically inferior indigenous force. He would avenge his defeat at the Battle of Ulundi, which effectively ended the Zulu campaign. He was awarded the GCB in August 1879.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/2ndLordChelmsford.jpg
