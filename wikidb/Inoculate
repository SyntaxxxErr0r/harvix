3.10	Inoculate	Inoculation	Inoculation is the placement of something that will grow or reproduce, and is most commonly used in respect of the introduction of a serum, vaccine, or antigenic substance into the body of a human or animal, especially to produce or boost immunity to a specific disease. It can also be used to refer to the communication of a disease to a living organism by transferring its causative agent into the organism, the implanting of microorganisms or infectious material into a culture medium such as a brewers vat or a petri dish, or the placement of microorganisms or viruses at a site where infection is possible. The verb to inoculate is from Middle English inoculaten, which meant "to graft a scion" (a scion is a plant part to be grafted onto another plant); which in turn is from Latin inoculare, past participle inoculat-.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Variolation_vial_India.jpg/170px-Variolation_vial_India.jpg
