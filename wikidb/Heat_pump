52.8	Heat_pump	Heat pump	A heat pump is a machine or device that transfers thermal energy from one location, called the "source," which is at a lower temperature, to another location called the "sink" or "heat sink", which is at a higher temperature. Thus, heat pumps move thermal energy opposite to the direction that it normally flows. While compressor-driven air conditioners and freezers are technically heat pumps, the class includes many other types of devices, and the term "heat pump" usually implies one of the less-common devices in the class that are not dedicated to refrigeration-only.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Heat_Pump.jpg/265px-Heat_Pump.jpg
