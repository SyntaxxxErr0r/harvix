56.4	Carrie_Prejean	Carrie Prejean	Caroline Michelle "Carrie" Prejean Boller (born May 13, 1987) is an American model, author, former Miss California USA 2009 and Miss USA 2009 first runner-up. Prejean received national attention in 2009 when she told a pageant judge that marriage should be between a man and a woman; pageant judge and gossip blogger Perez Hilton used his final question in the Miss USA pageant to ask Prejean about same-sex marriage laws in the United States, and used his popular gossip blog to publicize her response. Hilton, who is gay, thought that her views were prejudiced. Later, Prejean was stripped of her Miss California USA crown for alleged breaches of contract. Contentious litigation between Prejean and the Miss California organization was settled in November 2009. Later that month, Prejean released a book relating the story from her point of view.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Carrie_Prejean_Miss_California.jpg/220px-Carrie_Prejean_Miss_California.jpg
