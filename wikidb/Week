60.7	Week	Week	A week is a time unit equal to seven days. The English word week continues an Old English wice, ultimately from a Common Germanic , from a root "turn, move, change". The Germanic word probably had a wider meaning prior to the adoption of the Roman calendar, perhaps "succession series", as suggested by Gothic wik≈ç translating taxis "order" in Luke 1:8. The term "week" is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days. Such "weeks" of between four and ten days have been used historically in various places. Intervals longer than 10 days are not usually termed "weeks" as they are closer in length to the fortnight or the month than to the seven-day week.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Revolution_kalendar.jpg/220px-Revolution_kalendar.jpg
