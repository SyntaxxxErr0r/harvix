2.00	Tae_kyon	Taekkyeon	Taekkyeon is a traditional Korean martial art with a dance-like appearance in some aspects. A Goguryeo mural painting at the Samsil tomb shows Taekkyeon was practiced as early as the Three Kingdoms Era and transmitted from Goguryeo to Shilla. The earliest existing written source mentioning Taekkyeon is the book Manmulmo (also Jaemulmo), written around 1790 by Lee, Sung-Ji. Taekkyeon is also frequently romanized informally as Taekkyon or Taekyon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Korean_martial_art-Taekkyeon-02.jpg/200px-Korean_martial_art-Taekkyeon-02.jpg
