12.00	Fantasy_Gardens	Fantasy Gardens	Fantasy Gardens, also known as Fantasy Garden World, was a former amusement park in Richmond, British Columbia that was located at the corner of Steveston Highway and No. 5 Road. The park was called Fantasy Gardens because it was surrounded by a series of stone buildings that were designed to resemble structures built during the Middle Ages. The buildings had been used as a backdrop in numerous music videos, television productions, and movies (it stood in for Halloweentown in Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Fg-windmill1.jpg/120px-Fg-windmill1.jpg
