88.9	Hebrew_calendar	Hebrew calendar	The Hebrew calendar ( ha'luach ha'ivri), or Jewish calendar, is a lunisolar calendar used today predominantly for Jewish religious observances. It determines the dates for Jewish holidays and the appropriate public reading of Torah portions, yahrzeits (dates to commemorate the death of a relative), and daily Psalm reading, among many ceremonial uses. In Israel, it is an official calendar for civil purposes and provides a time frame for agriculture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Maurice_Ascalon_Shabbat_Candle_Sticks.jpg/250px-Maurice_Ascalon_Shabbat_Candle_Sticks.jpg
