271.8	Cognitive_dissonance	Cognitive dissonance	Cognitive dissonance is a discomfort caused by holding conflicting cognitions (e.g., ideas, beliefs, values, emotional reactions) simultaneously. In a state of dissonance, people may feel surprise, dread, guilt, anger, or embarrassment. The theory of cognitive dissonance in social psychology proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance by altering existing cognitions or adding new ones to create a consistent belief system. An example of this would be the conflict between wanting to smoke and knowing that smoking is unhealthy; a person may try to change their feelings about the odds that they will actually suffer the consequences, or they might add the consonant element that the smoking is worth short term benefits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes_-_Project_Gutenberg_etext_19994.jpg/200px-The_Fox_and_the_Grapes_-_Project_Gutenberg_etext_19994.jpg
