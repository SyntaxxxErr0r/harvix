133.8	El_Ni%C3%B1o-Southern_Oscillation	El Niño-Southern Oscillation	El Niño/La Niña-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, is a quasiperiodic climate pattern that occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean roughly every five years. The Southern Oscillation refers to variations in the temperature of the surface of the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (warming and cooling known as El Niño and La Niña respectively) and in air surface pressure in the tropical western Pacific. The two variations are coupled: the warm oceanic phase, El Niño, accompanies high air surface pressure in the western Pacific, while the cold phase, La Niña, accompanies low air surface pressure in the western Pacific. Mechanisms that cause the oscillation remain under study.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/1997_El_Nino_TOPEX.jpg/200px-1997_El_Nino_TOPEX.jpg
