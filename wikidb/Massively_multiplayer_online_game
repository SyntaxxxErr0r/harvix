By necessity, they are played on the Internet, and usually feature at least one persistent world. They are, however, not necessarily games played on personal computers. Most of the newer game consoles, including the PSP, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo DS and Wii can access the Internet and may therefore run MMO games. Additionally, mobile devices and smartphones based on such operating systems as Android, iOS and Windows Phone are seeing an increase in the number of MMO games available.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Memorial_gathering-WW2_Online.jpg/250px-Memorial_gathering-WW2_Online.jpg
