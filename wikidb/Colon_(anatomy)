63.2	Colon_(anatomy)	Colon (anatomy)	The colon is the last part of the digestive system in most vertebrates; it extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body, and is the site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs. Unlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients. However, the colon does absorb water, sodium and some fat soluble vitamins.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Gray1223.png/250px-Gray1223.png
