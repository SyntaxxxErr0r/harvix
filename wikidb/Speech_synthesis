133.7	Speech_synthesis	Speech synthesis	Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. A computer system used for this purpose is called a speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware. A text-to-speech (TTS) system converts normal language text into speech; other systems render symbolic linguistic representations like phonetic transcriptions into speech.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Stephen_Hawking.StarChild.jpg/220px-Stephen_Hawking.StarChild.jpg
