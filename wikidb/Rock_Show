The single was released in the US on 27 October 1975 and in the UK on 28 November 1975. The B-side was "Magneto and Titanium Man", another track from the album. The single version is considerably shorter than the album version of the songs; in the single "Rock Show" is cut by more than 3 minutes and "Venus and Mars" is cut by a few seconds. "Venus and Mars/Rock Show" peaked at #12 but failed to chart on the UK singles chart. In the book The Rough Guide to the Beatles, Chris Ingham praised both songs, describing "Venus and Mars" as "atmospheric" and "Rock Show" as "barnstorming."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/62706vam.jpg/220px-62706vam.jpg
