53.0	Potassium_iodide	Potassium iodide	Potassium iodide is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula KI. This white salt is the most commercially significant iodide compound, with approximately 37,000 tons produced in 1985. It is less hygroscopic (absorbs water less readily) than sodium iodide, making it easier to work with. Aged and impure samples are yellow because of aerial oxidation of the iodide to elemental iodine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Potassium_iodide.jpg/200px-Potassium_iodide.jpg
