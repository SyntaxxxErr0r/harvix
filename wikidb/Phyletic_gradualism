13.41	Phyletic_gradualism	Phyletic gradualism	Phyletic gradualism is a model of evolution which theorizes that most speciation is slow, uniform and gradual. When evolution occurs in this mode, it is usually by the steady transformation of a whole species into a new one (through a process called anagenesis). In this view there is no clear line of demarcation between an ancestral species and a descendant species, unless splitting occurs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Punctuated-equilibrium.svg/300px-Punctuated-equilibrium.svg.png
