2.30	Neo-Riemannian_theory	Neo-Riemannian theory	Neo-Riemannian theory is named after Hugo Riemann (1849-1919), whose "dualist" system for relating triads was adapted from earlier 19th-century harmonic theorists. (The term "dualism" refers to the emphasis on the inversional relationship between major and minor, with minor triads being considered "upside down" versions of major triads; this "dualism" is what produces the change-in-direction described above. See also: Utonality) In the 1880's, Riemann proposed a system of transformations that related triads directly to each other The revival of this aspect of Riemann's writings, independently of the dualist premises under which they were initially conceived, originated with David Lewin (1933-2003), particularly in his article "Amfortas's Prayer to Titurel and the Role of D in Parsifal" (1984) and his influential book, Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations (1987). Subsequent development in the 1990s and 2000s has expanded the scope of neo-Riemannian theory considerably, with further mathematical systematization to its basic tenets, as well as inroads into 20th century repertoires and music psychology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Minor_as_upside_down_major.png/350px-Minor_as_upside_down_major.png
