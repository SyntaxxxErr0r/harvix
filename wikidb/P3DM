2.10	P3DM	Participatory 3D modelling (P3DM)	Participatory 3D modelling (P3DM) is a community-based mapping method which integrates local spatial knowledge with data on elevation of the land and depth of the sea to produce stand-alone, scaled and geo-referenced relief models. Essentially based on local spatial knowledge, land use and cover, and other features are depicted by informants on the model by the use of pushpins (points), yarns (lines) and paints (polygons). On completion, a scaled and geo-referenced grid is applied to facilitate data extraction or importation. Data depicted on the model are extracted, digitised and plotted. On completion of the exercise the model remains with the community.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Pic_367_nessuit.JPG/220px-Pic_367_nessuit.JPG
