Ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics. There are also disagreements about how such a society might be brought about, with some anarchists being committed to a strategy of nonviolence, while others advocate armed struggle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Anarchy-symbol.svg/125px-Anarchy-symbol.svg.png
