The fighting occurred south of Nazareth, with the French having such an advantage in terms of guns and artillery that Amir Rabah, the leader of the Beni Saqr, commenting on the effectiveness of his spear, said that he "could not swin in hell with a stick."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Al_Faiz.jpg/220px-Al_Faiz.jpg
