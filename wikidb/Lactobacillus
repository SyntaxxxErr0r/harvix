65.3	Lactobacillus	Lactobacillus	Lactobacillus, also called DÃ¶derlein's bacillus, is a genus of Gram-positive facultative anaerobic or microaerophilic rod-shaped bacteria. They are a major part of the lactic acid bacteria group, named as such because most of its members convert lactose and other sugars to lactic acid. In humans they are present in the vagina and the gastrointestinal tract, where they are symbiotic and make up a small portion of the gut flora. They are usually benign, except in the mouth where they have been associated with cavities and tooth decay . Many species are prominent in decaying plant material. The production of lactic acid makes its environment acidic, which inhibits the growth of some harmful bacteria. Several members of the genus have had their genome sequenced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Lactobacillus_sp_01.png/240px-Lactobacillus_sp_01.png
