74.9	Traumatic_brain_injury	Traumatic brain injury	Traumatic brain injury , also known as intracranial injury, occurs when an external force traumatically injures the brain. TBI can be classified based on severity, mechanism (closed or penetrating head injury), or other features (e.g., occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area). Head injury usually refers to TBI, but is a broader category because it can involve damage to structures other than the brain, such as the scalp and skull.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Brain_trauma_CT.jpg/230px-Brain_trauma_CT.jpg
