1.10	River_Spodden	River Spodden	The River Spodden is a watercourse in North West England. It rises in the Lancashire Pennine hills above Whitworth and proceeds south through Healey Dell and on to Rochdale, Greater Manchester, where the river merges with the River Roch. Nestled within the picturesque wooded valley is the site of what was the worldâ€™s largest asbestos textile factory, Turner Brothers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Whitworth4.jpg/256px-Whitworth4.jpg
