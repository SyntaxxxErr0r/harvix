1.00	Sophia,_Electress_of_Hanover	Sophia of Hanover	Sophia of the Palatinate (commonly referred to as Sophia of Hanover; 14 October 1630 â€“ 8 June 1714) was the Electress of Hanover from 1692 to 1698. She was also an heiress to the crowns of England and Ireland and later the crown of Great Britain, a country she never visited. She was declared heiress presumptive to Queen Anne of England, Ireland and Scotland by the Act of Settlement 1701, which was passed by the English parliament, and therefore only applied to the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and the Kingdom of Ireland. A few years later, the Kingdom of Scotland agreed to accept the Hanoverian succession for the new single throne of a new country, the Kingdom of Great Britain that Scotland and England had agreed to unite as, and which came into being under the Acts of Union, 1707. Sophia, a granddaughter of James VI and I, died less than two months before she would have become queen; her claim to the thrones passed on to her eldest son, George Louis, Elector of Hanover, who ascended them as George I on 1 August 1714 Old Style.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Sophie_von_der_Pfalz_als_Indianerin.jpg/200px-Sophie_von_der_Pfalz_als_Indianerin.jpg
