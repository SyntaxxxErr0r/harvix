78.1	Electrical_resistance	Electrical resistance and conductance	The electrical resistance of an electrical element is the opposition to the passage of an electric current through that element; the inverse quantity is electrical conductance, the ease at which an electric current passes. Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the mechanical notion of friction. The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm , while electrical conductance is measured in siemens (S).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg/220px-VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png
