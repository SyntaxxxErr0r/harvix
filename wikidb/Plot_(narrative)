55.9	Plot_(narrative)	Plot (narrative)	In his Poetics, Aristotle considered plot ("mythos") the most important element of dramaâ€”more important than character, for example. A plot must have, Aristotle says, a beginning, a middle, and an end, and the events of the plot must causally relate to one another as being either necessary, or probable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Freytags_pyramid.svg/265px-Freytags_pyramid.svg.png
