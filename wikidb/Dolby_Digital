Except for Dolby TrueHD, the audio compression is lossy. The first use of Dolby Digital was to provide digital sound in cinemas from 35mm film prints. It is now also used for other applications such as HDTV broadcast, DVDs, Blu-ray discs and game consoles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/34/Dolby-Digital.svg/220px-Dolby-Digital.svg.png
