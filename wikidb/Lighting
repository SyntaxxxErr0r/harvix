70.8	Lighting	Lighting	Lighting or illumination is the deliberate application of light to achieve some practical or aesthetic effect. Lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources such as lamps and light fixtures, as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight. Daylighting (using windows, skylights, or light shelves) is often used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings. This can save energy compared with artificial lighting, which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings. Without proper design, energy can be wasted by using too much light, or using out-dated technology. Proper lighting can enhance task performance, improve the appearance of an area, and have positive psychological effects on occupants. One of the core tenets of proper lighting is uniform illumination, which is required in many applications such as projection displays, LCD backlights, medical lighting, microscopy, solid-state lighting, and general lighting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Classical_spectacular_laser_effects.jpg/300px-Classical_spectacular_laser_effects.jpg
