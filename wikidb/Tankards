2.00	Tankards	Tankard	A tankard is a form of drinkware consisting of a large, roughly cylindrical, drinking cup with a single handle. Tankards are usually made of silver, pewter, or glass, but can be made of other materials, for example wood, ceramic or leather. A tankard may have a hinged lid, and tankards featuring glass bottoms are also fairly common. Tankards are shaped and used similarly to beer steins.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Tankard_%28PSF%29.png/170px-Tankard_%28PSF%29.png
