139.1	Caliphate	Caliphate	The term caliphate, "dominion of a caliph ('successor')" (from the Arabic خلافة or khilāfa, Turkish: ), refers to the first system of government established in Islam and represented the leaders unity of the Muslim Ummah (community). In theory, it is an aristocratic–constitutional republic (the Constitution being the Constitution of Medina), which means that the head of state, the Caliph, and other officials are representatives of the people and of Islam and must govern according to constitutional and religious law, or Sharia. In its early days, it resembled elements of direct democracy (see shura) and an elective monarchy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/AbdulmecidII.jpg
