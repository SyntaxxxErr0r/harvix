64.1	Conscription	Conscription	Conscription is the compulsory enlistment of people in some sort of national service, most often military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1â€“3 years on active duty, then transfer to the reserve force.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg/500px-Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg.png
