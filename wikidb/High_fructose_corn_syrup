In the United States, consumer foods and products typically use high-fructose corn syrup as a sweetener. It has become very common in processed foods and beverages in the U.S., including breads, cereals, breakfast bars, lunch meats, yogurts, soups, and condiments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/D-Fructose_vs._D-Glucose_Structural_Formulae_V.1.svg/220px-D-Fructose_vs._D-Glucose_Structural_Formulae_V.1.svg.png
