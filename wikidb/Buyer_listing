2.00	Buyer_listing	Buyer listing	A buyer listing is an agreement between a real estate agent and a prospective home or property buyer under which this "Buyer Agent" agrees to assist the Buyer in locating and contracting to purchase real estate, in exchange for a commission. Generally required to be in writing by law and/or professional rules (using a "Buyer Agency Agreement"), a Buyer Listing can also be described as the representative counterweight to the "Seller/Property Listing" arrangement between Listings Agents and Sellers. A Buyer Listing arrangement may be entered into a buyer listing service ("BLS") in the same way that a Property, Home or Seller Listing is entered into the Multiple (Sellers') Listing Service ("MLS"). Buyer Listing practices have become the predominant form of Agent selling (versus 'listing') activities since their advent in the early 1990s.
