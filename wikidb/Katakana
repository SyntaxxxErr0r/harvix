89.7	Katakana	Katakana	Katakana かたかな) is a Japanese syllabary, one component of the Japanese writing system along with hiragana, kanji, and in some cases the Latin alphabet . The word katakana means "fragmentary kana", as the katakana scripts are derived from components of more complex kanji. Each kana represents one mora. Each kana is either a vowel such as "a" (ア); a consonant followed by a vowel such as "ka" (カ); or "n" (ン), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English m, n, or ng (), or like the nasal vowels of French.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Japanese_Katakana_KA.png/100px-Japanese_Katakana_KA.png
