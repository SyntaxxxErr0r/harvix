61.0	Bulimia_nervosa	Bulimia nervosa	Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating and purging or consuming a large amount of food in a short amount of time, followed by an attempt to rid oneself of the food consumed, usually by purging (vomiting) and/or by laxative, diuretics or excessive exercise. Bulimia nervosa is nine times more likely to occur in women than men (Barker 2003),even though vast majority of those with bulimia nervosa are at normal weight. Antidepressants, especially SSRIs, are widely used in the treatment of bulimia nervosa (Newell and Gournay 2000). Patients who have bulimia nervosa are often linked with having impulsive behaviors involving over spending and sexual behaviors as well as having family histories of alcohol and substance abuse, mood and eating disorders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Oral_Manifestation_of_Bulimia..jpg/220px-Oral_Manifestation_of_Bulimia..jpg
