3.00	Elements_of_fiction	Fiction	Fiction is the form of any narrative or informative work that deals, in part or in whole, with information or events that are not factual, but rather, imaginaryâ€”that is, invented by the author. Although fiction describes a major branch of literary work, it may also refer to theatrical, cinematic or musical work. Fiction contrasts with non-fiction, which deals exclusively with factual (or, at least, assumed factual) events, descriptions, observations, etc. (e.g., biographies, histories).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Alice_par_John_Tenniel_30.png/220px-Alice_par_John_Tenniel_30.png
