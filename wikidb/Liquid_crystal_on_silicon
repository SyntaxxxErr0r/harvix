23.81	Liquid_crystal_on_silicon	Liquid crystal on silicon	Liquid crystal on silicon is a "micro-projection" or "micro-display" technology typically applied in projection televisions. It is a reflective technology similar to DLP projectors; however, it uses liquid crystals instead of individual mirrors. By way of comparison, LCD projectors use transmissive LCD chips, allowing light to pass through the liquid crystal. In LCoS, liquid crystals are applied directly to the surface of a silicon chip coated with an aluminized layer, with some type of passivation layer, which is highly reflective.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Lcos.svg/300px-Lcos.svg.png
