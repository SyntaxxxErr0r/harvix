67.0	Finite_element_method	Finite element method	The finite element method (FEM) (its practical application often known as finite element analysis (FEA)) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDE) as well as integral equations. The solution approach is based either on eliminating the differential equation completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an approximating system of ordinary differential equations, which are then numerically integrated using standard techniques such as Euler's method, Runge-Kutta, etc.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/FEM_example_of_2D_solution.png/220px-FEM_example_of_2D_solution.png
