1.10	Operation_Sailor_Hat	Operation Sailor Hat	Operation Sailor Hat was an explosives effects test conducted by the United States Navy on the island of Kahoolawe, Hawaii in 1965. As they were not nuclear tests, they instead employed conventional explosives (i.e. TNT) to simulate the effects of a nuclear weapon blast. The purpose of these three tests was to study the effects of shock and blast of a nuclear explosion on naval vessels. In addition, seismological data, underwater acoustics, radio communications, cratering, air blast effects, cloud growth, fire ball generation, and electromagnetic data were gathered. The former light cruisers USS Atlanta (CL-104) and USS England (DLG-22), the guided-missile destroyers USS Cochrane (DDG-21), USS Benjamin Stoddert (DDG-22), USS Dale (DLG-19), USS Towers (DDG-9), and the Canadian Navy's escort destroyer HMCS Fraser (DDH 233) all participated in the trial.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Sailor_Hat_Shot.jpg/180px-Sailor_Hat_Shot.jpg
