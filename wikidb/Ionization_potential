6.43	Ionization_potential	Ionization energy	The ionization energy of a chemical species, i.e. an atom or molecule, is the energy required to remove electrons from gaseous atoms or ions. The property is alternately still often called the ionization potential, measured in volts. In chemistry it often refers to one mole of a substance (molar ionization energy or enthalpy) and reported in kJ/mol. In atomic physics the ionization energy is typically measured in the unit electron volt (eV). Large atoms or molecules have a low ionization energy, while small molecules tend to have higher ionization energies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Electron_binding_energy_vs_Z.jpg/200px-Electron_binding_energy_vs_Z.jpg
