According to the songwriter Doc Pomus, "Rock and roll would have never happened without him." Although he came to his greatest fame in the 1950s with his pioneering rock and roll recordings, particularly "Shake, Rattle and Roll", Turner's career as a performer stretched from the 1920s into the 1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Big_Joe_Turner%2C_Hamburg_1974_%28Heinrich_Klaffs_Collection_86%29.jpg/220px-Big_Joe_Turner%2C_Hamburg_1974_%28Heinrich_Klaffs_Collection_86%29.jpg
