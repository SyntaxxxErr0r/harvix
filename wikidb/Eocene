60.1	Eocene	Eocene	The Eocene (symbol EO) Epoch, lasting from about 56 to 34 million years ago , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Palaeocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by the emergence of the first modern mammals. The end is set at a major extinction event called the Grande Coupure (the "Great Break" in continuity) or the Eoceneâ€“Oligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Paleogene-EoceneGlobal.jpg/220px-Paleogene-EoceneGlobal.jpg
