134.8	Value_added_tax	Value added tax	A value added tax or value-added tax is a form of consumption tax. From the perspective of the buyer, it is a tax on the purchase price. From that of the seller, it is a tax only on the "value added" to a product, material or service, from an accounting point of view, by this stage of its manufacture or distribution. The manufacturer remits to the government the difference between these two amounts, and retains the rest for themselves to offset the taxes they had previously paid on the inputs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/TaxWithTax.svg/200px-TaxWithTax.svg.png
