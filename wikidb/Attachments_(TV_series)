It focuses on a group of young professionals in London that work for an Internet startup company called "seethru" during the dot com boom. The fictional company ran an internet portal website at seethru.co.uk which was updated as the show progressed, and which remained on-line for some time after the end of the second series. The show was criticised for being too offensive.
