1.10	Chopaka_Lake	Chopaka Lake	Chopaka Lake is a lake in Okanogan County, Washington. It covers an area of approximately 150 acres (0.6 km2), is over 70 ft (21 m) deep at its deepest point, and is 3,200 ft (975 m) in elevation. The lake's name is that of a legendary Okanogan hunter who was transformed to stone by Coyote. It serves as an irrigation reservoir for local ranchers. Because the lake has no natural outlet, its water level is controlled by a wooden weir at one end. Chopaka Lake is a favorite among fly fishers who cast for rainbow trout.
