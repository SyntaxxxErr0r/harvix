141.3	Solid-state_drive	Solid-state drive	A solid-state drive , sometimes called a solid-state disk or electronic disk, is a data storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently. SSD technology uses electronic interfaces compatible with traditional block I/O hard disk drives. SSDs do not employ any moving mechanical components, which distinguishes them from traditional magnetic disks such as hard disk drives (HDDs) or floppy disk, which are electromechanical devices containing spinning disks and movable read/write heads. Compared to electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically less susceptible to physical shock, are silent, have lower access time and latency, but are more expensive per unit of storage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Crucial_256GB_Solid_State_SATA_Hard_Drive.jpg/220px-Crucial_256GB_Solid_State_SATA_Hard_Drive.jpg
