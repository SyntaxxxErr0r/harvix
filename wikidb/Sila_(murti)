6.03	Sila_(murti)	Sila (murti)	Shila, (शिला in Devanagari, in IAST refers to a Vaishnava aniconic representation of Vishnu, in the form of a spherical, usually black-coloured stone found in the sacred river Gandaki. They are more often referred to as Shaligram Shilas, with Shila being the shortened version. The word Shila translates simply to 'stone' and Shaligram is a less well-known name of Vishnu. The origin of the name is traced to a remote village in Nepal where Vishnu is known by the name of Shaligraman.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Laksmi-Salagram.jpg/250px-Laksmi-Salagram.jpg
