2.00	MIMO_communications	MIMO	In radio, multiple-input and multiple-output, or MIMO , is the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance. It is one of several forms of smart antenna technology. Note that the terms input and output refer to the radio channel carrying the signal, not to the devices having antennas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Prinzip_MIMO.svg/280px-Prinzip_MIMO.svg.png
