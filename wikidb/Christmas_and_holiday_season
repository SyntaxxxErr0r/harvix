It is generally considered to run from late November to early January. Its relation to Christmas in official use by schools and governments has resulted in controversy in western countries. It incorporates a period of shopping which comprises a peak season for the retail sector (the "Christmas shopping season"), and a period of sales at the end of the season (the "January sales").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Christmas_tree_in_marunouchi.jpg/225px-Christmas_tree_in_marunouchi.jpg
