264.9	Taoism	Taoism	Taoism refers to a philosophy and a religious tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (ÈÅì), the source and essence of everything that exists. The Chinese word Tao (or Dao, depending on the romanization system used) is usually translated as "way", "path" or "principle", although this usage takes its meaning from "reality" or "nature", which the word Tao can also mean. The proper path in life, says Taoism, is one that works in harmony with reality, the essence of the natural universe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Dai_Temple_%281489%29.JPG/220px-Dai_Temple_%281489%29.JPG
