97.7	24_Hours_of_Le_Mans	24 Hours of Le Mans	The 24 Hours of Le Mans (French: ) is the world's oldest sports car race in endurance racing, held annually since 1923 near the town of Le Mans, France. Commonly known as the Grand Prix of Endurance and Efficiency, race teams have to balance speed against the cars' ability to run for 24 hours without sustaining mechanical damage to the car and manage the cars' consumables, primarily fuel, tyres and braking materials. The endurance of the drivers is likewise tested as drivers frequently spend stints of over two hours behind the wheel before stopping in the pits and allowing a relief driver to take over the driving duties. Drivers then grab what food and rest they can before returning to drive another stint. Today it is mandated that three drivers share each competing vehicle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Circuit_de_la_Sarthe_track_map.svg/250px-Circuit_de_la_Sarthe_track_map.svg.png
