113.8	Song	Song	In music, a song is a composition for voice or voices, performed by singing. A song may be accompanied by musical instruments, or it may be unaccompanied, as in the case of a cappella songs. The lyrics (words) of songs are typically of a poetic, rhyming nature, though they may be religious verses or free prose.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Ercole_de%27_Roberti_003.jpg/225px-Ercole_de%27_Roberti_003.jpg
