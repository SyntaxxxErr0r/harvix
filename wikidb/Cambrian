63.1	Cambrian	Cambrian	The Cambrian is the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, lasting from to million years ago (mya) ; it is succeeded by the Ordovician. Its subdivisions, and indeed its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latin name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerst√§tten. These are sites of exceptional preservation, where 'soft' parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. This means that our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/EarlyCambrianGlobal.jpg/240px-EarlyCambrianGlobal.jpg
