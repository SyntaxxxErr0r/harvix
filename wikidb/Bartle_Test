84.7	Bartle_Test	Bartle Test	The Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology is a series of questions and an accompanying scoring formula that classifies players of multiplayer online games (including MUDs and MMORPGs) into categories based on their gaming preferences. The test is based on a 1996 paper by Richard Bartle and was created in 1999â€“2000 by Erwin Andreasen and Brandon Downey. Although the test has met with some criticism for the dichotomous nature of its question-asking method, the test has been taken by a large number of computer game players. As of October 2011, the test had been taken over 700,000 times.
