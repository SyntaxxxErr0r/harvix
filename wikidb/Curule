2.00	Curule	Curule seat	In the Roman Republic, and later the Empire, the curule seat (sella curulis, supposedly from currus, "chariot") was the chair upon which senior magistrates or promagistrates owning imperium were entitled to sit, including dictators, masters of the horse, consuls, praetors, censors, and the curule aediles. Additionally, the Flamen of Jupiter (Flamen Dialis) was also allowed to sit on a sella curulis, though this position lacked imperium. Livy writes that the three flamines maiores or high priests of the Archaic Triad of major gods were each granted the honor of the curule chair.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Curule_chair%2C_sella_curulis%2C_Museo_Borbonico%2C_vol._vi._tav._28.gif/220px-Curule_chair%2C_sella_curulis%2C_Museo_Borbonico%2C_vol._vi._tav._28.gif
