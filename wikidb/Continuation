63.4	Continuation	Continuation	In computer science and programming, a continuation is an abstract representation of the control state of a computer program. A continuation reifies the program control state, i.e. the continuation is a data structure that represents the computational process at a given point in the process' execution; the created data structure can be accessed by the programming language, instead of being hidden in the runtime environment. It contains information such as the process' current stack (including all data whose lifetime is within the process e.g. "local variables"), as well as the process' point in the computation. An instance of continuation can be later used as a control structure; upon invocation, it will resume execution from the control point that it represents. The "current continuation" or "continuation of the computation step" is the continuation that, from the perspective of running code, would be derived from the current point in a program's execution.
