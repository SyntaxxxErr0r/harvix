99.3	Egg_(food)	Egg (food)	Eggs are laid by females of many different species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, and have probably been eaten by mankind for millennia. Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen , and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. Popular choices for egg consumption are chicken, duck, quail, roe, and caviar, but the egg most often consumed by humans is the chicken egg, by a wide margin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Coturnix_coturnix_eggs.jpg/300px-Coturnix_coturnix_eggs.jpg
