58.8	Rafael_Trujillo	Rafael Trujillo	Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo Molina , ruled the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961. He officially served as president from 1930 to 1938 and again from 1942 to 1952, otherwise ruling as an unelected military strongman. His 30 years in power, to Dominicans known as the Trujillo Era (Spanish: ), is considered one of the bloodiest ever in the Americas, as well as a time of a classic personality cult, when monuments to Trujillo were in abundance. It has been estimated that Trujillo's rule was responsible for the death of more than 50,000 people, including 20,000 to 30,000 in the infamous Parsley Massacre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Rafael_Trujillo.gif/200px-Rafael_Trujillo.gif
