1.00	Car_rentals	Car rental	A car rental or car hire agency is a company that rents automobiles for short periods of time (generally ranging from a few hours to a few weeks) for a fee. It is an elaborate form of a rental shop, often organized with numerous local branches (which allow a user to return a vehicle to a different location), and primarily located near airports or busy city areas and often complemented by a website allowing online reservations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Europcar_counter_MUC.JPG/220px-Europcar_counter_MUC.JPG
