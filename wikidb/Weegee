60.8	Weegee	Weegee	Weegee was the pseudonym of Arthur Fellig (June 12, 1899 â€“ December 26, 1968), a photographer and photojournalist, known for his stark black and white street photography. Weegee worked in the Lower East Side of New York City as a press photographer during the 1930s and '40s, and he developed his signature style by following the city's emergency services and documenting their activity. Much of his work depicted unflinchingly realistic scenes of urban life, crime, injury and death. Weegee published photographic books and also worked in cinema, initially making his own short films and later collaborating with film directors such as Jack Donohue and Stanley Kubrick.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Weegee_the_famous.TIF/lossy-page1-220px-Weegee_the_famous.TIF.jpg
