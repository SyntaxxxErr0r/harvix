89.5	Fenway_Park	Fenway Park	Fenway Park is a baseball park near Kenmore Square in Boston, Massachusetts. Located at 4 Yawkey Way, it has served as the home ballpark of the Boston Red Sox baseball club since it opened in 1912, and is the oldest Major League Baseball stadium currently in use. It is one of two "classic" ballparks still in use, the other being Chicago's Wrigley Field. Considered to be one of the best-known sports venues in the world, it has been the oldest venue used by a professional sports team in the United States since the ballpark it was tied with, Tiger Stadium in Detroit, was retired at the end of the 1999 season.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/ALE-BOS-Fenway.PNG/100px-ALE-BOS-Fenway.PNG
