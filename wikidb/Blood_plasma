73.2	Blood_plasma	Blood plasma	"Dried plasmas" were developed and first used in World War II. Prior to the United States' involvement in the war, liquid plasma and whole blood were used. The "Blood for Britain" program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on Dr. Charles Drew's contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Dr. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the "Plasma for Britain" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the test tube methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/95/Britain_and_us_plasma_packages_wwii.jpg/300px-Britain_and_us_plasma_packages_wwii.jpg
