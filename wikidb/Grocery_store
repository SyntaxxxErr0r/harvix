76.9	Grocery_store	Grocery store	A grocery store is a store that retails food. A grocer, the owner of a grocery store, stocks different kinds of foods from assorted places and cultures, and sells these "groceries" to customers. Large grocery stores that stock products other than food, such as clothing or household items, are called supermarkets. Small grocery stores that mainly sell fruits and vegetables are known as produce markets (U.S.) or greengrocers (Britain), and small grocery stores that predominantly sell snack foods and sandwiches are known as convenience stores or delicatessens.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Piggly-wiggly.jpg/220px-Piggly-wiggly.jpg
