10.71	Hakka_architecture	Hakka walled village	A Hakka walled village is a large multi-family communal living structure that is designed to be easily defensible. This building style is unique to the Hakka people found in southern China (Hakka is "Kè-jiā" 客家 in Chinese). Walled villages are typically designed for defensive purposes and consist of one entrance and no windows at the ground level.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Earth_building-fuyu.jpg/220px-Earth_building-fuyu.jpg
