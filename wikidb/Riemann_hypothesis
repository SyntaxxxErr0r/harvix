74.0	Riemann_hypothesis	Riemann hypothesis	In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis, proposed by Bernhard Riemann , is a conjecture about the location of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function which states that all non-trivial zeros (as defined below) have real part 1/2. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/RiemannCriticalLine.svg/220px-RiemannCriticalLine.svg.png
