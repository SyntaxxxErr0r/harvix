97.8	Function_(mathematics)	Function (mathematics)	In mathematics, a function is a correspondence between a set of inputs and a set of outputs that associates each input with exactly one output. More formally, a function is defined by a set of inputs, a set containing the outputs and a set of input-output pairs (the correspondence just referred to). The output of a function f corresponding to an input x is denoted by f (read "f of x").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Function_machine2.svg/220px-Function_machine2.svg.png
