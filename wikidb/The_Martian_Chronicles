53.0	The_Martian_Chronicles	The Martian Chronicles	The Martian Chronicles is a 1950 science fiction short story collection by Ray Bradbury that chronicles the colonization of Mars by humans fleeing from a troubled and eventually atomically devastated Earth, and the conflict between aboriginal Martians and the new colonists. The book lies somewhere between a short story collection and an episodic novel, containing stories Bradbury originally published in the late 1940s in science fiction magazines. For publication, the stories were loosely woven together with a series of short, interstitial vignettes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/The-Martian-Chronicles.jpg/200px-The-Martian-Chronicles.jpg
