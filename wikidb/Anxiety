162.8	Anxiety	Anxiety	Anxiety (also called angst or worry) is a psychological and physiological state characterized by somatic, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components. It is the displeasing feeling of fear and concern. The root meaning of the word anxiety is 'to vex or trouble'; in either presence or absence of psychological stress, anxiety can create feelings of fear, worry, uneasiness, and dread. Anxiety is considered to be a normal reaction to a stressor. It may help an individual to deal with a demanding situation by prompting them to cope with it. When anxiety becomes excessive, it may fall under the classification of an anxiety disorder.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Emperor_Traianus_Decius_%28Mary_Harrsch%29.jpg/250px-Emperor_Traianus_Decius_%28Mary_Harrsch%29.jpg
