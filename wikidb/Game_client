2.00	Game_client	Game client	A game client is a piece of software that connects to a game server. The server provides the connection and sends packets of information back to the game client. Many clients can be connected to the server at the same time, which will keep an overall view of the game world. Each game-client has its own unique world perspective. An example of this could be to download a game from the website to access its servers.
