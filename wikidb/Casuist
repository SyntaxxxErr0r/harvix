4.00	Casuist	Casuistry	Casuistry takes a relentlessly practical approach to morality. Rather than using theories as starting points, casuistry begins with an examination of cases. By drawing parallels between paradigms, so-called "pure cases", and the case at hand, a casuist tries to determine a moral response appropriate to a particular case.
