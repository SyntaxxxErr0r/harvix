3.21	Augmentation_(music)	Augmentation (music)	In Western music and music theory, the word augmentation (from Late Latin augmentare, to increase) has three distinct meanings. Augmentation is a compositional device where a melody, theme or motif is presented in longer note-values than were previously used. Augmentation is also the term for the proportional lengthening of the value of individual note-shapes in older notation by coloration, by use of a sign of proportion, or by a notational symbol such as the modern dot. A major or perfect interval that is widened by a chromatic semitone is an augmented interval, and the process may be called augmentation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Dotted_notes3.svg/190px-Dotted_notes3.svg.png
