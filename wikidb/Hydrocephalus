58.6	Hydrocephalus	Hydrocephalus	Hydrocephalus ( ), also known as "water in the brain," is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles, or cavities, of the brain. This may cause increased intracranial pressure inside the skull and progressive enlargement of the head, convulsion, tunnel vision, and mental disability. Hydrocephalus can also cause death. The name derives from the Greek words ὑδρο- (hydro-) "water", and κέφαλος (kephalos) "head".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Hydrocephalus.jpg/230px-Hydrocephalus.jpg
