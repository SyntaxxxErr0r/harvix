70.4	Bohemian_Rhapsody	Bohemian Rhapsody	"Bohemian Rhapsody" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. The song has no chorus, instead consisting of three main parts: a ballad segment ending with a guitar solo, an operatic passage, and a hard rock section. At the time, it was the most expensive single ever made and remains one of the most elaborate recordings in popular music history.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Bohemian_Rhapsody.png/220px-Bohemian_Rhapsody.png
