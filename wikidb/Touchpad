63.1	Touchpad	Touchpad	A touchpad (or trackpad) is a pointing device featuring a tactile sensor, a specialized surface that can translate the motion and position of a user's fingers to a relative position on screen. Touchpads are a common feature of laptop computers, and are also used as a substitute for a mouse where desk space is scarce. Because they vary in size, they can also be found on personal digital assistants (PDAs) and some portable media players. Wireless touchpads are also available as detached accessories.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Macbook_pro_trackpad.jpg/220px-Macbook_pro_trackpad.jpg
