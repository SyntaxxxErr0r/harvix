107.8	Favela	Favela	A favela is the generally used term for a shanty town in Brazil. In the late 18th century, the first settlements were called bairros africanos (African neighbourhoods). This was the place where former slaves with no land ownership and no options for work lived. Over the years, many freed black slaves moved in.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/1_rocinha_favela_closeup.JPG/220px-1_rocinha_favela_closeup.JPG
