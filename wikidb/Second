72.7	Second	Second	The second is the International System of Units (SI) base unit of time and also a unit of time in other systems (abbreviated s or sec). Between 1000 (when al-Biruni used seconds) and 1960 the second was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day (that definition still applies in some astronomical and legal contexts). Between 1960 and 1967, it was defined in terms of the period of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, but it is now defined more precisely in atomic terms. Seconds may be measured using mechanical, electric or atomic clocks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/FOCS-1.jpg/220px-FOCS-1.jpg
