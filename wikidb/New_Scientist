58.0	New_Scientist	New Scientist	New Scientist is a weekly non-peer-reviewed English-language international science magazine, which since 1996 has also run a website, covering recent developments in science and technology for a general audience. Founded in 1956, it is published by Reed Business Information Ltd, a subsidiary of Reed Elsevier. The company Albert E. Reed acquired New Scientist when it merged with IPC Magazines in 1970, retaining the magazine when it sold most of its consumer magazines in a management buyout to what is now IPC Media.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b8/New_Scientist_6_Feb_2010.jpg/150px-New_Scientist_6_Feb_2010.jpg
