101.8	Jesuit	Society of Jesus	The Society of Jesus is a Christian male religious order that follows the teachings of the Catholic Church. The members are called Jesuits and are also known colloquially as "God's Marines" and as "The Company", these being references to founder Ignatius of Loyola's military background and members' willingness to accept orders anywhere in the world and live in extreme conditions. The society is engaged in evangelization and apostolic ministry in 112 nations on six continents. The society's founding principles are contained in the document Formula of the Institute, written by Ignatius of Loyola. Jesuits are known for their work in education (founding schools, colleges, universities and seminaries), intellectual research, and cultural pursuits, and for their missionary efforts. Jesuits also give retreats, minister in hospitals and parishes and promote social justice and ecumenical dialogue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Ihs-logo.svg/235px-Ihs-logo.svg.png
