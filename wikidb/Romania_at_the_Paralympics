1.00	Romania_at_the_Paralympics	Romania at the Paralympics	Romania made its Paralympic Games d√©but at the 1972 Summer Paralympics in Heidelberg, sending a single representative to compete in table tennis. He was eliminated in his first match. The country was then absent from the Paralympics until the 1996 Summer Games, where it was again represented by a single competitor (Aurel Berbec in powerlifting). Romania was represented again by just one athlete in 2000, and two in 2004, but sent a larger delegation of five athletes to the 2008 Summer Games. Its most recent participation in the Paralympics was also its first in the Winter Games, in 2010. Its sole representative was Laura Valeanu, who entered two events in alpine skiing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/180px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png
