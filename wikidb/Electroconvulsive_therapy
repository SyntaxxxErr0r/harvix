78.8	Electroconvulsive_therapy	Electroconvulsive therapy	Electroconvulsive therapy , formerly known as electroshock, is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in anesthetized patients for therapeutic effect. Its mode of action is unknown. Today, ECT is most often recommended for use as a treatment for severe depression that has not responded to other treatment, and is also used in the treatment of mania and catatonia. It was first introduced in 1938 by Italian neuropsychiatrists Ugo Cerletti and Lucio Bini, and gained widespread use as a form of treatment in the 1940s and 1950s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Psychotron_7-10-2009_15-39-19.JPG/250px-Psychotron_7-10-2009_15-39-19.JPG
