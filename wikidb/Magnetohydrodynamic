2.01	Magnetohydrodynamic	Magnetohydrodynamics	Magnetohydrodynamics (magneto fluid dynamics or hydromagnetics) is an academic discipline which studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids. Examples of such fluids include plasmas, liquid metals, and salt water or electrolytes. The word magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is derived from magneto- meaning magnetic field, and hydro- meaning liquid, and -dynamics meaning movement. The field of MHD was initiated by Hannes Alfv√©n, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1970.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/M_Faraday_Th_Phillips_oil_1842.jpg/100px-M_Faraday_Th_Phillips_oil_1842.jpg
