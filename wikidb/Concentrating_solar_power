59.9	Concentrating_solar_power	Concentrated solar power	Concentrated solar power (also called concentrating solar power and CSP) systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, or solar thermal energy, onto a small area. Electrical power is produced when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine) connected to an electrical power generator.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/PS10_solar_power_tower.jpg/300px-PS10_solar_power_tower.jpg
