63.5	Public_library	Public library	A public library is a library that is accessible by the public and is generally funded from public sources (such as tax money) and operated by civil servants. There are five fundamental characteristics shared by public libraries. The first is that they are supported by taxes (usually local, though any level of government can and may contribute); they are governed by a board to serve the public interest; they are open to all and every community member can access the collection; they are entirely voluntary in that no one is ever forced to use the services provided; and public libraries provide basic services without charge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Toronto_Reference_Library%2C_exterior.jpg/220px-Toronto_Reference_Library%2C_exterior.jpg
