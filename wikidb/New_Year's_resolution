A key element to a New Year's Resolution that sets it apart from other resolutions is that it is made in anticipation of the New Year and new beginnings. People committing themselves to a New Year's resolution generally plan to do so for the whole following year. This lifestyle change is generally interpreted as advantageous.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Postcards2CardsNewYearsResolution1915.jpg/350px-Postcards2CardsNewYearsResolution1915.jpg
