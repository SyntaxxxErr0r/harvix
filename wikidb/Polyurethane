76.7	Polyurethane	Polyurethane	A polyurethane is polymer composed of a chain of organic units joined by carbamate (urethane) links. Polyurethane polymers are formed by combining two bi- or higher functional monomers. One contains two or more isocyanate functional groups and the other contains two or more hydroxyl groups. More complicated monomers are also used. The alcohol and the isocyanate groups combine to form a urethane linkage:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Polyurethane.png/360px-Polyurethane.png
