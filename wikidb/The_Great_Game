132.1	The_Great_Game	The Great Game	The Great Game or Tournament of Shadows in Russia were terms for the strategic rivalry and conflict between the British Empire and the Russian Empire for supremacy in Central Asia. The classic Great Game period is generally regarded as running approximately from the Russo-Persian Treaty of 1813 to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907. A second, less intensive phase followed the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The Great Game ended as the United Kingdom entered the post-WW2 post-colonial period.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Persia_1814.jpg/400px-Persia_1814.jpg
