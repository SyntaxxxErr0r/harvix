77.5	Anagram	Anagram	An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letter of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example orchestra can be rearranged into carthorse. Someone who creates anagrams is called an anagrammatist. The original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Anagram.jpg/280px-Anagram.jpg
