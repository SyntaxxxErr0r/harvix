3.20	Plebian	Plebs	The plebs was the general body of free land-owning Roman citizens (as distinguished from slaves and the capite censi) in Ancient Rome. Members of the plebs were also distinct from the higher order of the patricians. A member of the plebs was known as a plebeian (Latin: ). This term is used today to refer to one who is or appears to be of the middle or lower order; however, in Rome plebeians could become quite wealthy and influential. In fact, Nero, a Roman emperor, was born a "pleb". His success was not uncommon and approximately 30% of Roman emperors were "plebs".
