155.1	Bhagavad_Gita	Bhagavad Gita	The context of the Gita is a conversation between Lord Krishna and the Pandava prince Arjuna taking place in the middle of the battlefield before the start of the Kurukshetra War with armies on both sides ready to battle. Responding to Arjuna's confusion and moral dilemma about fighting his own cousins who command a tyranny imposed on a disputed empire, Lord Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and prince, and elaborates on yoga, Samkhya, reincarnation, moksha, karma yoga and jnana yoga among other topics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Krishna_and_Arjun_on_the_chariot%2C_Mahabharata%2C_18th-19th_century%2C_India.jpg/300px-Krishna_and_Arjun_on_the_chariot%2C_Mahabharata%2C_18th-19th_century%2C_India.jpg
