70.1	Pentium_4	Pentium 4	Pentium 4 was a line of single-core desktop and laptop central processing units (CPUs), introduced by Intel on November 20, 2000 and shipped through August 8, 2008. They had a 7th-generation x86 microarchitecture, called NetBurst, which was the company's first all-new design since the introduction of the P6 microarchitecture of the Pentium Pro CPUs in 1995. NetBurst differed from P6 (Pentium III, II, etc.) by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high clock speeds (up to 3.8 GHz) limited only by TDPs reaching up to 115 W in 3.4 GHz â€“3.8 GHz Prescott and Prescott 2M cores. In 2004, the initial 32-bit x86 instruction set of the Pentium 4 microprocessors was extended by the 64-bit x86-64 set. The performance difference between a Pentium III at 1.13 GHz and a Pentium 4 at 1.3 GHz would have been hardly noticeable. So the Pentium 4 clock frequency needed to be approximately 1.15 times that of a Pentium 3 to achieve the same performance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/34/Pentium4ds.jpg/220px-Pentium4ds.jpg
