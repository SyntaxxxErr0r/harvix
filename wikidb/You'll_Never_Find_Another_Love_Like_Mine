7.30	You'll_Never_Find_Another_Love_Like_Mine	You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine	"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine" (written by Kenny Gamble &amp; Leon Huff) is a song performed by R&amp;B singer Lou Rawls on his 1976 album All Things in Time. The song proved to be Rawls' breakthrough hit, reaching number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the R&amp;B and Easy Listening charts. The single also reached number four on the dance chart. It was the only Rawls' record to reach Billboard's pop top ten. It was the first big hit for Philadelphia International to feature the reformulated MFSB, after many of the original members left Gamble and Huff for better opportunities. The song started Rawls' live shows from 1977 on.
