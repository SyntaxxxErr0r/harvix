6.00	Invalid_carriage	Invalid carriage	An invalid carriage was a low cost, low maintenance vehicle, designed specifically for people with physical disabilities. The last ones were withdrawn from the road in 2003, 27 years after the end of production, though some are still in existence. One of those still existing is a 1976 example, one of the last made, which is on display at the National Motor Museum in Hampshire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/DDR_DUO_4_1_Invalid_tricycle_Aug_1989_%283830639655%29.jpg/220px-DDR_DUO_4_1_Invalid_tricycle_Aug_1989_%283830639655%29.jpg
