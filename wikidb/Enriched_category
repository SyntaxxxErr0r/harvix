3.10	Enriched_category	Enriched category	If we again restrict ourselves to the case where M is a monoidal category of sets and functions, the morphisms become functions from the one-point set I and must then, for any given object a, identify a particular element of each set C(a,a), something we can then think of as the "identity morphism for a in C". Commutativity of the latter two diagrams is then the statement that compositions (as defined by the functions Â°) involving these distinguished individual "identity morphisms in C" behave exactly as per the identity rules for ordinary categories.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Math-enriched_category_associativity.svg/493px-Math-enriched_category_associativity.svg.png
