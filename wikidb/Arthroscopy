49.32	Arthroscopy	Arthroscopy	Arthroscopy (also called arthroscopic surgery) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure in which an examination and sometimes treatment of damage of the interior of a joint is performed using an arthroscope, a type of endoscope that is inserted into the joint through a small incision. Arthroscopic procedures can be performed either to evaluate or to treat many orthopedic conditions including torn floating cartilage, torn surface cartilage, ACL reconstruction, and trimming damaged cartilage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Performing_shoulder_arthroscopy.jpg/230px-Performing_shoulder_arthroscopy.jpg
