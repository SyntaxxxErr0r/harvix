These started during the initial Muslim conquests under the expansionist Rashidun and Umayyad caliphs in the 7th century and continued by their successors until the mid-11th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg/300px-Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg
