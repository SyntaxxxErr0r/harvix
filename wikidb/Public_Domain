56.9	Public_Domain	Public domain	The public domain refers to works whose intellectual property rights have expired, been forfeited, or are inapplicable. Examples include the English language, the formulae of Newtonian physics, the works of Shakespeare and Beethoven, and the patents on powered flight. The term is not normally applied to situations when the creator of a work retains residual rights, in which case use of the work is referred to as "under license" or with permission.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/NewtonsPrincipia.jpg/200px-NewtonsPrincipia.jpg
