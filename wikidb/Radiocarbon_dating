138.6	Radiocarbon_dating	Radiocarbon dating	Carbon has two stable, nonradioactive isotopes: carbon-12 (), and carbon-13 (). In addition, there are trace amounts of the unstable isotope carbon-14 () on Earth. Carbon-14 has a relatively short half-life of 5,730 years, meaning that the amount of carbon-14 in a sample is halved over the course of 5,730 years due to radioactive decay. Carbon-14 would have long ago vanished from Earth were it not for the unremitting cosmic ray flux interactions with the Earth's atmosphere, which create more of the isotope. The neutrons resulting from the cosmic ray interactions participate in the following nuclear reaction on the atoms of nitrogen molecules () in the atmosphere:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Carbon_14_formation_and_decay.svg/220px-Carbon_14_formation_and_decay.svg.png
