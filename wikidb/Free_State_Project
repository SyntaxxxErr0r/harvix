35.48	Free_State_Project	Free State Project	The Free State Project is a political movement, founded in 2001, to recruit at least 20,000 libertarian-leaning people to move to a single low-population state (New Hampshire, selected in 2003) in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas. The project seeks to overcome the historical ineffectiveness of limited-government activism by the small, diffuse population of activists across the 50 United States and around the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/Free_State_Project_Logo.svg/200px-Free_State_Project_Logo.svg.png
