63.8	Category_5_cable	Category 5 cable	Category 5 cable is a twisted pair cable for carrying signals. This type of cable is used in structured cabling for computer networks such as Ethernet. It is also used to carry other signals such as telephony and video. The cable is commonly connected using punch down blocks and modular connectors. Most Category 5 cables are unshielded, relying on the twisted pair design and differential signaling for noise rejection. Category 5 has been superseded by the Category 5e (enhanced) specification.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Cat_5.jpg/300px-Cat_5.jpg
