61.1	2004_Madrid_train_bombings	2004 Madrid train bombings	The Madrid train bombings (also known in Spain as 11-M) were nearly simultaneous, coordinated bombings against the Cercanías system of Madrid, Spain on the morning of 11 March 2004 – three days before Spain's general elections. The explosions killed 191 people and wounded 1,800. The official investigation by the Spanish Judiciary determined the attacks were directed by an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist cell, although no direct al-Qaeda participation (only "inspiration") has been established. Though they had no role in the planning or implementation, the Spanish miners who sold the explosives to the terrorists were also arrested.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Puerta_de_Atocha.jpg/250px-Puerta_de_Atocha.jpg
