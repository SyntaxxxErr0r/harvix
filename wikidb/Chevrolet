85.1	Chevrolet	Chevrolet	Chevrolet ( ), also known as Chevy , is an American brand of vehicle produced by General Motors (GM). Founded by Louis Chevrolet and ousted GM founder William C. Durant on November 3, 1911, General Motors acquired Chevrolet in 1918. Chevrolet was positioned by Alfred Sloan to sell a lineup of mainstream vehicles to directly compete against Henry Ford's Model T in the 1920s, with "Chevrolet" or "Chevy" being at times synonymous with GM. In North America, Chevrolet sells and produces a wide variety of automobiles, from subcompact cars to medium-duty commercial trucks, whereas in Europe, the brand name is used on automobiles produced in Korea by General Motors. Since 2011, Chevrolet is GM's youngest brand in North America after GM dropped Pontiac, Saturn &amp; Hummer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Chevypnglogo.png/150px-Chevypnglogo.png
