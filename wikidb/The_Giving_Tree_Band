3.30	The_Giving_Tree_Band	The Giving Tree Band	The Giving Tree Band is an American indie folk-rock group started in 2004 by brothers Todd and Eric Fink and based in Yorkville, Illinois. Though the group uses an instrumentation largely associated with bluegrass and Americana, their sound often drums up comparisons to such classic rock icons as The Band, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and The Beatles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Gtb_hob.jpg/220px-Gtb_hob.jpg
