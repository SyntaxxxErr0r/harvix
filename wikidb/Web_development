147.3	Web_development	Web development	Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet or an intranet (a private network). This can include web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. However, among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, or social network services.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Web_development_timeline.png/800px-Web_development_timeline.png
