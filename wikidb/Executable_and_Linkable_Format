74.7	Executable_and_Linkable_Format	Executable and Linkable Format	In computing, the Executable and Linkable Format is a common standard file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. First published in the System V Application Binary Interface specification, and later in the Tool Interface Standard, it was quickly accepted among different vendors of Unix systems. In 1999 it was chosen as the standard binary file format for Unix and Unix-like systems on x86 by the 86open project.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Elf-layout--en.svg/200px-Elf-layout--en.svg.png
