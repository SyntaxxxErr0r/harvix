64.5	Electronic_voice_phenomenon	Electronic voice phenomenon	Electronic voice phenomena are electronically generated noises that resemble speech, but are supposedly not the result of intentional voice recordings or renderings. Common sources of EVP include static, stray radio transmissions, and background noise. Recordings of EVP are often created from background sound by increasing the gain (i.e. sensitivity) of the recording equipment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/White-noise.png/220px-White-noise.png
