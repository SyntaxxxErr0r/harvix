57.1	Wieliczka_Salt_Mine	Wieliczka Salt Mine	The Wieliczka Salt Mine, located in the town of Wieliczka in southern Poland, lies within the Kraków metropolitan area. The mine, built in the 13th century, produced table salt continuously until 2007, as one of the world's oldest salt mines still in operation. From its beginning and throughout its existence, the Royal mine was run by the Żupy krakowskie Salt Mines, believed to be the world's 14th-oldest company. Commercial mining was discontinued in 1996 due to low salt prices and mine flooding.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Wieliczka-saltmine-kinga.jpg/300px-Wieliczka-saltmine-kinga.jpg
