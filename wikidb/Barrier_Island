2.00	Barrier_Island	Barrier island	Barrier Islands, a coastal landform and a type of barrier system, are relatively narrow strips of sand that parallel the mainland coast. They usually occur in chains, consisting of anything from a few islands to more than a dozen. Excepting the tidal inlets that separate the islands, a barrier chain may extend uninterrupted for over a hundred kilometers, the longest and widest being Padre Island. The length and width of barriers and overall morphology of barrier coasts are related to parameters including tidal range, wave energy, sediment supply, sea-level trends and basement controls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Accreting_coast_Image6.svg/360px-Accreting_coast_Image6.svg.png
