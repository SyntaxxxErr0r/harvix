8.40	Dysfunctional_uterine_bleeding	Dysfunctional uterine bleeding	Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB) is abnormal genital tract bleeding based in the uterus and found in the absence of demonstrable structural or organic pathology. It is usually due to hormonal disturbances: reduced levels of progesterone causes low levels of pgf2 alpha and causes menorrhagia; increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) (a fibrinolytic enzyme) leads to more fibrinolysis.
