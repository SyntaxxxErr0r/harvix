Tyler's Rebellion was not only the most extreme and widespread insurrection in English history but also the best-documented popular rebellion to have occurred during medieval times. The names of some of its leaders, John Ball, Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, are still familiar in popular culture, although little is known of them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Richard_II_meets_rebels.jpg/300px-Richard_II_meets_rebels.jpg
