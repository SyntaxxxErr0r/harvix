7.30	Crosby%2C_Stills%2C_Nash_%26_Young	Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young	Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash is a folk rock supergroup made up of David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, also known as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (CSNY) when joined by occasional fourth member Neil Young. They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies (similar to Simon &amp; Garfunkel), often tumultuous interpersonal relationships, political activism, and lasting influence on music and culture. All four members of CSNY have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, though Young's multiple inductions were for work not involving the group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Csny-8-20-06.jpg/250px-Csny-8-20-06.jpg
