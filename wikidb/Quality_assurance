71.2	Quality_assurance	Quality assurance	Black-box testing is a method of software testing that tests the functionality of an application as opposed to its internal structures or workings (see white-box testing). Specific knowledge of the application's code/internal structure and programming knowledge in general is not required. The tester is only aware of what the software is supposed to do, but not how i.e. when he enters a certain input, he gets a certain output; without being aware of how the output was produced in the first place. Test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do. It uses external descriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements, and designs to derive test cases. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional. The test designer selects valid and invalid inputs and determines the correct output. There is no knowledge of the test object's internal structure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Blackbox.svg/200px-Blackbox.svg.png
