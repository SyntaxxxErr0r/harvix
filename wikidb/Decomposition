72.9	Decomposition	Decomposition	Decomposition (or rotting) is the process by which organic material is broken down into simpler forms of matter. The process is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the biome. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death. Although no two organisms decompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition. The science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as taphonomy from the Greek word taphos, meaning tomb.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Dead_rat%28poisonned%29and_naturally_mummifiedFungus.jpg/220px-Dead_rat%28poisonned%29and_naturally_mummifiedFungus.jpg
