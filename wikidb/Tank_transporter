3.00	Tank_transporter	Tank transporter	A tank transporter is a specialized road vehicle for the transport of tanks, to and from the battlefield or during peacetime. They are necessary to limit the mileage of the tracked vehicles (as the tracks have a limited lifetime) and also to reduce wear on road surfaces which can easily be damaged by such heavy vehicles. Tank transporters also use less fuel than tracked vehicles and may have a higher road speed if provided with a good road network.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Diamond_T_M20.jpg/220px-Diamond_T_M20.jpg
