8.74	Flight_dynamics_(aircraft)	Flight dynamics (fixed wing aircraft)	Flight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle's center of mass, known as pitch, roll and yaw (quite different from their use as Tait-Bryan angles).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Flight_dynamics_with_text.png/325px-Flight_dynamics_with_text.png
