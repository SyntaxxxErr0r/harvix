65.3	Drag_queen	Drag queen	A drag queen is a man who dresses, and usually acts, like a caricature woman often for the purpose of entertaining. There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly, from professionals who have starred in films to people who just try it once. Drag queens also vary by class and culture and can vary even within the same city. Although many drag queens are gay men, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who do drag for various reasons or purposes. Women who dress like men for the same purpose are known as drag kings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/2004-GayPrideBrazil-1.jpeg/180px-2004-GayPrideBrazil-1.jpeg
