63.1	Small_world_experiment	Small world experiment	The small world experiment comprised several experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram and other researchers examining the average path length for social networks of people in the United States. The research was groundbreaking in that it suggested that human society is a small world type network characterized by short path lengths. The experiments are often associated with the phrase "six degrees of separation", although Milgram did not use this term himself.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Six_degrees_of_separation.svg/220px-Six_degrees_of_separation.svg.png
