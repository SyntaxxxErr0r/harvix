2.10	Responsible_Government	Responsible government	Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability which is the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament (and if bicameral, primarily to the lower house, which is more numerous, directly elected, and thus more representative than the upper house) rather than to the monarch, or, in the colonial context, to the imperial government.
