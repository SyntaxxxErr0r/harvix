Amazon Kindle eReaders enable users to shop for, download, browse, and read e-books, newspapers, magazines, blogs, and other digital media via wireless networking. The hardware platform, developed by Amazon.com subsidiary Lab126, began as a single device and now comprises a range of devices â€” most using an E Ink electronic paper display capable of rendering 16 shades of gray to simulate reading on paper while minimizing power consumption.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Amazon_Kindle_logo.svg/220px-Amazon_Kindle_logo.svg.png
