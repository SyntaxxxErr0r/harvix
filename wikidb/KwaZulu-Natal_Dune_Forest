1.00	KwaZulu-Natal_Dune_Forest	KwaZulu-Natal Dune Forest	KwaZulu-Natal Dune Forest is a subtropical forest type that was once found almost continuously along the coastal dunes of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This vegetation type develops in sheltered areas behind the littoral zone, where with some protection from the salt wind it may develop with canopies as tall as 30 m. It still exists in protected areas, but much has been degraded by human activity. Coastal dune forest covers approximately 1% of the land area of KwaZulu-Natal, and is a habitat type seriously threatened from human population pressure and development.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Dune_Forest.JPG/220px-Dune_Forest.JPG
