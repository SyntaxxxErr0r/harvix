196.1	Colony_collapse_disorder	Colony collapse disorder	Colony collapse disorder is a phenomenon in which worker bees from a beehive or European honey bee colony abruptly disappear. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of apiculture, the term colony collapse disorder was first applied to a drastic rise in the number of disappearances of Western honey bee colonies in North America in late 2006. Colony collapse is significant because many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Honeybee-cooling_cropped.jpg/250px-Honeybee-cooling_cropped.jpg
