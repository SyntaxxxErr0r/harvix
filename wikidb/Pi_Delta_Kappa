That same year, at the University of Cincinnati, Professor Howell Lindley and an unnamed female professor chartered the Gamma chapter. Lindley assisted his chapter with the petition to Chi Omega.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/University_of_Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_c._1904.jpg/130px-University_of_Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_c._1904.jpg
