80.1	Gluten	Gluten	Gluten (from Latin gluten, "glue") is a protein composite found in foods processed from wheat and related grain species, including barley and rye. It gives elasticity to dough, helping it to rise and to keep its shape, and often giving the final product a chewy texture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Gluten_Sources.png/290px-Gluten_Sources.png
