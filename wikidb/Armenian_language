61.6	Armenian_language	Armenian language	The Armenian language ( in TAO or in RAO, Armenian pronunciation: â€”) is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenian people. It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia as well as in the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The language is also widely spoken by Armenian communities in the Armenian diaspora. It has its own script, the Armenian alphabet, and is of interest to linguists for its distinctive phonological developments within Indo-European.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Armenian_language_in_the_Armenian_alphabet.svg/200px-Armenian_language_in_the_Armenian_alphabet.svg.png
