55.8	Page_view	Page view	A page view (PV) or page impression is a request to load a single HTML file ('page') of an Internet site. On the World Wide Web a 'page' request would result from a web surfer clicking on a link on another 'page' pointing to the 'page' in question. This should be contrasted with a "hit", which refers to a request for any file from a web server. There may therefore be many hits per 'page' view since an HTML 'page' can be made up of multiple files.
