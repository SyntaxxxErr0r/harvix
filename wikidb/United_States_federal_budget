Congressional decisions are governed by rules and legislation regarding the federal budget process. Budget committees set spending limits for the House and Senate committees and for Appropriations subcommittees, which then approve individual appropriations bills to allocate funding to various federal programs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/US_Federal_Outlay_and_GDP_linear_graph.png/200px-US_Federal_Outlay_and_GDP_linear_graph.png
