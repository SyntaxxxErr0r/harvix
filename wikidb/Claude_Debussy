110.5	Claude_Debussy	Claude Debussy	Claude-Achille Debussy (22 August 1862 â€“ 25 March 1918) was a French composer. Along with Maurice Ravel, he was one of the most prominent figures working within the field of impressionist music, though he himself intensely disliked the term when applied to his compositions. In France, he was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1903. A crucial figure in the transition to the modern era in Western music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Claude_Debussy_ca_1908%2C_foto_av_F%C3%A9lix_Nadar.jpg/220px-Claude_Debussy_ca_1908%2C_foto_av_F%C3%A9lix_Nadar.jpg
