It lies on the slope of Mount Hor in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah (Wadi Araba), the large valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Al_Khazneh.jpg/250px-Al_Khazneh.jpg
