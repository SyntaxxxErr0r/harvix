1.00	Sarcophagus_(Nuclear_Reactor)	New Safe Confinement	The New Safe Confinement (NSC or New Shelter) is the structure intended to contain the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, Ukraine, part of which was destroyed by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The idea is to prevent the reactor wreck from leaking radioactive material into the environment. Originally planned to be in place by 2005, as of 2011 the confinement is expected to be completed in 2015.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/New_Safe_Confinement.jpg/250px-New_Safe_Confinement.jpg
