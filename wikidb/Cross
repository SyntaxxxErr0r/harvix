78.5	Cross	Cross	A cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two lines or bars perpendicular to each other, dividing one or two of the lines in half. The lines usually run vertically and horizontally; if they run obliquely, the design is technically termed a saltire, although the arms of a saltire need not meet at right angles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Cross2.svg/150px-Cross2.svg.png
