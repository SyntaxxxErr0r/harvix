41.66	Shalwar_kameez	Shalwar kameez	Shalwar kameez—alternatively salwar kameez or shalwar qameez—is a traditional dress worn by both women and men in South Asia and Central Asia. Shalwar are loose pajama-like trousers. The legs are wide at the top and narrow at the ankle. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic. The side seams (known as the chaak), left open below the waist-line, give the wearer greater freedom of movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Clothing_worn_by_most_Pashtun_males.jpg/170px-Clothing_worn_by_most_Pashtun_males.jpg
