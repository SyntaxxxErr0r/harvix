144.6	Freedom_of_speech	Freedom of speech	Freedom of speech is the political right to communicate one's ideas via speech. The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously, but includes any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used. In practice, the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations, as with libel, slander, obscenity and incitement to commit a crime.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Redacted777.jpg/100px-Redacted777.jpg
