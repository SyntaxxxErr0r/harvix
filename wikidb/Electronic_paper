204.9	Electronic_paper	Electronic paper	Electronic paper, e-paper and electronic ink are display technologies which are designed to mimic the appearance of ordinary ink on paper. Unlike conventional backlit flat panel displays which emit light, electronic paper displays reflected light like ordinary paper. Many of the technologies can hold static text and images indefinitely without using electricity, while allowing images to be changed later. Flexible electronic paper uses plastic substrates and plastic electronics for the display backplane.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/E-ink.png/500px-E-ink.png
