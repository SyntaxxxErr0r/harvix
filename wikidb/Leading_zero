8.00	Leading_zero	Leading zero	A leading zero is any 0 digit that leads a number string in positional notation. For example, James Bond's famous identifier, 007, has two leading zeros. Leading zeros occupy most significant digits, which could be left blank or omitted for the same numeric value. Usual decimal notation of integers does not use leading zeros except for the zero itself, which would be denoted as an empty string otherwise.
