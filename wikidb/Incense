63.2	Incense	Incense	Incense (from Latin incendere "to burn") is composed of aromatic biotic materials, which release fragrant smoke when burned. The term incense refers to the substance itself, rather than to the odor that it produces. It is used in religious ceremonies, ritual purification, aromatherapy, meditation, for creating a spiritual atmosphere, and for masking unpleasant odors. The use of incense may have originated in Ancient Egypt, where the (oleo) gum resins of aromatic trees were imported from the Arabian and Somali coasts to be used in religious ceremonies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Incenselonghua.jpg/220px-Incenselonghua.jpg
