2.00	Intropin	Dopamine	Dopamine, a simple organic chemical in the catecholamine family, plays a number of important physiological roles in the bodies of animals. Its name derives from its chemical structure, which consists of an amine group (NH2) linked to a catechol structure called dihydroxyphenylalanine (acronym DOPA). In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitterâ€”a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells. The human brain uses five known types of dopamine receptors, labeled D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. Dopamine is produced in several areas of the brain, including the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Dopamine2.svg/200px-Dopamine2.svg.png
