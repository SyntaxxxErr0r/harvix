12.30	Wusun	Wusun	The Wūsūn (Chinese: ; literally "Grandchildren of The Crow") were a nomadic steppe people who, according to the Chinese histories, originally lived in western Gansu in northwest China near the Yuezhi people. After being defeated by the Xiongnu (circa 176 BCE) they fled to the region of the Ili river and (lake) Issyk Kul where they remained for at least five centuries and formed a powerful force.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Wu-sun_Lage.png/300px-Wu-sun_Lage.png
