6.10	Bowling_Green_Falcons	Bowling Green Falcons	The Bowling Green Falcons are the intercollegiate athletic teams of Bowling Green State University, located in Bowling Green, Ohio. The Falcons participate in NCAA Division I in the Mid-American Conference and the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. BGSU is one of only 13 universities in the nation that plays Division I FBS football and Division I ice hockey. The Falcons have won three consecutive conference championships in women's basketball in 2005, 2006, and 2007. The women's soccer team captured the conference crown. The Falcons' main rivals are the Toledo Rockets; separated by just 20 miles (32 km) of Interstate 75 in northwestern Ohio, the two schools celebrate a heated rivalry in several sports. The best known of these games is the annual football game, known as the Battle of I-75. The winner now takes home a bronzed I-75 road sign. The winner used to take home the Peace Pipe, a Native American peace pipe placed upon a wood tablet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/97/Bowling_Green_Falcons.svg/100px-Bowling_Green_Falcons.svg.png
