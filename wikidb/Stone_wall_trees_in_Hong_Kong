2.00	Stone_wall_trees_in_Hong_Kong	Stone wall trees in Hong Kong	Masonry wall trees refer to trees grown from openings in masonry stone retaining walls. In alleviating harzards from landslides, many slopes adjacent to main roads and developments on Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong needed to be secured. Between the 19th century and World War II, the Hong Kong Government and other contractors constructed masonry stone walls to prevent these hazards. Not until the last two decades have slopes been stabilised through cementing. In early constructed walls, opened joints between stones allowed strong species like banyans to sprout. Traffic and human activities carry on notwithstanding the growth of these plants, which further stabilise the retaining walls they are growing on. As time goes by, sprouts mature into fully developed stone wall trees.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/HK_Kennedy_Town_Forbes_Street_w1.jpg/200px-HK_Kennedy_Town_Forbes_Street_w1.jpg
