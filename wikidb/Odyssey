248.2	Odyssey	Odyssey	The Odyssey is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. It is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, the other work ascribed to Homer. The poem is fundamental to the modern Western canon, and is the second—the Iliad being the first—extant work of Western literature. It was probably composed near the end of the 8th century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the Greek coastal region of Anatolia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Beginning_Odyssey.svg/300px-Beginning_Odyssey.svg.png
