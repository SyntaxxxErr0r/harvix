78.8	Beryllium	Beryllium	Beryllium ( -ee-É™m) is the chemical element with the symbol Be and atomic number 4. Because any beryllium synthesized in stars is short-lived, it is a relatively rare element in both the universe and in the crust of the Earth. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Be-140g.jpg/150px-Be-140g.jpg
