55.6	Carrageenan	Carrageenan	Carrageenans are large, highly flexible molecules that curl forming helical structures. This gives them the ability to form a variety of different gels at room temperature. They are widely used in the food and other industries as thickening and stabilizing agents. A particular advantage is that they are pseudoplasticâ€”they thin under shear stress and recover their viscosity once the stress is removed. This means that they are easy to pump but stiffen again afterwards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Moleculare_structure_of_different_carrageenan_types.svg/310px-Moleculare_structure_of_different_carrageenan_types.svg.png
