58.7	Aliasing	Aliasing	In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing refers to an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled. It also refers to the distortion or artifact that results when the signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Moire_pattern_of_bricks.jpg/205px-Moire_pattern_of_bricks.jpg
