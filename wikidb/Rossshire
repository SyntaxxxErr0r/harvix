3.00	Rossshire	Ross-shire	Ross-shire is an area in the Highland Council Area in Scotland. The name is now used as a geographic or cultural term, equivalent to Ross. Until 1889 the term denoted a county of Scotland, also known as the County of Ross. The county bordered on Sutherland, Cromartyshire (of which it contained many exclaves), Inverness-shire and an exclave of Nairnshire. It included most of Ross as well as Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. Dingwall was the traditional county town.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/RossshireTraditional.png/230px-RossshireTraditional.png
