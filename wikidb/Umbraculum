10.20	Umbraculum	Umbraculum	The Umbraculum (Italian: Ombrellino, "little umbrella") is a historic piece of the papal regalia and insignia, once used on a daily basis to provide shade for the pope (Galbreath, 27). Also known as the pavilion, in modern usage the umbraculum is a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church and the authority of a pope over it. It is found in the contemporary Church at all the basilicas throughout the world, placed prominently at the right of their main altars. Whenever a pope visits a basilica, its umbraculum is opened.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Ombrellino-keys.svg/220px-Ombrellino-keys.svg.png
