4.40	Sweet'N_Low	Sweet'n Low	Sweet'n Low (trademarked as Sweet'N Low) is a brand of artificial sweetener from granulated saccharin, dextrose and cream of tartar. Saccharin was first discovered in 1878 by Constantin Fahlberg, a chemist working on coal tar derivatives at the Johns Hopkins University. Although saccharin was commercialized not long after its discovery, it was not until decades later that its use became widespread. Sweet'n Low was first introduced in 1957 by Benjamin Eisenstadt and his son, Marvin Eisenstadt. The elder Eisenstadt had earlier invented the sugar packet, but neglected to patent it, and artificial sweetener packets were an outgrowth of that business. The two were the first to market and distribute the sugar substitute in powdered form. Their distribution company, Cumberland Packing Corporation, still controls the product. The name "Sweet'n Low" itself derives from an 1863 song by Sir Joseph Barnby, which took both its title and lyrics from an Alfred Lord Tennyson poem, entitled "The Princess: Sweet and Low". In Canada, Sweet 'n Low is made from Sodium Cyclamate because Saccharin has not been allowed as a food additive since the 1970s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/Sweet_n_Low.svg/176px-Sweet_n_Low.svg.png
