57.0	Non-Euclidean_geometry	Non-Euclidean geometry	Non-Euclidean geometry is either of two specific geometries that are, loosely speaking, obtained by negating the Euclidean parallel postulate, namely hyperbolic and elliptic geometry. This is one term which, for historical reasons, has a meaning in mathematics which is much narrower than it appears to have in the general English language. There are a great many geometries which are not Euclidean geometry, but only these two are referred to as the non-Euclidean geometries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Noneuclid.svg/400px-Noneuclid.svg.png
