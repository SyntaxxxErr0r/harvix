94.4	Writing	Writing	Writing is the representation of language in a textual medium through the use of a set of signs or symbols (known as a writing system). It is distinguished from illustration, such as cave drawing and painting, and non-symbolic preservation of language via non-textual media, such as magnetic tape audio.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Stipula_fountain_pen.jpg/220px-Stipula_fountain_pen.jpg
