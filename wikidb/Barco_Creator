It was developed by the Creative Systems (later Graphics) division of the Barco Group from 1988 (first shown as a prototype at Ipex 88) to the late 1990s, and ran on several generations of Silicon Graphics computers. Barco (later Esko) ColorTone for Windows NT is considered its successor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bf/Barco_creator_workstation.png
