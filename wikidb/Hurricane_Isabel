58.4	Hurricane_Isabel	Hurricane Isabel	Hurricane Isabel was the costliest and deadliest hurricane in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Isabel formed near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave on September 6 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (265 km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Hurricane_Isabel_14_sept_2003_1445Z.jpg/220px-Hurricane_Isabel_14_sept_2003_1445Z.jpg
