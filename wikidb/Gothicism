2.00	Gothicism	Gothicismus	Gothicismus, Gothism, or Gothicism (Swedish: ) is the name given to what is considered to have been a cultural movement in Sweden, centered around the belief in the glory of the Swedish ancestors, originally considered to be the Geats, which were identified with the Goths. The founders of the movement were Nicolaus Ragvaldi, the brothers Johannes and Olaus Magnus. The belief continued to hold power in the 17th century, when Sweden was a great power following the Thirty Years' War, but lost most of its sway in the 18th. It was revitalized by national romanticism in the early 19th century, this time with the vikings as heroic figures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Carta_Marina_Ex_Scandia.jpg/220px-Carta_Marina_Ex_Scandia.jpg
