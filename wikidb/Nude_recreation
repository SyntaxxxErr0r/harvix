Such activities can take place in private spaces, such as in a person's own property or in a naturist context, but also in public areas. Activities in which people engage in the nude include hiking, running (in some contexts this is referred to as streaking), swimming, cycling and yoga. More passive activities include sauna, hot springs, and sunbathing, such as at a nude beach.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Nacktreiten.JPG/200px-Nacktreiten.JPG
