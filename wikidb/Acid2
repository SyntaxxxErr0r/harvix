94.0	Acid2	Acid2	Acid2 is a test page published and promoted by the Web Standards Project to expose web page rendering flaws in web browsers and other applications that render HTML. Named after the acid test for gold, it was developed in the spirit of Acid1, a relatively narrow test of compliance with the Cascading Style Sheets 1.0 (CSS1) standard, and was released on April 13, 2005. As with Acid1, an application passes the test if the way it displays the test page matches a reference image.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Acid2_reference.png
