It was triggered by a vote of the National Convention to execute Maximilien Robespierre, Antoine Louis LÃ©on de Saint-Just de Richebourg and several other leading members of the Terror. This ended the most radical phase of the French Revolution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Shot.jpg/220px-Shot.jpg
