Originally titled Rocket Number Nine, the album had acquired its present name, and the red-on-white sleeve by Claude Dangerfield, by 1969. The album is known particularly for the two songs featuring space chants - Interplanetary Music and Rocket Number Nine Take off for the Planet Venus - that would stay in the Arkestra's repertoire for many years;	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/InterstellarLowWaysRa.jpg/220px-InterstellarLowWaysRa.jpg
