The shell of this species lacks a callus, leaving the umbilicus exposed, in which the inner coils of the shell are visible. This opening constitutes approximately 15% of the shell diameter at its widest point.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Nautilus_macromphalus_2b.jpg/200px-Nautilus_macromphalus_2b.jpg
