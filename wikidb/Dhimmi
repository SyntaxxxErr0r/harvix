94.6	Dhimmi	Dhimmi	A , (collectively /, "the people of the dhimma") is a non-Muslim subject of a Muslim state. Linguistically, the word means "one whose responsibility has been taken". This has to be understood in the context of the definition of state in Islam. Dhimma allows rights of residence in return for taxes. According to scholars, Dhimmis have the same social responsibilities and rights as Muslims. They are excused or excluded from specific duties assigned to Muslims, and otherwise equal under the laws of property, contract and obligation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Allah-eser-green.png/180px-Allah-eser-green.png
