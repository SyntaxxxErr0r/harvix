Their life cycle alternates between an actively swimming trophozoite and an infective, resistant cyst. The genus was named after French zoologist Alfred Mathieu Giard.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Giardia_lamblia_SEM_8698_lores.jpg/200px-Giardia_lamblia_SEM_8698_lores.jpg
