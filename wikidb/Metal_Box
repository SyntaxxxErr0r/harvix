12.82	Metal_Box	Metal Box	Metal Box is the second album by Public Image Ltd, released in 1979 by Virgin Records. The album showed a radical departure from PIL's relatively conventional debut First Issue, released in 1978, with the band moving into a more avant-garde sound, characterised by singer John Lydon's cryptic vocals, Jah Wobble's propulsive dub reggae-inspired basslines, and a unique, "metallic" guitar sound, made from guitarist Keith Levene playing Veleno guitars which are made entirely of aluminium. Metal Box is widely regarded as a landmark of post-punk and experimental rock. In 2003, the album was ranked number 469 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/PIL_-_Metal_Box_original.jpg/220px-PIL_-_Metal_Box_original.jpg
