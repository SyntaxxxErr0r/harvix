63.1	Arthur's_Seat,_Edinburgh	Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh	Arthur's Seat is the main peak of the group of hills which form most of Holyrood Park, described by Robert Louis Stevenson as "a hill for magnitude, a mountain in virtue of its bold design". It is situated in the centre of the city of Edinburgh, about a mile to the east of Edinburgh Castle. The hill rises above the city to a height of 250.5 m (822 ft), provides excellent panoramic views of the city, is relatively easy to climb, and is popular for hillwalking. Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest and simplest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above Dunsapie Loch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Bb-arthursseatedinburgh.jpg/280px-Bb-arthursseatedinburgh.jpg
