12.64	Trade_surplus	Balance of trade	The balance of trade (or net exports, sometimes symbolized as NX) is the difference between the monetary value of exports and imports of output in an economy over a certain period. It is the relationship between a nation's imports and exports. A positive balance is known as a trade surplus if it consists of exporting more than is imported; a negative balance is referred to as a trade deficit or, informally, a trade gap. The balance of trade is sometimes divided into a goods and a services balance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Cumulative_Current_Account_Balance.png/400px-Cumulative_Current_Account_Balance.png
