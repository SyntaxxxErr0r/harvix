3.00	Tom_Swift_IV	Tom Swift IV	Tom Swift IV is the unofficial name of this series of juvenile science fiction adventure novels, the fourth to feature a protagonist named Tom Swift. Unlike the previous series, it was not created by the Stratemeyer Syndicate, but was created by Byron Preiss Visual Productions for Simon &amp; Schuster, who had bought out the Syndicate and obtained the rights of some of the Syndicate's series. However, all gave the author as Victor Appleton, as with the previous series.
