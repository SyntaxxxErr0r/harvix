3.10	I'm_Sorry_I'll_Read_That_Again	I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again	I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again (often abbreviated ISIRTA) was a BBC radio comedy programme which originated from the Cambridge University Footlights revue Cambridge Circus. It had a devoted youth following, with live recordings being more akin to a rock concert than a comedy show â€“ a tradition which continued right through to the days of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue.
