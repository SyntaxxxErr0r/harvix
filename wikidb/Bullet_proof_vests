3.00	Bullet_proof_vests	Ballistic vest	A ballistic vest, bulletproof vest or bullet-resistant vest is an item of personal armor that helps absorb the impact from firearm-fired projectiles and shrapnel from explosions, and is worn on the torso. Soft vests are made from many layers of woven or laminated fibers and can be capable of protecting the wearer from small-caliber handgun and shotgun projectiles, and small fragments from explosives such as hand grenades.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/Army_IOTV.jpg
