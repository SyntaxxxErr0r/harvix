74.0	Peripheral_Component_Interconnect	Conventional PCI	Conventional PCI is a computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer. These devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself, called a planar device in the PCI specification, or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of ISA plus one VESA Local Bus as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. PCI is being replaced by PCI-X and PCI Express, but as of 2011 , most motherboards are still made with one or more PCI slots, which are sufficient for many uses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/PCI_Slots_Digon3.JPG/200px-PCI_Slots_Digon3.JPG
