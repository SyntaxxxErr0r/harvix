133.3	Clothing	Clothing	Clothing is a term that refers to a covering for the human body that is worn. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic and is a feature of nearly all human societies. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Clothes.jpg/220px-Clothes.jpg
