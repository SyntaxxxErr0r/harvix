134.6	Guglielmo_Marconi	Guglielmo Marconi	Guglielmo Marconi (Italian pronunciation: ; 25 April 1874 â€“ 20 July 1937) was an Italian inventor, known as the father of long distance radio transmission and for his development of Marconi's law and a radio telegraph system. Marconi is often credited as the inventor of radio, and indeed he shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun "in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy". Much of Marconi's work in radio transmission was built upon previous experimentation and the commercial exploitation of ideas by others such as Hertz, Maxwell, Faraday, Popov, Lodge, Fessenden, Stone, Bose, and Tesla. As an entrepreneur, businessman, and founder of the The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company in 1897, Marconi was more successful than any other because of his ability to commercialize radio and its associated equipment. In 1924, he was ennobled as Marchese Marconi.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Guglielmo_Marconi.jpg/220px-Guglielmo_Marconi.jpg
