1.00	Fresnel_mirror	Ridged mirror	In atomic physics, a ridged mirror (or ridged atomic mirror, or Fresnel diffraction mirror) is a kind of atomic mirror, designed for the specular reflection of neutral particles coming at the grazing incidence angle, characterised in the following: in order to reduce the mean attraction of particles to the surface and increase the reflectivity, this surface has narrow ridges.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Image-Ridged_Mirror_figureB.png/400px-Image-Ridged_Mirror_figureB.png
