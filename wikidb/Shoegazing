80.1	Shoegazing	Shoegazing	Shoegazing (also known as shoegaze) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged from the United Kingdom in the late 1980s. It lasted there until the mid 1990s, with a critical zenith reached in 1990 and 1991. The British music press—particularly NME and Melody Maker—named this style shoegazing because the musicians in these bands stood relatively still during live performances in a detached, introspective, non-confrontational state, hence the idea that they were gazing at their shoes. The heavy use of effects pedals also contributed to the image of performers looking down at their feet during concerts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/My_Bloody_Valentine-2.jpg/220px-My_Bloody_Valentine-2.jpg
