18.30	Biblioteca_Ambrosiana	Biblioteca Ambrosiana	The Biblioteca Ambrosiana is a historic library in Milan, Italy, also housing the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, the Ambrosian art gallery. Named after Ambrose, the patron saint of Milan, it was founded by Cardinal Federico Borromeo (1564â€“1631), whose agents scoured Western Europe and even Greece and Syria for books and manuscripts. Some major acquisitions of complete libraries were the manuscripts of the Benedictine monastery of Bobbio (1606) and the library of the Paduan Vincenzo Pinelli, whose more than 800 manuscripts filled 70 cases when they were sent to Milan and included the famous Iliad, the Ilia Picta.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Biblioteca_Ambrosiana_2010.jpg/300px-Biblioteca_Ambrosiana_2010.jpg
