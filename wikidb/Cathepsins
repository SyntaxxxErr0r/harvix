2.00	Cathepsins	Cathepsin	Cathepsins are proteases: proteins that break apart other proteins, found in many types of cells including those in all animals. There are approximately a dozen members of this family, which are distinguished by their structure, catalytic mechanism, and which proteins they cleave. Most of the members become activated at the low pH found in lysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within those organelles. There are, however, exceptions such as cathepsin K, which works extracellularly after secretion by osteoclasts in bone resorption.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Cathepsin_K_1TU6.png/220px-Cathepsin_K_1TU6.png
