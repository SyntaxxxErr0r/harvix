56.0	Hurricane_Floyd	Hurricane Floyd	Hurricane Floyd was a very powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane which struck the east coast of the United States. It was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Floyd triggered the third largest evacuation in US history (behind Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Rita, respectively) when 2.6 million coastal residents of five states were ordered from their homes as it approached. The Cape Verde-type hurricane formed off the coast of Africa and lasted from September 7 to September 19, peaking in strength as a very strong Category 4 hurricane—just short of the highest possible rating on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. It was among the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its strength ever recorded.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Hurricane_Floyd_14_sept_1999_2030Z.jpg/220px-Hurricane_Floyd_14_sept_1999_2030Z.jpg
