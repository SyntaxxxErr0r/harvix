77.1	Drifting_(motorsport)	Drifting (motorsport)	Drifting refers to a driving technique and to a motorsport where the driver intentionally oversteers, causing loss of traction in the rear wheels, while maintaining control from entry to exit of a corner. A car is drifting when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle, to such an extent that the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Drifting1.JPG/300px-Drifting1.JPG
