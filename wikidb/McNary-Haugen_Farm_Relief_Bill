2.00	McNary-Haugen_Farm_Relief_Bill	McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill	The McNary-Haugen Farm Relief Act, which never became law, was a highly controversial plan in the 1920s to subsidize American agriculture by raising the domestic prices of farm products. The plan was for the government to buy the wheat, and either store it or export it at a loss. It was co-authored by Charles L. McNary (R-Oregon) and Gilbert N. Haugen (R-Iowa). Despite attempts in 1924, 1926, 1927, and 1928 to pass the bill — it was vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, and never approved. It was supported by then-Secretary of Agriculture Henry C. Wallace.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/McNary-Haugen_1929.jpg/300px-McNary-Haugen_1929.jpg
