99.0	Anarcho-syndicalism	Anarcho-syndicalism	Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism which focuses on the labour movement. The word syndicalism comes from the French word syndicat which means trade union , from the Latin word syndicus which in turn comes from the Greek word σύνδικος (syndikos) which means caretaker of an issue. Syndicalism is an alternative co-operative economic system. Adherents view it as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically self-managed by workers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Anarchy-symbol.svg/125px-Anarchy-symbol.svg.png
