56.9	Muggle	Muggle	Muggle, a term from the Harry Potter book series by J. K. Rowling, refers to a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born into the magical world. Muggles also do not have any magical blood. It differs from the term Squib, which refers to a person with one or more magical parents yet without any magical ability, and from the term Muggle-born (or the more offensive mudblood), which refers to a person with magical abilities but without magical parents. Other words also spelled "muggle" have been in use over the years, but often they are unrelated to the term used in the Harry Potter series.
