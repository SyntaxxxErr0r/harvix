78.7	Herbie_Hancock	Herbie Hancock	Herbert Jeffrey "Herbie" Hancock (b. April 12, 1940) is an American pianist, keyboardist, bandleader and composer. As part of Miles Davis's "second great quintet," Hancock helped to redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section and was one of the primary architects of the "post-bop" sound. He was one of the first jazz musicians to embrace music synthesizers and funk music (characterized by syncopated drum beats). Hancock's music is often melodic and accessible; he has had many songs "cross over" and achieved success among pop audiences. His music embraces elements of funk and soul while adopting freer stylistic elements from jazz. In his jazz improvisation, he possesses a unique creative blend of jazz, blues, and modern classical music, with harmonic stylings much like the styles of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Herbie_Hancock_2010_by_Guillaume_Laurent.jpg/300px-Herbie_Hancock_2010_by_Guillaume_Laurent.jpg
