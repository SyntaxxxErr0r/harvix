85.6	Power_factor	Power factor	The power factor of an AC electric power system is defined as the ratio of the real power flowing to the load to the apparent power in the circuit, and is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1. Real power is the capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time. Apparent power is the product of the current and voltage of the circuit. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power will be greater than the real power.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Power_factor_1.svg/300px-Power_factor_1.svg.png
