1.00	Half-way_house	Halfway house	A halfway house, also called a recovery house or sober house, is a place to allow people to begin the process of reintegration with society, while still providing monitoring and support; this is generally believed to reduce the risk of recidivism or relapse when compared to a release directly into society. Some halfway houses are meant solely for reintegration of persons who have been recently released from prison or jail, others are meant for people with chronic mental health disorders, and most others are for people with substance abuse issues. These sober halfway houses are many times voluntary places of residence and many of the residents may have no criminal record whatsoever. There is often opposition from neighborhoods where halfway houses attempt to locate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/TurmanHalfwayHouseAustin.JPG/220px-TurmanHalfwayHouseAustin.JPG
