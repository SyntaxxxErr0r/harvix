7.02	Reality_shows	Reality television	Reality television is a genre of television programming that presents purportedly unscripted dramatic or humorous situations, documents actual events, and usually features ordinary people instead of professional actors, sometimes in a contest or other situation where a prize is awarded. The genre, which has existed in some form or another since the early years of television programming, exploded as a phenomenon around 1999â€“2000 with the success of such television series such as Big Brother and Survivor. Programmes in the reality television genre are commonly called reality shows and often are produced in a television series. Documentaries, television news and sports television are usually not classified as reality shows.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Kim_Kardashian_3.JPG/160px-Kim_Kardashian_3.JPG
