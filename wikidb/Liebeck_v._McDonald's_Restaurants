126.2	Liebeck_v._McDonald's_Restaurants	Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants	Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants, also known as the McDonald's coffee case and the hot coffee lawsuit, is a 1994 product liability lawsuit that became a flashpoint in the debate in the U.S. over tort reform after a jury awarded $160,000 to cover medical expenses and compensatory damages (in addition to $2.7 million in punitive damages) to Liebeck who suffered 3rd degree burns in her pelvic region when she spilled hot coffee purchased from fast food restaurant McDonald's. The trial judge reduced the final verdict, and the parties settled for a confidential amount before an appeal was decided. The case was noted by some as an example of frivolous litigation; ABC News called the case "the poster child of excessive lawsuits", while others stated that the claim was "a meaningful and worthy lawsuit".
