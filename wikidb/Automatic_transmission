77.7	Automatic_transmission	Automatic transmission	An automatic transmission (also called automatic gearbox) is one type of motor vehicle transmission that can automatically change gear ratios as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Most automatic transmissions have a defined set of gear ranges, often with a parking pawl feature that locks the output shaft of the transmission.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/Automatic_transmission_cut.jpg/220px-Automatic_transmission_cut.jpg
