4.11	Fort_Colville	Fort Colville	The trade center Fort Colville (also Fort Colvile) was built by the Hudson's Bay Company at Kettle Falls on the Columbia River, a few miles west of the present site of Colville, Washington in 1825, to replace Spokane House as a regional trading center, as the latter was deemed to be too far from the Columbia River. Named for Andrew Colville, a London governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, it was part of the Columbia fur district of the HBC, and was an important stop on the York Factory Express trade route to London via Hudson Bay. Fort Colville was considered second in importance only to Fort Vancouver, near the mouth of the Columbia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/PaulKane-BushCamp-ROM.jpg/250px-PaulKane-BushCamp-ROM.jpg
