91.5	Air_conditioning	Air conditioning	The concept of air conditioning is known to have been applied in Ancient Rome, where aqueduct water was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them down. Other techniques in medieval Persia involved the use of cisterns and wind towers to cool buildings during the hot season. Modern air conditioning emerged from advances in chemistry during the 19th century, and the first large-scale electrical air conditioning was invented and used in 1902 by Willis Haviland Carrier.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Gorriemuseumapalachicola_ice_mchn1.jpg/170px-Gorriemuseumapalachicola_ice_mchn1.jpg
