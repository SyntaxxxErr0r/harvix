1.00	Court_House	Courthouse	A courthouse (sometimes spelled court house) is a building that is home to a local court of law and often the regional county government as well, although this is not the case in some larger cities. The term is common in North America. In most other English speaking countries, buildings which house courts of law are simply called "courts" or "court buildings". In most of Continental Europe and former non-English speaking European colonies, the equivalent term is a palace of justice, Palais de Justice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Bulloch_county_courthouse_statesboro_georgia_2005.jpg/260px-Bulloch_county_courthouse_statesboro_georgia_2005.jpg
