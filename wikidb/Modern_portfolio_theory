119.7	Modern_portfolio_theory	Modern portfolio theory	Modern portfolio theory is a theory of finance which attempts to maximize portfolio expected return for a given amount of portfolio risk, or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of expected return, by carefully choosing the proportions of various assets. Although MPT is widely used in practice in the financial industry and several of its creators won a Nobel memorial prize for the theory, in recent years the basic assumptions of MPT have been widely challenged by fields such as behavioral economics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e1/Markowitz_frontier.jpg
