1.00	The_Oak_and_the_Calf	The Oak and the Calf	The Oak and the Calf, subtitled Sketches of Literary Life in the Soviet Union, is a memoir by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn about his attempts to have his work published in his own country. The book was begun in April 1967 when Solzhenitsyn was 49 years old, but supplements were added by the author in 1971, 1973, and 1974. The book was first published in Russian in 1975 under the title Бодался теленок с дубом (lit. "A Calf was Head-butting an Oak tree", which has a distinctly humorous ring in Russian). It has been translated into English by Harry Willetts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/The_Oak_and_the_Calf.jpg/220px-The_Oak_and_the_Calf.jpg
