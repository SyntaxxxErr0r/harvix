56.0	Spaghetti_Western	Spaghetti western	The first entirely Italian western movie was Il terrore dell'Oklahoma (1959), directed by Mario Amendola. The best-known and perhaps archetypal Spaghetti westerns were directed by Sergio Leone and scored by Ennio Morricone: the "Dollars Trilogy" (A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)) and Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). These are consistently found on top of or among the best rated Westerns in general.
