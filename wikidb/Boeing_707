54.6	Boeing_707	Boeing 707	The Boeing 707 is a mid-size, narrow-body four-engine jet airliner that was manufactured by Boeing from 1958 to 1979. Its name is most commonly pronounced as "Seven Oh Seven". Versions of the aircraft have a capacity from 140 to 202 passengers and a range of 3,680 to 3,735 nautical miles (6,820 to 6,917 km). Developed as Boeing's first jet airliner, the 707 features a swept-wing design with podded engines. Dominating passenger air transport in the 1960s, and remaining common throughout the 1970s, the 707 is generally credited with ushering in the Jet Age. Although it was not the first jetliner in service, the 707 was the first to be commercially successful. It established Boeing as one of the largest manufacturers of passenger aircraft, and led to the later series of aircraft with "7x7" designations. The subsequent 727, 737, and 757 also share elements of the 707's fuselage design.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Boeing_707-138B_Qantas_Jett_Clipper_Ella_N707JT.jpg/300px-Boeing_707-138B_Qantas_Jett_Clipper_Ella_N707JT.jpg
