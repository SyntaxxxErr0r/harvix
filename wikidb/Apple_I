118.1	Apple_I	Apple I	The original Apple Computer, also known retroactively as the Apple I, or Apple-1, is a personal computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976. They were designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only means of transportation, a VW van and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500 . It was demonstrated in April 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Apple_I_Computer.jpg/250px-Apple_I_Computer.jpg
