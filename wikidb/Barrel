54.3	Barrel	Barrel	A barrel or cask is a hollow cylindrical container, traditionally made of vertical wooden staves and bound by wooden or metal hoops. Traditionally, the barrel was a standard size of measure referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity. For example, a beer barrel had originally a capacity of 36 US gallons (140 L) while an ale barrel a capacity of 32 US gallons (120 L). Wine was shipped in barrels of 31.5 US gallons (119 L). A small barrel is called a keg.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Oak-wine-barrel-at-toneleria-nacional-chile.jpg/250px-Oak-wine-barrel-at-toneleria-nacional-chile.jpg
