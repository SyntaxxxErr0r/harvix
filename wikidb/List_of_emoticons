53.5	List_of_emoticons	List of emoticons	This is a list of notable and commonly used emoticons or textual portrayals of a writer's mood or facial expression in the form of icons. The Western use of emoticons is quite different from Eastern usage, and Internet forums, such as 2channel, typically, show expressions in their own ways. In recent times, graphic representations, both static and animated, have taken the place of traditional emoticons in the form of icons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Binette-typo.png/100px-Binette-typo.png
