He was accused of scouting the Metrorail station in Arlington County, Virginia and recording video of the station on 4 different occasions. In July he handed over the footage to an individual who he believed to be an operative of Al-Qaeda. According to the indictment he told undercover agents that an attack would cause most casualties between 4 pm and 5 pm and suggested placing the bombs in rolling suitcases. The plan of attack began as early as April 18, 2010, according to officials. He told undercover agents that he would be ready to conduct jihad against America in January 2011 after completing Hajj in November 2010. At the time of his arrest it did not appear that Ahmed had received any militant training overseas from Al-Qaeda or its associates. He told operatives that he was willing to martyr himself and had taught himself martial arts, use of firearms and knife and gun tactics, skills he offered to teach others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Arlington_Cemetery_Metro.jpg/250px-Arlington_Cemetery_Metro.jpg
