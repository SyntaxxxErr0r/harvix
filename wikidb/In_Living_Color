56.0	In_Living_Color	In Living Color	In Living Color is an American sketch comedy television series, which originally ran on the Fox Network from April 15, 1990 to May 19, 1994. Brothers Keenen and Damon Wayans created, wrote, and starred in the program. The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television. The show was taped before a live studio audience at stage 7 at the Fox Television Center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. The title of the series was inspired by the NBC announcement of broadcasts being presented "in living color" during the 1950s and 1960s, prior to mainstream color television. It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast was African-American, unlike other sketch comedy shows like Saturday Night Live whose casts are usually mostly white.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/InLivingColorlogo.jpg
