77.1	Lupercalia	Lupercalia	Lupercalia was a very ancient, possibly pre-Roman pastoral festival, observed on February 13 through 15 to avert evil spirits and purify the city, releasing health and fertility. Lupercalia subsumed Februa, an earlier-origin spring cleansing ritual held on the same date, which gives the month of February its name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Euander-Pallene.jpg/225px-Euander-Pallene.jpg
