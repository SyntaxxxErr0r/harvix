1.20	Ashmont_(MBTA_station)	Ashmont (MBTA station)	Ashmont is located on the Red Line in Dorchester, Massachusetts. It opened on September 1, 1928, and is the subway terminal for the Red Line's Dorchester Branch. Ashmont is also the terminus of the light rail Ashmontâ€“Mattapan High Speed Line, which loops around on an elevated viaduct. Towards the end of the Ashmont renovations, new signs were put in that now read ASHMONT/PEABODY SQ., but this change will not appear on any new maps or publications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Ashmont_renovated.JPG/300px-Ashmont_renovated.JPG
