170.6	Dengue_fever	Dengue fever	Dengue fever , also known as breakbone fever, is an infectious tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash that is similar to measles. In a small proportion of cases the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Denguerash.JPG/230px-Denguerash.JPG
