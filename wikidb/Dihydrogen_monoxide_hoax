75.6	Dihydrogen_monoxide_hoax	Dihydrogen monoxide hoax	In the dihydrogen monoxide hoax, water is called by an unfamiliar name, "dihydrogen monoxide", followed by a listing of real negative effects of this chemical, in an attempt to convince people that it should be carefully regulated, labeled as hazardous, or banned. The hoax is designed to illustrate how the lack of scientific literacy and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears. "Dihydrogen monoxide", shortened to "DHMO", is a name for water that is consistent with basic rules of chemical nomenclature, but is not among the names published by IUPAC and is almost never used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Water_molecule_%281%29.svg/220px-Water_molecule_%281%29.svg.png
