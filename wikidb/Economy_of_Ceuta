1.00	Economy_of_Ceuta	Economy of Spain	The economy of Spain is the twelfth-largest economy in the world, based on nominal GDP comparisons, and the fifth-largest in Europe. It is regarded as the world's 20th most developed country. Until 2008 the economy of Spain had been regarded as one of the most dynamic within the EU, attracting significant amounts of foreign investment. Spain's economy had been credited with having avoided the virtual zero growth rate of some of its largest partners in the EU. In fact, the country's economy had created more than half of all the new jobs in the European Union over the five years ending 2005. Between 2008 and 2012 this process was rapidly reversed, characterized by the fact that almost a quarter of Spain's workforce is currently unemployed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Madrid_sky_line.jpg/250px-Madrid_sky_line.jpg
