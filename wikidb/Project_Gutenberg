88.2	Project_Gutenberg	Project Gutenberg	Project Gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to "encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks". Founded in 1971 by Michael S. Hart, it is the oldest digital library. Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of public domain books. The project tries to make these as free as possible, in long-lasting, open formats that can be used on almost any computer. As of November 2011 , Project Gutenberg claimed over 38,000 items in its collection.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Project_Gutenberg_logo.png
