6.10	Electric_Funeral	Electric Funeral	"Electric Funeral" is the fifth song from Black Sabbath's second album Paranoid, released in 1970. The song deals with nuclear war and its aftermath. While thematically similar to "War Pigs", the song lyrics are even darker, describing a nightmarish post-apocalyptic wasteland of irradiated, sub-human mutants living in a miserable, synthetic garden in constant and utter terror of nuclear fallout; a fact complemented by an eerie main riff. The song did not appear in the live set until 1977, and then was not played again until the Reunion Tour.
