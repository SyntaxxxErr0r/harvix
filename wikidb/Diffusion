60.7	Diffusion	Diffusion	Diffusion describes the spread of particles through random motion from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. The time dependence of the statistical distribution in space is given by the diffusion equation. The concept of diffusion is tied to that of mass transfer driven by a concentration gradient. Diffusion is invoked in the social sciences to describe the spread of ideas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Diffusion.svg/220px-Diffusion.svg.png
