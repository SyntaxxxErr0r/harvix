1.00	MV_Dubai_Moon	MV Dubai Moon	MV Dubai Moon was a cargo ship which sank on (or soon after) May 21, 2010 due to strong waves caused by a tropical storm. The ship was carrying vehicles in the Gulf of Aden when she was struck by Cyclone Bandu, which pushed it off the track. The ship sent a distress call which was picked by Royal Navy frigate HMS Chatham. 23 crew members were rescued by the Westland Lynx helicopter from Chatham before Dubai Moon sank.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/10/Mvdubaimoon_sinking.jpg/320px-Mvdubaimoon_sinking.jpg
