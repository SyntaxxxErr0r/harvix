62.9	The_Forever_War	The Forever War	The Forever War (1974) is a science fiction novel by American author Joe Haldeman, telling the contemplative story of soldiers fighting an interstellar war between humanity and the enigmatic Tauran species. Its exploration of the inhumanity of war and of bureaucracy, and of the psychological effects resulting from the time dilation of space travel (a soldier returns home after centuries away), won the Nebula Award in 1975, and the Hugo and the Locus awards in 1976. Moreover, Forever Free (1999) and Forever Peace (1997) are, respectively, direct and thematic sequel novels. The novella A Separate War (1999) is another sequel of sorts, occurring simultaneously to the latter portion of The Forever War. Informally, the novels compose The Forever War series; the novel also inspired a comic book and a board game.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/TheForeverWar%281stEd%29.jpg/200px-TheForeverWar%281stEd%29.jpg
