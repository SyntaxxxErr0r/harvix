88.8	Sulfur_dioxide	Sulfur dioxide	Sulfur dioxide (also sulphur dioxide) is the chemical compound with the formula . It is a poisonous gas with a pungent, irritating smell, that is released by volcanoes and in various industrial processes. Since coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, their combustion generates sulfur dioxide unless the sulfur compounds are removed before burning the fuel. Further oxidation of SO2, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO2, forms H2SO4, and thus acid rain. Sulfur dioxide emissions are also a precursor to particulates in the atmosphere. Both of these impacts are cause for concern over the environmental impact of these fuels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Sulfur-dioxide-2D.svg/160px-Sulfur-dioxide-2D.svg.png
