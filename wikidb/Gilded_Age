77.7	Gilded_Age	Gilded Age	In United States history, the Gilded Age refers to the era of rapid economic and population growth in the United States during the postâ€“Civil War and post-Reconstruction eras of the late 19th century. The term "Gilded Age" was coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in their book The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today. The name refers to the process of gilding an object with a superficial layer of gold and is meant to make fun of ostentatious display while playing on the term "golden age."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/The_Breakers_Newport.jpg/300px-The_Breakers_Newport.jpg
