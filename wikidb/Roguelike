167.6	Roguelike	Roguelike	The roguelike is a sub-genre of role-playing video games, characterized by level randomization, permanent death, and turn-based movement. Most roguelikes feature ASCII graphics, with newer ones increasingly offering tile-based graphics. Games are typically dungeon crawls, with many monsters, items, and environmental features. Computer roguelikes usually employ the majority of the keyboard to facilitate interaction with items and the environment. The name of the genre comes from the 1980 game Rogue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Role-playing_video_game_icon.svg/100px-Role-playing_video_game_icon.svg.png
