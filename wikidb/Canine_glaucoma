4.10	Canine_glaucoma	Canine glaucoma	Glaucoma in dogs refers to a group of diseases that affect the optic nerve and involves a loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern. Raised intraocular pressure is a significant risk factor for developing glaucoma (above 22 mmHg or 2.9 kPa). Untreated glaucoma in dogs leads to permanent damage of the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss, which can progress to blindness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Human_eye_cross-sectional_view_grayscale.png/220px-Human_eye_cross-sectional_view_grayscale.png
