51.2	Chicago_'L'	Chicago 'L'	The 'L' is the rapid transit system serving the city of Chicago and some of its surrounding suburbs. It is operated by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). It is the second longest rapid transit system in total track mileage in the United States, after the New York City Subway, and is the third busiest rail mass transit system in the United States, after New York City and Washington, DC's Metro. Chicago's 'L' is one of four heavy-rail systems in the United States (the 'L', New York City Subway, PATH and the PATCO Speedline) that provides 24-hour service on at least some portions of their systems. The oldest sections of the 'L' started operating in 1892, making it the second-oldest rapid transit system in the Americas, after New York City . The 'L' has been credited with helping create the densely built-up city core that is one of Chicago's distinguishing features. The 'L' consists of eight rapid transit lines laid out in a spoke-hub distribution paradigm mainly focusing transit towards the Loop. Although the 'L' gained its nickname because large parts of the system are elevated, portions of the network are in a subway, at grade level, or open cut.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/CTA_train_NE_corner.jpg/275px-CTA_train_NE_corner.jpg
