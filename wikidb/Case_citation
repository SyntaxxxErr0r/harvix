97.1	Case_citation	Case citation	Case citation is the system used in many countries to identify the decisions in past court cases, either in special series of books called reporters or law reports, or in a 'neutral' form which will identify a decision wherever it was reported. Although case citations are formatted differently in different jurisdictions, they generally contain the same key information.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Unitedstatesreports.jpg/250px-Unitedstatesreports.jpg
