116.6	Kopi_Luwak	Kopi Luwak	Kopi luwak , or civet coffee, is one of the world's most expensive and low-production varieties of coffee. It is made from the beans of coffee berries which have been eaten by the Asian Palm Civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) and other related civets, then passed through its digestive tract. A civet eats the berries for their fleshy pulp. In its stomach, proteolytic enzymes seep into the beans, making shorter peptides and more free amino acids. Passing through a civet's intestines the beans are then defecated, keeping their shape. After gathering, thorough washing, sun drying, light roasting and brewing, these beans yield an aromatic coffee with much less bitterness. This coffee was widely noted as the most expensive coffee in the world with prices reaching $160 per pound. Since then Uchunari grade 0 coffee has been introduced on the international coffee market.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Indonesian_farmer_shows_coffee_beans_already_digested_by_Asian_Palm_Civet%2C_but_before_cleaning_and_roasting.jpg/200px-Indonesian_farmer_shows_coffee_beans_already_digested_by_Asian_Palm_Civet%2C_but_before_cleaning_and_roasting.jpg
