103.2	Dementia	Dementia	Dementia (taken from Latin, originally meaning "madness", from de- "without" + ment, the root of mens "mind") is a serious loss of global cognitive ability in a previously unimpaired person, beyond what might be expected from normal aging. It may be static, the result of a unique global brain injury, or progressive, resulting in long-term decline due to damage or disease in the body. Although dementia is far more common in the geriatric population, it can occur before the age of 65, in which case it is termed "early onset dementia". A recent survey done by Harvard University School of Public Health and the Alzheimer's Europe consortium revealed that the second leading health concern (after cancer) among adults is Dementia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Alzheimer_and_other_dementias_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2002.svg/220px-Alzheimer_and_other_dementias_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2002.svg.png
