114.1	Calligraphy	Calligraphy	Calligraphy (from Greek kallos "beauty" + grapháº½ "writing") is a type of visual art. It is often called the art of fancy lettering (Mediavilla 1996: 17). A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner" (Mediavilla 1996: 18). The story of writing is one of aesthetic evolution framed within the technical skills, transmission speed(s) and material limitations of a person, time and place (Diringer 1968: 441). A style of writing is described as a script, hand or alphabet (Fraser and Kwiatkowski 2006; Johnston 1909: Plate 6).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Ijazah3.jpg/220px-Ijazah3.jpg
