1.10	Solar_eclipse_of_August_31,_1970	Solar eclipse of August 31, 1970	An annular solar eclipse occurred on August 31, 1970. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partially obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun, causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring), blocking most of the Sun's light. An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region thousands of kilometres wide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9b/SE1970Aug31A.png/320px-SE1970Aug31A.png
