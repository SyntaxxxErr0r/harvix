10.13	Integer_partition	Partition (number theory)	In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered to be the same partition; if order matters then the sum becomes a composition. For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Ferrer_partitioning_diagrams.svg/300px-Ferrer_partitioning_diagrams.svg.png
