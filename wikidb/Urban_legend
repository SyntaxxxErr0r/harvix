138.7	Urban_legend	Urban legend	An urban legend, urban myth, urban tale, or contemporary legend, is a form of modern folklore consisting of stories that may or may not have been believed by their tellers to be true. As with all folklore and mythology, the designation suggests nothing about the story's veracity, but merely that it is in circulation, exhibits variation over time, and carries some significance that motivates the community in preserving and propagating it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Bunnyman_bridge_night.jpg/250px-Bunnyman_bridge_night.jpg
