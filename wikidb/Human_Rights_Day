52.7	Human_Rights_Day	Human Rights Day	The 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights occurred on 10 December 2008, and the UN Secretary-General launched a year-long campaign leading up to this anniversary. Because the UDHR holds the world record as the most translated document (with more than 360 language versions available), organizations around the globe used the year to focus on helping people everywhere learn about their rights.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Stamp_of_Moldova_292.gif/220px-Stamp_of_Moldova_292.gif
