8.00	Barbara_Gaskin	Barbara Gaskin	Barbara Gaskin is a British singer (born 1950 in Hatfield, Hertfordshire) who, with her musical partner, the keyboardist Dave Stewart, formed a duo in 1981. In September of that year they had a number one single in the UK with a cover version of the song "It's My Party". Subsequent singles "Busy Doing Nothing" (1983), and "The Locomotion" (1986) also entered the UK Singles Chart, without reaching the heights of their debut release. Five albums followed, released on the duo's own Broken Records label. Gaskin and Stewart continue to work together and occasionally play live concerts with Andy Reynolds on guitar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Spirogyra3.jpg/220px-Spirogyra3.jpg
