4.00	Ramshorn_snail	Ramshorn snail	The term ramshorn snail is used in two different ways. In the aquarium trade it is used to describe various kinds of freshwater snails whose shells are planispiral, meaning that the shell is a flat coil. Such shells resemble a coil of rope, or (as the name suggests) a ram's horn. In a more general natural history context, the term "ramshorn snails" is used more precisely to mean those aquatic pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Planorbidae that have planispiral coiled shells.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/RamshornSnail.jpg/220px-RamshornSnail.jpg
