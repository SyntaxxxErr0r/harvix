23.41	Telephone_slamming	Telephone slamming	Telephone slamming is an illegal telecommunications practice, in which a subscriber's telephone service is changed without their consent. Slamming became a more visible issue after the deregulation of the telecommunications industry in the mid-1980s, especially after several brutal price wars between the major telecommunications companies. The term slamming was coined by Mick Ahearn who was a consumer marketing manager at AT&amp;T in September 1987. The inspiration for the term came from the ease at which a competitor could switch a customer's service away from AT&amp;T by falsely notifying a telephone company that an AT&amp;T customer had elected to switch to their service. This process gave AT&amp;T's competitors a "slam dunk" method for the unauthorized switching of a customer's long distance service. The term slamming became an industry standard term for this practice.
