21.33	Economy_of_Syria	Economy of Syria	The economy of Syria is based on a diversified economy that revolves around agriculture, oil, industry and tourism. Its GDP per capita expanded 80% in the 1960s reaching a peak of 336% of total growth during the 1970s. This proved unsustainable and the economy shrank by 33% during the 1980s. However the GDP per capita registered a very modest total growth of 12% (1,1% per year on average) during the 1990s due to successful diversification. More recently, the IMF projected real GDP growth at 3.9% in 2009 from close to 6% in 2008. The two main pillars of the Syrian economy used to be agriculture and oil, which together accounted for about one-half of GDP. Agriculture, for instance, accounted for about 25% of GDP and employed 25% of the total labor force. However, poor climatic conditions and severe drought badly affected the agricultural sector, thus reducing its share in the economy to about 17% of 2008 GDP, down from 20.4% in 2007, according to preliminary data from the Central Bureau of Statistics. On the other hand, higher crude oil prices countered declining oil production and led to higher budgetary and export receipts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Philipnote.jpg/300px-Philipnote.jpg
