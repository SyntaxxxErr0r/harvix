57.5	Sexual_abuse	Sexual abuse	Sexual abuse, also referred to as molestation, is the forcing of undesired sexual behavior by one person upon another. When that force is immediate, of short duration, or infrequent, it is called sexual assault. The offender is referred to as a sexual abuser or (often pejoratively) molester. The term also covers any behavior by any adult towards a child to stimulate either the adult or child sexually. When the victim is younger than the age of consent, it is referred to as child sexual abuse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Martin_Van_Maele_-_La_Grande_Danse_macabre_des_vifs_-_08.jpg/180px-Martin_Van_Maele_-_La_Grande_Danse_macabre_des_vifs_-_08.jpg
