60.4	Algonquin_Round_Table	Algonquin Round Table	The Algonquin Round Table was a celebrated group of New York City writers, critics, actors and wits. Gathering initially as part of a practical joke, members of "The Vicious Circle", as they dubbed themselves, met for lunch each day at the Algonquin Hotel from 1919 until roughly 1929. At these luncheons they engaged in wisecracks, wordplay and witticisms that, through the newspaper columns of Round Table members, were disseminated across the country.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Algonquin_Round_Table.gif/250px-Algonquin_Round_Table.gif
