97.4	John_of_England	John, King of England	John (24 December 1166 â€“ 18/19 October 1216), also known as John Lackland (French: Jean Sansterre), was King of England from 6 April 1199 until his death. During John's reign, England lost the duchy of Normandy to King Philip II of France, which resulted in the collapse of most of the Angevin Empire and contributed to the subsequent growth in power of the Capetian dynasty during the 13th century. The baronial revolt at the end of John's reign led to the signing of the Magna Carta, a document often considered to be an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Angevin_empire.svg/300px-Angevin_empire.svg.png
