136.2	Saturday_Night_Live	Saturday Night Live	Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title of NBC's Saturday Night. The show revolves around a series of sketches parodying American culture and politics, performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Among these sketches is the Weekend Update, news show featuring satirical views of current news stories, which has been performed on every episode of the show. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity who delivers an opening monologue and often takes part in sketches with the cast, and features a musical guest who also performs. SNL normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!", beginning the show proper.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/Saturday_Night_Live_Title_Card.jpeg
