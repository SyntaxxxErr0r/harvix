64.5	John_Hancock	John Hancock	John Hancock (January 23, 1737 â€“ October 8, 1793) was a merchant, statesman, and prominent Patriot of the American Revolution. He served as president of the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence, so much so that the term "John Hancock" has become, in the United States, a synonym for signature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/John_Hancock_1770-crop.jpg/220px-John_Hancock_1770-crop.jpg
