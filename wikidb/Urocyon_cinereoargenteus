1.40	Urocyon_cinereoargenteus	Gray fox	The gray fox is a mammal of the order Carnivora ranging throughout most of the southern half of North America from southern Canada to the northern part of South America (Venezuela and Colombia). This species and the closely related Channel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis) are the only living members of the genus Urocyon, which is considered to be among the most primitive of the living canids. Though it was once the most common fox in the east, and still is found there, human advancement allowed the red fox to become more dominant. The Pacific States still have the gray fox as a dominant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Urocyon_cinereoargenteus.jpg/220px-Urocyon_cinereoargenteus.jpg
