89.6	Quantum_cryptography	Quantum cryptography	Arguably the best-known application of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution (QKD). (For the history of the field see the history section in quantum key distribution). QKD describes the process of using quantum communication to establish a shared key between two parties (usually called Alice and Bob) without a third party (Eve) learning anything about that key, even if Eve can eavesdrop on all communication between Alice and Bob. This is achieved (roughly speaking) by letting Alice encode the bits of the key as quantum data before sending them to Bob; if Eve tries to learn these bits, the messages will be disturbed and Alice and Bob will notice.
