52.3	Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States	Freedom of speech in the United States	Freedom of speech in the United States is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and by many state constitutions and state and federal laws. The freedom is not absolute; the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized several categories of speech that are excluded from the freedom of speech, and it has recognized that governments may enact reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions on speech.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Newseum_5_Freedoms_1st_Amendment.jpg/220px-Newseum_5_Freedoms_1st_Amendment.jpg
