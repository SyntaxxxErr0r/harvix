2.00	Pituitary_adenylate_cyclase-activating_polypeptide	Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide	Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide also known as PACAP is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ADCYAP1 gene. PACAP is similar to vasoactive intestinal peptide. One of its effects is to stimulate enterochromaffin-like cells. It binds to vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Protein_ADCYAP1_PDB_2d2p.png/250px-Protein_ADCYAP1_PDB_2d2p.png
