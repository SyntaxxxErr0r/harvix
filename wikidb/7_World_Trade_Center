58.5	7_World_Trade_Center	7 World Trade Center	7 World Trade Center is a building in New York City located across from the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan. It is the second building to bear that name and address in that location. The original structure was completed in 1987 and was destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The current 7 World Trade Center opened in 2006 on part of the site of the old 7 World Trade Center. Both buildings were developed by Larry Silverstein, who holds a ground lease for the site from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/7_World_Trade_Center.jpg/220px-7_World_Trade_Center.jpg
