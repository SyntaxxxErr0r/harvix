1.00	Catecholamine_reuptake_inhibitor	Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor	A norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor is a drug that acts as a reuptake inhibitor(inhibitor) for the neurotransmitters (chemical nerve in the brain) norepinephrine and dopamine by blocking the action of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT), respectively. This in turn leads to increased extracellular concentrations of both norepinephrine and dopamine and, therefore, an increase in adrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Norepinephrine_structure.png/220px-Norepinephrine_structure.png
