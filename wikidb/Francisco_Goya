120.3	Francisco_Goya	Francisco Goya	Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes (Spanish pronunciation: ; 30 March 1746–16 April 1828) was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker regarded both as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns. Goya was a court painter to the Spanish Crown, and through his works was both a commentator on and chronicler of his era. The subversive and imaginative element in his art, as well as his bold handling of paint, provided a model for the work of later generations of artists, notably Manet, Picasso and Francis Bacon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Vicente_L%C3%B3pez_Porta%C3%B1a_-_el_pintor_Francisco_de_Goya.jpg/220px-Vicente_L%C3%B3pez_Porta%C3%B1a_-_el_pintor_Francisco_de_Goya.jpg
