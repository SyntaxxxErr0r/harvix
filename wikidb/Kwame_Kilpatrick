60.7	Kwame_Kilpatrick	Kwame Kilpatrick	Kwame Malik Kilpatrick (born June 8, 1970) is a former mayor of Detroit, Michigan. Kilpatrick's mayorship was plagued by numerous scandals and rampant accusations of corruption, with the mayor eventually resigning after being charged with ten felony counts, including perjury and obstruction of justice. Kilpatrick was sentenced to four months in jail after pleading guilty to reduced charges, but with good time awarded to county jail inmates in Michigan, he was released on probation after serving 99 days. On May 25, 2010, he was sentenced to 18 months to 5 years in prison for violating his probation, and served time at the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan. He is also under a 38-charge felony indictment on additional corruption charges, in what a federal prosecutor called a "pattern of extortion, bribery and fraud" by some of Detroit's most prominent officials.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Kwame_Kilpatrick.jpg/220px-Kwame_Kilpatrick.jpg
