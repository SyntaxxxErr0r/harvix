7.21	Port_of_Ashdod	Port of Ashdod	The Port of Ashdod is one of Israel's two main cargo ports. The port is located in Ashdod, about 40 kilometers south of Tel Aviv, adjoining the mouth of the Lachish River. Its establishment significantly enhanced the country's port capacity. It is a major point of entry for both cargo and tourists in and out of Israel, as well as imported military equipment. Ships carrying humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip also unload their cargo at the port.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Ashdod_picargo.jpg/200px-Ashdod_picargo.jpg
