3.00	Vastu_shastra	Vastu shastra	Vastu shastra (, also vastu veda and vastuvidya, "science of construction", "architecture") is an ancient doctrine which consists of precepts born out of a traditional and archaic ï»¿view on how the laws of nature affect human dwellings. The designs are based on directional alignments. It is primarily applied in Hindu architecture, especially for Hindu temples, although it covers other domains, including vehicles, vessels, furnture, sculpture, etc. The foundation of Vastu is traditionally ascribed to the mythical sage Mamuni Mayan (Mahaa-muni Maya, a daanava/demon reformed by tapasyaa/austerities) in South and Vishvakarman in North India.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Vastu_purushan_in_Vastu_Sasthra.jpg/200px-Vastu_purushan_in_Vastu_Sasthra.jpg
