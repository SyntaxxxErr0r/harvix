89.2	Capacitor	Capacitor	A capacitor (originally known as condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store energy in an electric field. The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors separated by a dielectric (insulator); for example, one common construction consists of metal foils separated by a thin layer of insulating film. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Photo-SMDcapacitors.jpg/250px-Photo-SMDcapacitors.jpg
