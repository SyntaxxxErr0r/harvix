62.2	Sunglasses	Sunglasses	Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarised or darkened. In the early 20th century they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/B%26W_girl_portrait_with_sunglasses.jpg/250px-B%26W_girl_portrait_with_sunglasses.jpg
