62.3	Bauxite	Bauxite	Bauxite is an aluminium ore and is the main source of aluminium. This form of rock consists mostly of the minerals gibbsite Al(OH)3, boehmite γ-AlO(OH), and diaspore α-AlO(OH), in a mixture with the two iron oxides goethite and hematite, the clay mineral kaolinite, and small amounts of anatase TiO2. Bauxite was named after the village Les Baux in southern France, where it was first recognised as containing aluminium and named by the French geologist Pierre Berthier in 1821.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/BauxiteUSGOV.jpg/220px-BauxiteUSGOV.jpg
