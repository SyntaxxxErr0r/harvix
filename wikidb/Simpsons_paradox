10.80	Simpsons_paradox	Simpson's paradox	In probability and statistics, Simpson's paradox (or the Yuleâ€“Simpson effect) is a paradox in which a correlation present in different groups is reversed when the groups are combined. This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics, and is particularly confounding when frequency data are unduly given causal interpretations. Simpson's Paradox disappears when causal relations are brought into consideration (see Implications to decision making).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Simpson%27s_paradox_continuous.svg/220px-Simpson%27s_paradox_continuous.svg.png
