80.4	Osmosis	Osmosis	Net movement of solvent is from the less concentrated to the more concentrated (hypertonic) solution, which tends to reduce the difference in concentrations. This effect can be countered by increasing the pressure of the hypertonic solution, with respect to the hypotonic. The osmotic pressure is defined to be the pressure required to maintain an equilibrium, with no net movement of solvent. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the osmotic pressure depends on the molar concentration of the solute but not on its identity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Osmosis_computer_simulation.jpg/220px-Osmosis_computer_simulation.jpg
