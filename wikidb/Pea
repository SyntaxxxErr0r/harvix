73.2	Pea	Pea	A pea is most commonly the small spherical seed or the seed-pod of the pod fruit Pisum sativum. Each pod contains several peas. Peapods are botanically a fruit, since they contain seeds developed from the ovary of a (pea) flower. However, peas are considered to be a vegetable in cooking. The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea , the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds from several species of Lathyrus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Peas_in_pods_-_Studio.jpg/220px-Peas_in_pods_-_Studio.jpg
