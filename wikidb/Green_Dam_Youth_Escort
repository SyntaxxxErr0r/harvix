72.7	Green_Dam_Youth_Escort	Green Dam Youth Escort	Green Dam Youth Escort is content-control software for Windows developed in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Originally under a directive from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) to take effect on 1 July 2009, it was to be mandatory to have either the software pre-installed, or have the setup files on an accompanying compact disc, for all new personal computers sold in mainland China, including those imported from abroad. Subsequently, this was changed to be voluntary. End-users, however, are not under a mandate to run the software.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ce/Green_Dam_Youth_Escort_logo.png/250px-Green_Dam_Youth_Escort_logo.png
