6.23	Ribbon_eel	Ribbon eel	The ribbon eel, Rhinomuraena quaesita, or Bernis eel, is a species of saltwater eel, the only member of the genus Rhinomuraena of the Muraenidae family of order Anguilliformes. What is now known as Rhinomuraena quaesita also includes the former Rhinomuraena amboinensis. R. quaesita was used for blue ribbon eels and R. amboinensis for black ribbon eels, but these are now recognized as the same species. The ribbon eel is native to the Indian and Pacific oceans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Ribbon_eel.jpg/220px-Ribbon_eel.jpg
