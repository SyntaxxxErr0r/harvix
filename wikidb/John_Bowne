7.03	John_Bowne	John Bowne	In 1662 Bowne was arrested on orders of Governor Stuyvesant for allowing a Quaker meeting in his house. Refusing to pay the assessed fine, or to depart from the province, he was sent to Holland for trial before the Dutch West India Company. There, he successfully exonerated himself by appealing to the guarantees of religious liberty contained in the Flushing patent of 1645 granted by Governor William Kieft. Winning the respect of his judges by his uncompromising stance, he was released, and returned triumphantly home in 1664, Governor Stuyvesant being ordered to extend tolerance to all religious sects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/John_Bowne_before_Stuyvesant.jpg/220px-John_Bowne_before_Stuyvesant.jpg
