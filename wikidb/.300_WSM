2.01	.300_WSM	.300 Winchester Short Magnum	.300 Winchester Short Magnum (also known as .300 WSM) is a thirty caliber rebated rim bottlenecked centerfire short magnum cartridge that was introduced in 2001 by Winchester. The cartridge overall length is 72.64mm, cartridge case is 53.34mm in length and the bullet diameter is .308 in (7.82mm), which is common to all U.S. .30 calibre cartridges. The principle at work in the short magnum cartridge is the advantage of fitting larger volumes of powder in closer proximity to the primer's flash hole, resulting in more uniform, consistent ignition. In field use, this round mirrors the performance of its older counterpart, the .300 Winchester Magnum, which is based on a modified .375 Holland&amp;Holland belted magnum casing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/300cal.jpg/200px-300cal.jpg
