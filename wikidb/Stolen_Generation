57.1	Stolen_Generation	Stolen Generations	The Stolen Generations (also known as Stolen children) were the children of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent who were removed from their families by the Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments. The removals occurred in the period between approximately 1869 and 1969, although in some places children were still being taken until the 1970s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/QVB135lg.jpg/300px-QVB135lg.jpg
