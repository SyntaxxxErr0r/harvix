81.2	Shebang_(Unix)	Shebang (Unix)	In computing, a shebang (also called a sha-bang, hashbang, pound-bang, hash-exclam, or hash-pling) is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and exclamation mark , when it occurs as the first two characters on the first line of a text file. In this case, the program loader in Unix-like operating systems parses the rest of the first line as an interpreter directive and invokes the program specified after the character sequence with any command line options specified as parameters. The name of the file being executed is passed as the final argument.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Poundexclam.svg/220px-Poundexclam.svg.png
