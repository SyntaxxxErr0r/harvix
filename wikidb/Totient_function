4.20	Totient_function	Euler's totient function	In number theory, Euler's totient or phi function, φ is an arithmetic function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. That is, if n is a positive integer, then φ(n) is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which gcd(n, k) = 1. The totient function is a multiplicative function, meaning that if two numbers m and n are relatively prime (to each other), then φ(mn) = φ(m)φ(n).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/EulerPhi.svg/220px-EulerPhi.svg.png
