120.6	Sleep_apnea	Sleep apnea	Sleep apnea (or sleep apnoea in British English; English pronunciation: ) is a sleep disorder characterized by abnormal pauses in breathing or instances of abnormally low breathing, during sleep. Each pause in breathing, called an apnea, can last from a few seconds to minutes, and may occur 5 to 30 times or more an hour. Similarly, each abnormally low breathing event is called a hypopnea. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or "sleep study".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Obstruction_ventilation_apn%C3%A9e_sommeil.svg/230px-Obstruction_ventilation_apn%C3%A9e_sommeil.svg.png
