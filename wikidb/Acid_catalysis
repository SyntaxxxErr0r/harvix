4.10	Acid_catalysis	Acid catalysis	In acid catalysis and base catalysis a chemical reaction is catalyzed by an acid or a base. The acid is often the proton and the base is often a hydroxyl ion. Typical reactions catalyzed by proton transfer are esterfications and aldol reactions. In these reactions the conjugate acid of the carbonyl group is a better electrophile than the neutral carbonyl group itself. Catalysis by either acid or base can occur in two different ways: specific catalysis and general catalysis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Fischer_esterification_mechanism.svg/400px-Fischer_esterification_mechanism.svg.png
