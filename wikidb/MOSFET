76.4	MOSFET	MOSFET	The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor is a transistor used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. Although the MOSFET is a four-terminal device with source (S), gate (G), drain (D), and body (B) terminals, the body (or substrate) of the MOSFET often is connected to the source terminal, making it a three-terminal device like other field-effect transistors. When two terminals are connected to each other (short-circuited) only three terminals appear in electrical diagrams. The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor in both digital and analog circuits, though the bipolar junction transistor was at one time much more common.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/MOSFET_Structure.png/220px-MOSFET_Structure.png
