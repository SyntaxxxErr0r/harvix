69.0	Bisexual	Bisexuality	Bisexuality is sexual behavior or an orientation involving physical or romantic attraction to males and females, especially with regard to men and women. It is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation, along with a heterosexual and a homosexual orientation, all a part of the heterosexualâ€“homosexual continuum. Pansexuality may or may not be subsumed under bisexuality, with some sources stating that bisexuality encompasses sexual or romantic attraction to all gender identities. People who have a distinct but not exclusive preference for one sex over the other may also identify themselves as bisexual, and people who lack sexual attraction to either sex or genders are known as asexual.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Japanesepederasty18thcentury.jpg/250px-Japanesepederasty18thcentury.jpg
