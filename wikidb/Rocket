77.7	Rocket	Rocket	A rocket is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle which obtains thrust from a rocket engine. In all rockets, the exhaust is formed entirely from propellants carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction. Rocket engines push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Soyuz_rocket_ASTP.jpg/170px-Soyuz_rocket_ASTP.jpg
