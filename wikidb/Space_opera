108.5	Space_opera	Space opera	Space opera is a subgenre of science fiction that emphasizes romantic, often melodramatic adventure, set mainly or entirely in outer space, generally involving conflict between opponents possessing advanced technologies and abilities. The term has no relation to music and it is analogous to "soap opera" (see below). Perhaps the most significant trait of space opera is that settings, characters, battles, powers, and themes tend to be very large-scale.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Planetstoriesclichecover.jpg/200px-Planetstoriesclichecover.jpg
