1.01	Abakada	Abakada alphabet	During the Pre-Hispanic Era, Old Tagalog was written using the Kawi or the Baybayin script. Dr. Jos√© Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, initially suggested to indigenize the alphabet of the Philippine languages by replacing the letters C and Q with K. Based on Rizal's indigenization proposal, the Abakada became the alphabet for the Tagalog language.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Baybayin_alpha.jpg/300px-Baybayin_alpha.jpg
