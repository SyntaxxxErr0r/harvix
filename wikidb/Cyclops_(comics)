77.7	Cyclops_(comics)	Cyclops (comics)	Cyclops is a fictional character, a superhero who is the leader of the X-Men in the Marvel Comics Universe. A mutant, Cyclops emits a powerful energy beam from his eyes (an "optic blast"). In uniform, he wears a battle visor with a single, ruby-quartz lens running eye-to-eye; the resulting one-eyed appearance is why he is codenamed "Cyclops."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e6/Cyclopsjc.jpg/212px-Cyclopsjc.jpg
