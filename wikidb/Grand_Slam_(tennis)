79.2	Grand_Slam_(tennis)	Grand Slam (tennis)	The four Major tennis tournaments, also called the Slams, are the most important tennis events of the year in terms of world tour ranking points, tradition, prize-money awarded, strength and size of player field, and public attention. They are the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Currently, both the Australian Open and the US Open are played on hard courts, while the French Open is played on clay, and Wimbledon is played on grass. The "Grand Slam" is the winning of all four Major tournaments in a single calendar year; however, it has also been used for many years now to refer to any of the major tournaments, (e.g., American tennis player Pete Sampras, who won 14 Major titles in his career, is often said to have won 14 "Grand Slams"â€”even though he did not achieve a true Grand Slam by winning all four Majors in a single year).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Tennis_Grand_Slam_Calendar.png/350px-Tennis_Grand_Slam_Calendar.png
