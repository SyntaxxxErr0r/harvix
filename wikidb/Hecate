59.6	Hecate	Hecate	Hecate or Hekate (ancient Greek Ἑκάτη, Hekátē; in Shakespeare ) is an Greco-Roman goddess of triple nature - chthonic, celestial and maritime - variously associated with crossroads, gates and other entrances, passages, light in darkness, childbirth, nurturing the young, lunar lore, the night sky, the sea, the wilderness, the restless dead, dogs, snakes, healing and poisonous plants, magic and witchcraft, as well as a more universal role as World Soul in Hellenistic times. She is attested in poetry as early as Hesiod's Theogony. An inscription from late archaic Miletus naming her as a protector of entrances is also testimony to her presence in archaic Greek religion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Hecate_Chiaramonti_Inv1922.jpg/200px-Hecate_Chiaramonti_Inv1922.jpg
