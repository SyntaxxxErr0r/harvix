146.4	RS-232	RS-232	In telecommunications, RS-232 is the traditional name for a series of standards for serial binary single-ended data and control signals connecting between a and a (Data Circuit-terminating Equipment). It is commonly used in computer serial ports. The standard defines the electrical characteristics and timing of signals, the meaning of signals, and the physical size and pin out of connectors. The current version of the standard is TIA-232-F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange, issued in 1997.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/DB25_Diagram.svg/220px-DB25_Diagram.svg.png
