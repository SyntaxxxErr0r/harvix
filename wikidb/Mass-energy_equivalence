56.6	Mass-energy_equivalence	Mass–energy equivalence	In physics, mass–energy equivalence is the concept that the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content. In this concept, mass is a property of all energy, and energy is a property of all mass, and the two properties are connected by a constant. This means (for example) that the total internal energy E of a body at rest is equal to the product of its rest mass m and a suitable conversion factor to transform from units of mass to units of energy. Albert Einstein proposed mass–energy equivalence in 1905 in one of his Annus Mirabilis papers entitled "Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy-content?" The equivalence is described by the famous equation:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Relativity3_Walk_of_Ideas_Berlin.JPG/400px-Relativity3_Walk_of_Ideas_Berlin.JPG
