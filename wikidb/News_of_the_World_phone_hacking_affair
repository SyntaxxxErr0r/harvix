52.8	News_of_the_World_phone_hacking_affair	News International phone hacking scandal	The News International phone-hacking scandal is an ongoing controversy involving the News of the World and other British tabloid newspapers published by News International, a subsidiary of News Corporation. Employees of the newspaper were accused of engaging in phone hacking, police bribery, and exercising improper influence in the pursuit of publishing stories. Investigations conducted from 2005â€“2007 concluded that the paper's phone hacking activities were limited to celebrities, politicians and members of the British Royal Family. However, in July 2011, it was revealed that the phones of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, relatives of deceased British soldiers, and victims of the 7/7 London bombings were also accessed, resulting in a public outcry against News Corporation and owner Rupert Murdoch. Advertiser boycotts contributed to the closure of the News of the World on 10 July, ending 168 years of publication.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Rupert_Murdoch_-_WEF_Davos_2007.jpg/170px-Rupert_Murdoch_-_WEF_Davos_2007.jpg
