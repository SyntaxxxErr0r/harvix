63.7	Inulin	Inulin	Inulins are a group of naturally occurring polysaccharides produced by many types of plants. They belong to a class of fibers known as fructans. Inulin is used by some plants as a means of storing energy and is typically found in roots or rhizomes. Most plants that synthesize and store inulin do not store other materials such as starch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Inulin_strukturformel.png/300px-Inulin_strukturformel.png
