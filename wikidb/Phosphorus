159.3	Phosphorus	Phosphorus	Phosphorus ( -fər-əs) is the chemical element that has the symbol P and atomic number 15. A multivalent nonmetal of the nitrogen group, phosphorus as a mineral is almost always present in its maximally oxidized state, as inorganic phosphate rocks. Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms—white phosphorus and red phosphorus—but due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/PhosphComby.jpg/250px-PhosphComby.jpg
