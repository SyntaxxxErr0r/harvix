1.00	Fremantle_Society	The Fremantle Society	The Fremantle Society is a community-based culture and heritage advocacy group in Fremantle, Western Australia. It was formed in 1972 to work to prevent what was seen as undesirable demolition and/or development of historic buildings in Fremantle. As the significance of Fremantle's built heritage came to be more widely recognised and respected (by the City, and property owners), the focus of the Fremantle Society has evolved to include more of the cultural heritage of the area.
