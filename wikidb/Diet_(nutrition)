81.1	Diet_(nutrition)	Diet (nutrition)	In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism. Dietary habits are the habitual decisions an individual or culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. With the word diet, it is often implied the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos, due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy. Proper nutrition requires the proper ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, and food energy in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in health and mortality and can also define cultures and play a role in religion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/FoodSourcesOfMagnesium.jpg/220px-FoodSourcesOfMagnesium.jpg
