Part of the summit is grassy and open and part is covered with scrub oak and shrubs; the sides of the mountain are wooded with northern hardwood tree species. Views from the top include the southern Taconic Mountains and the Hudson River Valley. Several trails traverse Alander Mountain, most notably the 15.7 mi (25.3 km) South Taconic Trail, which passes just beneath the summit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/USA_Massachusetts_location_map.svg/200px-USA_Massachusetts_location_map.svg.png
