1.00	Verendrye,_North_Dakota	Verendrye, North Dakota	Verendrye (also Falson) is a ghost town in McHenry County, North Dakota, United States. The Verendrye Electric Cooperative was established here in 1939 but relocated to Velva within a couple years. By 2007, the remnants of the town amounted to two or three house foundations and the backless facade of an old two-story schoolhouse. Most of the town site has been taken over by a grain farmer's machine sheds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e8/Verendrye_School.jpg/220px-Verendrye_School.jpg
