3.00	Community_of_St._Mary	Community of St. Mary	The Community of St. Mary (CSM) is an Anglican religious order of nuns with three independent houses located in Greenwich, New York, Sewanee, Tennessee, and Mukwonago, Wisconsin. The oldest indigenous Anglican order in the United States, it was founded in New York City in 1865 by a group of five sisters, and formally constituted by Bishop Horatio Potter of New York as the Sisters of St. Mary. The Episcopal Church was initially slow to recognize the order, and they only found wide support after four of the sisters died nursing victims of a yellow fever epidemic in Memphis, Tennessee in 1878. These four sisters are now commemorated by the Episcopal Church on September 9 as the Martyrs of Memphis or as Constance and her Companions. The community now consists of three independent provinces: Eastern, Western, and Southern.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/St_Marys_Convent_at_Sewanee_Tennessee.jpg/400px-St_Marys_Convent_at_Sewanee_Tennessee.jpg
