102.5	Shell_game	Shell game	The shell game (also known as Thimblerig, Three shells and a pea, the old army game) is portrayed as a gambling game, but in reality, when a wager for money is made, it is a confidence trick used to perpetrate fraud. In confidence trick slang, this swindle is referred to as a short-con because it is quick and easy to pull off.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Shell_game.jpg/250px-Shell_game.jpg
