2.00	Codasyl	CODASYL	In October 1969 the DBTG published its first language specifications for the network database model which became generally known as the Codasyl Data Model. This specification in fact defined several separate languages: a data definition language (DDL) to define the schema of the database, another DDL to create one or more subschemas defining application views of the database; and a data manipulation language (DML) defining verbs for embedding in the COBOL programming language to request and update data in the database. Although the work was focused on COBOL, the idea of a host-language independent database was starting to emerge, prompted by IBM's advocacy of PL/I as a COBOL replacement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/CodasylB.png/360px-CodasylB.png
