1.10	Wincobank_(hill_fort)	Wincobank (hill fort)	Wincobank (grid reference ) is an Iron Age hill fort in the district of Sheffield, England of the same name. The fort stands on the summit of a steep hill above the River Don, it is oval in shape and covers about 10,000 square metres (108,000 ft²), surrounded by a ditch that was originally 1.5–2 m deep and a bank consisting of a rubble core with stone facings held together with timbers. The bank is vitrified, indicating that it was subjected to intense heat at some time in the past—whether this was done purposely by the builders or through accident or attack is unknown. Material taken from a drainage ditch dug through the north east rampart of the fort in 1979 was radiocarbon dated to c500 BC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Sheffield_outline_map_with_UK.svg/300px-Sheffield_outline_map_with_UK.svg.png
