1.10	Washoku	Japanese cuisine	Japanese cuisine has developed over the centuries as a result of many political and social changes throughout Japan. The cuisine eventually changed with the advent of the Medieval age which ushered in a shedding of elitism with the age of shogun rule. In the early modern era significant changes occurred resulting in the introduction of non-Japanese cultures, most notably Western culture, to Japan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/NIBITASHI.jpg/175px-NIBITASHI.jpg
