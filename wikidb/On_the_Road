248.8	On_the_Road	On the Road	On the Road is a novel by American writer Jack Kerouac, written in April 1951, and published by Viking Press in 1957. It is a largely autobiographical work that was based on the spontaneous road trips of Kerouac and his friends across mid-century America. It is often considered a defining work of the postwar Beat Generation that was inspired by jazz, poetry, and drug experiences. While many of the names and details of Kerouac's experiences are changed for the novel, hundreds of references in On the Road have real-world counterparts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OnTheRoad.jpg/180px-OnTheRoad.jpg
