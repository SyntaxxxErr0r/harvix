1.20	You_Still_Want_Me	You Still Want Me	"You Still Want Me" is a single by The Kinks released in 1964. It was their second record, and (like its predecessor) failed to chart upon release. This prompted Pye Records to consider dropping the fledgling group. However, the massive success of the band's next single, "You Really Got Me", ensured their tenure with Pye would continue until 1970, when their contract expired.
