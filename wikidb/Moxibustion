54.4	Moxibustion	Moxibustion	Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy using moxa, or mugwort herb. It plays an important role in the traditional medical systems of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Tibet, and Mongolia. Suppliers usually age the mugwort and grind it up to a fluff; practitioners burn the fluff or process it further into a cigar-shaped stick. They can use it indirectly, with acupuncture needles, or burn it on the patient's skin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/A_Dose_of_Moxa.jpg/230px-A_Dose_of_Moxa.jpg
