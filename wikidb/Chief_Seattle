69.9	Chief_Seattle	Chief Seattle	Chief Seattle (an Anglicization of Si'ahl), chief, also known as Sealth, Seathle, Seathl, or See-ahth. A prominent figure among his people, he pursued a path of accommodation to white settlers, forming a personal relationship with David Swinson "Doc" Maynard. The city of Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington, was named after him. A widely publicized speech arguing in favor of ecological responsibility and respect of native Americans' land rights has been attributed to him; however there is controversy about what, if anything, he actually said.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Chief_seattle.jpg/220px-Chief_seattle.jpg
