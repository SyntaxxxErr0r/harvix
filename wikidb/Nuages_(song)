6.30	Nuages_(song)	Nuages	"Nuages" is one of the best-known compositions by Django Reinhardt. He recorded about thirteen versions of the song, which is a jazz standard and a mainstay of the gypsy swing repertoire. English and French lyrics have been added to the originally instrumental piece. The title translates in English as "Clouds"; though the English lyric adaptation is titled "It's the bluest kind of blues". Reinhardt's 1946 recording (as can be heard in the sample to the right) is in the key of G major.
