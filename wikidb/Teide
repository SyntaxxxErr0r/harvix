51.6	Teide	Teide	Mount Teide (Spanish: , IPA: , "Teide Peak") is a volcano on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Its 3,718-metre (12,198 ft)-high summit is the highest point in Spain, the highest point above sea level in the islands of the Atlantic, and it is the third highest volcano in the world measured from its base on the ocean floor, after Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea located in Hawaii. It remains active, with its most recent eruption occurring in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent on the north western Santiago rift. The United Nations Committee for Disaster Mitigation designated Teide as a Decade Volcano, because of its history of destructive eruptions and its proximity to several large towns, of which the closest are Garachico, Icod de los Vinos and Puerto de la Cruz. Teide together with its neighbour Pico Viejo and Monta√±a Blanca form the Central Volcanic Complex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Teide_a%C3%B1o_2011.jpg/280px-Teide_a%C3%B1o_2011.jpg
