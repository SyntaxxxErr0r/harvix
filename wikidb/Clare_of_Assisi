51.9	Clare_of_Assisi	Clare of Assisi	Clare of Assisi (sometimes spelled Clair, Claire, etc.) (July 16, 1194 – August 11, 1253), born Chiara Offreduccio, is an Italian saint and one of the first followers of Saint Francis of Assisi. She founded the Order of Poor Ladies, a monastic religious order for women in the Franciscan tradition, and wrote their Rule of Life—the first monastic rule known to have been written by a woman. Following her death, the order she founded was renamed in her honor as the Order of Saint Clare, commonly referred to today as the Poor Clares.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Simone_Martini_047.jpg/220px-Simone_Martini_047.jpg
