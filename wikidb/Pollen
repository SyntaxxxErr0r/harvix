67.0	Pollen	Pollen	Pollen is a fine to coarse powder containing the microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce the male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat that protects the sperm cells during the process of their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. When pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone (i.e., when pollination has occurred), it germinates and produces a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule (or female gametophyte). Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Tulip_Stamen_Tip.jpg/220px-Tulip_Stamen_Tip.jpg
