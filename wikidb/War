228.6	War	War	War is an organized, armed, and often a 'prolonged conflict' that is carried on between states, nations, or other parties typified by extreme aggression, social disruption, and usually high mortality. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of political violence. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as warfare. An absence of war, (and other violence) is usually called peace.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg/350px-Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg
