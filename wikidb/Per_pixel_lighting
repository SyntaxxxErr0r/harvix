1.00	Per_pixel_lighting	Per-pixel lighting	In computer graphics, per-pixel lighting is commonly used to refer to a set of methods for computing illumination at each rendered pixel of an image. These generally produce more realistic images than vertex lighting, which only calculates illumination at each vertex of a 3D model and then interpolates the resulting values to calculate the per-pixel color values.
