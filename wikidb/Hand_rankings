20.12	Hand_rankings	List of poker hands	In poker, players construct hands of five cards according to predetermined rules, which vary according to which variant of poker is being played. These hands are compared using a hand ranking system that is standard across all variants of poker, the player with the highest-ranking hand winning that particular deal in most variants of poker. In some variants, the lowest-ranking hand can win or tie.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Poker-Hands.svg/300px-Poker-Hands.svg.png
