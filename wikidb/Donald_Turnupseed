2.10	Donald_Turnupseed	James Dean	James Byron Dean (February 8, 1931 â€“ September 30, 1955) was an American film actor. He is a cultural icon, best embodied in the title of his most celebrated film, Rebel Without a Cause (1955), in which he starred as troubled Los Angeles teenager Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his stardom were as loner Cal Trask in East of Eden (1955), and as the surly ranch hand, Jett Rink, in Giant (1956). Dean's enduring fame and popularity rests on his performances in only these three films, all leading roles. His premature death in a car crash cemented his legendary status.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/James_Dean_-_Giant.jpg/220px-James_Dean_-_Giant.jpg
