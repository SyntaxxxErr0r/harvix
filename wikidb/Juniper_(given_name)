6.10	Juniper_(given_name)	Juniper (given name)	The given name Juniper is either in reference to the English common name for the juniper tree or berry, or in reference to a derivation of the Welsh name Guinevere. Juniper has historically been used as both a boys' name and a girls' name. Juniper has never been on the top 1000 list of given names in the United States but is an increasingly popular girls name likely due to the popularity of a wide assortment of well-known fictional works, including the cartoon series The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, the movie Benny &amp; Joon (where the Joon character was short for Juniper), and Pamela Dean's novel Juniper, Gentian and Rosemary.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_Ginevra_de%27_Benci%2C_1474-78.png/300px-Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_Ginevra_de%27_Benci%2C_1474-78.png
