69.6	Curator	Curator	A curator (from Latin: meaning "care") is a manager or overseer. Traditionally, a curator or keeper of a cultural heritage institution (e.g., gallery, museum, library or archive) is a content specialist responsible for an institution's collections and involved with the interpretation of heritage material. The object of a traditional curator's concern necessarily involves tangible objects of some sort, whether it be inter alia artwork, collectibles, historic items or scientific collections. More recently, new kinds of curators are emerging: curators of digital data objects and biocurators.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Anne_pontegnie_02.jpg/250px-Anne_pontegnie_02.jpg
