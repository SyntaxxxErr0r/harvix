1.00	Quakers_Hill_railway_station,_Sydney	Quakers Hill railway station	Quakers Hill is a station on the CityRail Richmond Line, and serves a residential community. Two sets of points at the southern end of the station allow trains to terminate on either platform. This station is currently undergoing an easy access upgrade involving the construction of a new overhead concourse. Prior to the Easy Access upgrade, the station had an overhead ticket office attached to a footbridge. This arrangement could become congested due the narrowness of the footbridge and the position of the ticket office.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Cityrailsign.svg/275px-Cityrailsign.svg.png
