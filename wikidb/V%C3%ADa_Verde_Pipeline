4.10	V%C3%ADa_Verde_Pipeline	Vía Verde project	The Vía Verde project (English: Green Way project), also known as Gasoducto del Norte (English: Northern Gas Pipeline), is a proposed pipeline to supply natural gas to northern Puerto Rico. The pipeline would run from Peñuelas, in Puerto Rico's southern coast, to electricity-generating plants in Arecibo, Cataño and San Juan, crossing the country's Cordillera Central. The project aims to supply 71% of Puerto Rico's electrical energy needs. It is a project of Governor Luis Fortuño. It is also supported by former governor of Puerto Rico, Rafael Hernández Colón. The pipeline has been called "the centerpiece of 's efforts to kick-start Puerto Rico's dormant economy."
