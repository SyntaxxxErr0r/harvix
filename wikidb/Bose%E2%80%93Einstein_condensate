55.5	Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate	Bose–Einstein condensate	A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter of a dilute gas of weakly interacting bosons confined in an external potential and cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero ( or ). Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest quantum state of the external potential, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bose_Einstein_condensate.png/250px-Bose_Einstein_condensate.png
