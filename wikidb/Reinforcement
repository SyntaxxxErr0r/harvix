114.6	Reinforcement	Reinforcement	Reinforcement is a term in operant conditioning and behavior analysis for a process of strengthening a directly measurable dimension of behaviorâ€”such as rate (e.g., pulling a lever more frequently), duration (e.g., pulling a lever for longer periods of time), magnitude (e.g., pulling a lever with greater force), or latency (e.g., pulling a lever more quickly following the onset of an environmental event)--as a function of the delivery of a "valued" stimulus (e.g. money from a slot machine) immediately or shortly after the occurrence of the behavior.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Schedule_of_reinforcement.png/275px-Schedule_of_reinforcement.png
