54.0	Cognate	Cognate	In linguistics, cognates are words that have a common etymological origin. This learned term derives from the Latin cognatus (blood relative). Cognates within the same language are called doublets. Strictly speaking, loanwords from another language are not typically considered cognates, e.g. the English word king is not considered a true cognate of Dutch koning or German KÃ¶nig.
