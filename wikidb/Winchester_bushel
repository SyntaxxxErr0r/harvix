1.00	Winchester_bushel	Bushel	A bushel is an imperial and U.S. customary unit of dry volume, equivalent in each of these systems to 4 pecks or 8 gallons. It is used for volumes of dry commodities (not liquids), most often in agriculture. It is abbreviated as bsh. or bu. In modern usage, the dry volume is usually only nominal, with bushels referring to standard weights instead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/LA2-NSRW-5-0199.jpg/220px-LA2-NSRW-5-0199.jpg
