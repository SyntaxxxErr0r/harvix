1.00	Cyclic_graph	Cycle graph	In graph theory, a cycle graph or circular graph is a graph that consists of a single cycle, or in other words, some number of vertices connected in a closed chain. The cycle graph with n vertices is called Cn. The number of vertices in Cn equals the number of edges, and every vertex has degree 2; that is, every vertex has exactly two edges incident with it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Undirected_6_cycle.svg/160px-Undirected_6_cycle.svg.png
