54.7	Durand_Line	Durand Line	The Durand Line (Pashto: ) refers to the porous international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. This poorly marked line is approximately 2,640 kilometers (1,640 mi) long. It was established after the 1893 Durand Line Agreement between a representative of colonial British India and Afghan Amir Abdur Rahman Khan for fixing the limit of their respective spheres of influence. It is named after Henry Mortimer Durand, the Foreign Secretary of British India at the time. The single-page agreement which contains seven short articles was signed by H. M. Durand and Amir Abdur Rahman Khan, agreeing not to exercise interference beyond the frontier line between Afghanistan and what was then colonial British India (now Pakistan).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Durand_Line_Border_Between_Afghanistan_And_Pakistan.jpg/220px-Durand_Line_Border_Between_Afghanistan_And_Pakistan.jpg
