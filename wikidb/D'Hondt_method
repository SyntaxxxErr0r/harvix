51.6	D'Hondt_method	D'Hondt method	The D'Hondt method (mathematically but not operationally equivalent to Jefferson's method, and Bader–Ofer method) is a highest averages method for allocating seats in party-list proportional representation. The method described is named after Belgian mathematician Victor D'Hondt, who described it in 1878. In comparison with the Sainte-Laguë method, D'Hondt slightly favours large parties and coalitions over scattered small parties. There are two forms, closed list and open list, which differ in whether each party selects the order of election of the party's candidates, or if the voter's choice can affect the order.
