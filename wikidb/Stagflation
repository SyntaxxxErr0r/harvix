102.7	Stagflation	Stagflation	In economics, stagflation is a situation in which the inflation rate is high and the economic growth rate slows down and unemployment remains steadily high. It raises a dilemma for economic policy since actions designed to lower inflation or reduce unemployment may actually worsen economic growth. The portmanteau stagflation is generally attributed to British politician Iain Macleod, who coined the phrase in his speech to Parliament in 1965.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png
