81.1	Radioactive_decay	Radioactive decay	Radioactive decay is the process by which an atomic nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting ionizing particles . There are three types of radioactive decay: alpha decay, beta decay and gamma decay. Alpha decay occurs when there are an excessive number of protons within the nucleus causing the repulsion of the like charged protons to eject an alpha particle (helium nucleus). Beta emission occurs when the neutron to proton ratio is too high causing a neutron to decay by the emission of an electron and the neutron to convert to a proton. In a similar form of beta emission, when the proton to neutron ratio is too high a proton emits a positron causing a proton to convert to a neutron. A final form of beta decay occurs when the neutron to proton ratio is too small, the nucleus captures an orbiting electron converting a proton into an electron. Finally, gamma decay occurs when the nucleus has too much energy causing it to lose the excess by emitting a gamma ray.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Alpha_Decay.svg/220px-Alpha_Decay.svg.png
