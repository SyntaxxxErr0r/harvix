57.7	Long_Depression	Long Depression	The Long Depression was a worldwide economic recession, that began in 1873 and ended around 1896. It was the most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fueled by the Second Industrial Revolution in the decade following the American Civil War. At the time, the episode was labeled the Great Depression and held that designation until the Great Depression of the 1930s. Though a period of general deflation and low growth, it did not have the severe economic retrogression of the Great Depression.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Panic_of_1873_bank_run.jpg/300px-Panic_of_1873_bank_run.jpg
