51.9	Vapor_pressure	Vapor pressure	As a general trend, vapor pressures of liquids at ambient temperatures increase with decreasing boiling points. This is illustrated in the vapor pressure chart (see right) that shows graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Vapor_Pressure_Chart.png
