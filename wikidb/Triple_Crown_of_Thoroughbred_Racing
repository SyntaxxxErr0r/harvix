51.3	Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing	Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing	The Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (although sometimes shortened to Triple Crown, the full name is used to avoid possible confusion with other sports) consists of three races for three-year-old Thoroughbred horses. Winning all three of these Thoroughbred horse races is considered the greatest accomplishment of a Thoroughbred racehorse. The term originated in mid-19th century England. However, different nations where thoroughbred racing is popular each have their own Triple Crown series. In recent years, winning a Triple Crown has become a very rare achievement, with most horses specializing on a limited range of distances.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Ormonde.jpg/300px-Ormonde.jpg
