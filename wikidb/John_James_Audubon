94.6	John_James_Audubon	John James Audubon	John James Audubon (April 26, 1785 – January 27, 1851) was a French-American ornithologist, naturalist, and painter. He was notable for his expansive studies to document all types of American birds and for his detailed illustrations that depicted the birds in their natural habitats. His major work, a color-plate book entitled The Birds of North America (1827–1839), is considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. Audubon identified 25 new species and a number of new sub-species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/John_James_Audubon_1826.jpg/200px-John_James_Audubon_1826.jpg
