63.1	Lizzie_Borden	Lizzie Borden	Lizzie Andrew Borden (July 19, 1860 – June 1, 1927) was a woman in New England who was tried for killing her father and stepmother with a hatchet on August 4, 1892, in Fall River, Massachusetts. The murders, subsequent trial, and ensuing trial by media became a cause célèbre. Although Lizzie Borden was acquitted, no one else was ever arrested or tried and she has remained a notorious figure in American folklore. Dispute over the identity of the killer or killers continues to this day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Lizzie_borden.jpg/220px-Lizzie_borden.jpg
