52.4	Yugoslav_wars	Yugoslav Wars	The Yugoslav Wars were a series of wars, fought throughout the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1995. The wars were complex: characterized by bitter ethnic conflicts among the peoples of the former Yugoslavia, mostly between Serbs (and to a lesser extent, Montenegrins) on the one side and Croats and Bosniaks (and to a lesser degree, Slovenes) on the other; but also between Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia (in addition to a separate conflict fought between rival Bosniak factions in Bosnia). The wars ended in various stages and mostly resulted in full international recognition of new sovereign territories, but with massive economic disruption to the successor states.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Evstafiev-sarajevo-building-burns.jpg/300px-Evstafiev-sarajevo-building-burns.jpg
