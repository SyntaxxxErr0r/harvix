Prospective students, their parents and other visitors take campus tours to learn about the college or university's facilities, as well as student life, culture on campus, academics, and programs offered by the institution. These tours are normally walking tours that typically last anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes, and groups are usually between ten and thirty visitors. Campus tours are often preceded by an information session, presented by a member of the admissions staff. Many campus tours include a visit to a dorm room and a classroom or lecture hall. At most schools, tours are led by students, although admissions office staff or other representatives of the school may also be tour guides. At some institutions, becoming a student tour guide is a rigorous process and the job is a respected position on campus.
