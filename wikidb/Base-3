1.00	Base-3	Ternary numeral system	Ternary (sometimes called trinary) is the base-3 numeral system. Analogous to a bit, a ternary digit is a trit . One trit contains (about 1.58496) bits of information. Although ternary most often refers to a system in which the three digits 0, 1, and 2 are all whole numbers, the adjective also lends its name to the balanced ternary system, used in comparison logic and ternary computers.
