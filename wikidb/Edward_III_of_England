71.0	Edward_III_of_England	Edward III of England	Edward III (13 November 1312 – 21 June 1377) was King of England from 1327 until his death and is noted for his military success. Restoring royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father, Edward II, Edward III went on to transform the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His reign saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament—as well as the ravages of the Black Death. He remains one of only five monarchs to have ruled England or its successor kingdoms for more than fifty years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Royal_Arms_of_England_%281198-1340%29.svg/220px-Royal_Arms_of_England_%281198-1340%29.svg.png
