3.00	Two_Medicine_Formation	Two Medicine Formation	The Two Medicine Formation is a geologic formation, or rock body, that was deposited between 83.5 ± 0.7 Ma to 70.6 ± 3.4 Ma (million years ago), during Campanian time, and is located in northwestern Montana. It crops out to the east of the Rocky Mountain Overthrust Belt, and the western portion (about 600 m thick) of this formation is folded and faulted while the eastern part, which thins out into the Sweetgrass Arch, is mostly undeformed plains. Below the Two Medicine Fm. are the nearshore (beach and tidal zone) deposits of the Virgelle Sandstone, and above it is the marine Bearpaw Shale. Throughout the Campanian, the Two Medicine Fm. was deposited between the western shoreline of the Late Cretaceous Interior Seaway and the eastward advancing margin of the Cordilleran Overthrust Belt. The Two Medicine Fm. is mostly sandstone, deposited by rivers and deltas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Two_Medicine.jpg/220px-Two_Medicine.jpg
