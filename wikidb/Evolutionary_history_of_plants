While the groups which appeared earlier continue to thrive, especially in the environments in which they evolved, each new grade of organisation has eventually become more "successful" than its predecessors by most measures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Trilete_spores.png/220px-Trilete_spores.png
