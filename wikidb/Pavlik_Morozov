24.34	Pavlik_Morozov	Pavlik Morozov	Pavel Trofimovich Morozov (Russian: ; November 14, 1918 â€“ September 3, 1932), better known by the diminutive Pavlik, was a Soviet youth praised by the Soviet press as a martyr. His story, dated to 1932, is that of a 13-year old boy who denounced his father to the authorities and was in turn killed by his family. His story was a subject of reading, songs, plays, a symphonic poem, a full-length opera and six biographies. The cult had a huge impact on the moral norms of generations of children. There is very little original evidence related to the story, much of it hearsay provided by second-hand witnesses. According to modern research, the story (denunciation, trial) is most likely false, although Pavlik was a real child who was killed. Morozov's story was the basis of Bezhin Meadow, an unreleased film from 1937 that was directed by Sergei Eisenstein.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Pavel_Morozov.jpg/180px-Pavel_Morozov.jpg
