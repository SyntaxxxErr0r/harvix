1.11	Celestial_horizon	Horizontal coordinate system	The horizontal coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system that uses the observer's local horizon as the fundamental plane. This coordinate system divides the sky into the upper hemisphere where objects are visible, and the lower hemisphere where objects cannot be seen since the earth is in the way. The great circle separating hemispheres are called celestial horizon or rational horizon. The pole of the upper hemisphere is called the zenith. The pole of the lower hemisphere is called the nadir.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Horizontal_coordinate_system_2.png
