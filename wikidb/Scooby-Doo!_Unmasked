2.01	Scooby-Doo!_Unmasked	Scooby-Doo! Unmasked	Scooby-Doo! Unmasked is the first Scooby-Doo! game released for the Nintendo DS. In the game, the player uses Scooby-Doo to take down enemies and collect clues for Velma. Scooby-Doo can change costumes which can give him different moves such as kung-fu and fly like a bat. Without using these costumes some levels may not be possible to finish. This is the third Scooby-Doo game to feature a laugh track. In the Nintendo DS game, there are a few minigames included to make use of its touchscreen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/SD_Unmasked.jpg/256px-SD_Unmasked.jpg
