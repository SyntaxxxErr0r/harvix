1.01	Amal_Ahmed_Abdul_Fatah	Personal life of Osama bin Laden	Bin Laden was raised as a devout Wahhabi. Osama's father ensured that he was regularly attending school. Osama attended schools with some Western curricula and culture. There is no evidence that Osama ever received full time education in a religious madrassa. Osama likely was educated for some of his primary school years in Syria and that may have been in connection to his mother's frequent visits to Latakia, Syria. By the time Osama was an 8th grader, "he was a solid if unspectacular student." Osama's mother remembered that he was "not an A student. He would pass exams with average grades."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Brumana_Mission_School.jpg/220px-Brumana_Mission_School.jpg
