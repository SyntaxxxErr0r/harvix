He was elected to the Pro Bowl in 1984. Though he played with many great Pittsburgh linebackers, he is considered one of the best from his peers, and some feel he did not get as much recognition as he deserved. He currently owns and operates Robin Cole's Unforgettable Sweets in the Pittsburgh area. He is also involved in the Obediah Cole Foundation, named after his father.
