At a time when the theatre in London was seen as a disreputable place, the German Reed family provided family-friendly entertainments for forty years, showing that respectable theatre could be popular.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/A_Sensation_Novel.jpg/220px-A_Sensation_Novel.jpg
