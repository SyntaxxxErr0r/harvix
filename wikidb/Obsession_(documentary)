2.10	Obsession_(documentary)	Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West	Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West, also called Obsession, is a 2005 documentary film about the perceived threat of radical Islam to Western civilization. Using extensive Arab television footage it claims to give an "insider's view" of the hatred preached by radicals to incite global jihad and seek world domination. It also draws parallels between World War II's Nazi movement and Islamism and the West's response to those threats.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/ObsessionRadicalIslam.jpg/220px-ObsessionRadicalIslam.jpg
