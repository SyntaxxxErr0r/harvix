2.00	Taming_the_Tiger	Taming the Tiger	Taming the Tiger is the sixteenth studio album by Joni Mitchell. It was released in 1998 and was widely believed to be the last album of new material Mitchell would ever release (though this was dispelled with the release of her 2007 album Shine). The title refers to the unexpected commercial and critical success of her previous album Turbulent Indigo. As of December 2007 , it has sold 133,000 copies in the US to date.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/Joni_Tiger.jpg/220px-Joni_Tiger.jpg
