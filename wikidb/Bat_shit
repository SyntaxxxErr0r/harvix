1.00	Bat_shit	Guano	Guano (via Spanish, ultimately from the Quechua wanu, meaning 'dung') is the excrement of seabirds, cave dwelling bats, and seals. Guano manure is an effective fertilizer due to its high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen and also its lack of odor. It was an important source of nitrates for gunpowder. Soil that is deficient in organic matter can be made more productive by addition of this manure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Chincha_guano_islands.JPG/220px-Chincha_guano_islands.JPG
