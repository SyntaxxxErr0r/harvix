3.10	ESP_Edwards_Series	ESP Edwards Series	The ESP Edwards brand instruments are produced for the Japanese market, originally consisting of Fender and Gibson replicas. They are generally considered to be of almost equal quality to the main ESP brand, the fundamental difference being the tonewoods. For example, the FR-130GT uses a maple neck and ash wings while the ESP Forest GT uses a maple neck and wings, but with a mahogany bottom and a white ash top. However, hardware such as pickups, tuners and tremolo are almost identical.
