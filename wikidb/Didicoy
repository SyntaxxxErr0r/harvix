1.00	Didicoy	Didicoy	Didicoy is a term of the Romanichal (the English branch of Romani or "Gypsies") for travellers with mixed Romani blood. There was often fierce competition between the groups, and the Romanichal tended to blame their own reputation for criminality on the didicoys and other nomadic groups masquerading as "Gypsies".
