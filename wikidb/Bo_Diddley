He was also known as "The Originator" because of his key role in the transition from the blues to rock &amp; roll, influencing a host of acts including Buddy Holly, Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, The Velvet Underground, The Who, The Yardbirds, and Eric Clapton. He introduced more insistent, driving rhythms and a hard-edged guitar sound on a wide-ranging catalog of songs. Accordingly, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and a Grammy Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. He was known in particular for his technical innovations, including his trademark rectangular guitar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Bo_Diddley_Prag_2005_02.jpg/220px-Bo_Diddley_Prag_2005_02.jpg
