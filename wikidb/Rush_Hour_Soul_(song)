1.00	Rush_Hour_Soul_(song)	Rush Hour Soul (song)	"Rush Hour Soul" is a song by the Britpop band Supergrass. It was the fourth and final single from their fourth album Life On Other Planets. The single failed to chart in the US, and was outside the Top 75 in the UK upon its release in August 2003, but this was probably because it was released around ten months after Life On Other Planets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/Supergrass_Rush_Hour_Soul.jpg/220px-Supergrass_Rush_Hour_Soul.jpg
