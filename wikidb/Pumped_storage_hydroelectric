1.00	Pumped_storage_hydroelectric	Pumped-storage hydroelectricity	Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH) is a type of hydroelectric power generation used by some power plants for load balancing. The method stores energy in the form of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost off-peak electric power is used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power. Although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall, the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand, when electricity prices are highest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Pumpstor_racoon_mtn.jpg/250px-Pumpstor_racoon_mtn.jpg
