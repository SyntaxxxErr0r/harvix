79.9	Chalk	Chalk	Chalk ( ) is a soft, white, porous sedimentary rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is calcium carbonate or CaCO3. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite plates shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. It is common to find chert or flint nodules embedded in chalk. Chalk can also refer to other compounds including magnesium silicate and calcium sulfate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/The_Needles.jpg/220px-The_Needles.jpg
