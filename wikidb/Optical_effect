2.10	Optical_effect	Compositing	Compositing is the combining of visual elements from separate sources into single images, often to create the illusion that all those elements are parts of the same scene. Live-action shooting for compositing is variously called "chroma key", "blue screen", "green screen" and other names. Today, most, though not all, compositing is achieved through digital image manipulation. Pre-digital compositing techniques, however, go back as far as the trick films of Georges Méliès in the late 19th century; and some are still in use.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/Keaton_Playhouse_1921.jpg/220px-Keaton_Playhouse_1921.jpg
