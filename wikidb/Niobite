3.00	Niobite	Columbite	Columbite, also called niobite, niobite-tantalite and columbate , is a black mineral group that is an ore of niobium. It has a submetallic luster and a high density and is a niobate of iron and manganese. This mineral group was first found in Haddam, USA. It forms a series with the tantalum-dominant analogue ferrotantalite and one with the manganese-dominant analogue manganocolumbite. The iron-rich member of the columbite group is ferrocolumbite. Some tin and tungsten may be present in the mineral. Yttrocolumbite is the yttrium-rich columbite with the formula (Y,U,Fe)(Nb,Ta)O4. It is a radioactive mineral found in Mozambique.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Columbite.jpg/240px-Columbite.jpg
