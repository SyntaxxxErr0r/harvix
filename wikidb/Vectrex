66.4	Vectrex	Vectrex	The Vectrex is a vector display-based video game console that was developed by Western Technologies/Smith Engineering. It was licensed and distributed first by General Consumer Electric (GCE), and then by Milton Bradley Company after their purchase of GCE. It was released in November 1982 at a retail price of $199 ($460 compensated for inflation); as Milton Bradley took over international marketing the price dropped to $150 and then $100 shortly before the video game crash of 1983. The Vectrex exited the market in early 1984.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/Vectrex_logo.png/250px-Vectrex_logo.png
