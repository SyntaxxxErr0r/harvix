71.9	Amuse-bouche	Amuse-bouche	An amuse-bouche or amuse-gueule is a single, bite-sized hors d’œuvre. Amuse-bouches are different from appetizers in that they are not ordered from a menu by patrons, but, when served, are done so according to the chef's selection alone. These, often accompanied by a complementing wine, are served as a little tingler for the taste buds both to prepare the guest for the meal and to offer a glimpse into the chef's approach to cooking.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Floris_Claesz._van_Dyck_001.jpg/180px-Floris_Claesz._van_Dyck_001.jpg
