1.00	ANSI_terminal	ANSI escape code	ANSI escape sequences are characters embedded in the text used to control formatting, color, and other output options on video text terminals. Almost all terminal emulators designed to show text output from a remote computer, and (except for Microsoft Windows) to show text output from local software, interpret at least some of the ANSI escape sequences.
