70.1	Schmidt_Sting_Pain_Index	Schmidt Sting Pain Index	The Schmidt Sting Pain Index (a.k.a. the Justin O. Schmidt Pain Index) is a pain scale rating the relative pain caused by different Hymenopteran stings. It is mainly the work of Justin O. Schmidt, an entomologist at the Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Arizona. Schmidt has published a number of papers on the subject and claims to have been stung by the majority of stinging Hymenoptera.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Wasp_May_2008-11.jpg/250px-Wasp_May_2008-11.jpg
