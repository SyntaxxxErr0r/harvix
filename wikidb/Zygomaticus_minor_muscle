2.10	Zygomaticus_minor_muscle	Zygomaticus minor muscle	The zygomaticus minor is a muscle of facial expression. It originates from malar bone and continues with orbicularis oculi on the lateral face of the Levator labii superioris and then inserts into the outer part of the upper lip. Do not confuse this with the Zygomaticus major, which insets into the angle of the mouth. It draws the upper lip backward, upward, and outward (used in making sad facial expressions). Like all muscles of facial expression, it is innervated by the facial nerve (CN VII).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Musculuszygomaticusminor.png/250px-Musculuszygomaticusminor.png
