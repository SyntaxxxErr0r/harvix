It is one of the first Greek statues to portray human emotion as a significant part of the subject. In this relief, the goddess Athena seems tired and mournful. Although the image of Athena is somewhat formulaic, the statue succeeds in capturing an emotion and showing it through the medium. The artist of this piece is unknown. The piece is 0.48 m high and made of white marble and is originally from the Athenian Acropolis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/ACMA_Ath%C3%A9na_contemplative.jpg/220px-ACMA_Ath%C3%A9na_contemplative.jpg
