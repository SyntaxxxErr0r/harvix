109.7	Gravitation	Gravitation	Gravitation, or gravity, is a natural phenomenon by which physical bodies attract with a force proportional to their mass . Gravitation is most familiar as the agent that gives weight to objects with mass and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped. Gravitation causes dispersed matter to coalesce, and coalesced matter to remain intact, thus accounting for the existence of the Earth, the Sun, and most of the macroscopic objects in the universe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Sir_Isaac_Newton_%281643-1727%29.jpg/170px-Sir_Isaac_Newton_%281643-1727%29.jpg
