73.2	Disneyland	Disneyland	Disneyland Park is a theme park located in Anaheim, California, owned and operated by the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts division of the Walt Disney Company. Known as Disneyland when it opened on July 17, 1955, and still almost universally referred to by that name, it is the only theme park to be designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. In 1998, the theme park was re-branded Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the larger Disneyland Resort complex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Disneyland_Park_Logo.svg/220px-Disneyland_Park_Logo.svg.png
