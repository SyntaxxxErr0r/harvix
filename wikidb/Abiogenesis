218.1	Abiogenesis	Abiogenesis	Abiogenesis or biopoiesis is the study of how biological life could arise from inorganic matter through natural processes. In particular, the term usually refers to the processes by which life on Earth may have arisen. The geologic era in which abiogenesis took place likely was the Eoarchean era, i.e. the time after the Hadean era in which the Earth was essentially molten.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Stromatolites.jpg/265px-Stromatolites.jpg
