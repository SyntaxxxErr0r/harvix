64.1	Philosophy_of_science	Philosophy of science	The philosophy of science is concerned with the assumptions, foundations, methods and implications of science. It is also concerned with the use and merit of science and sometimes overlaps metaphysics and epistemology by exploring whether scientific results are actually a study of truth. In addition to these central problems of science as a whole, many philosophers of science also consider problems that apply to particular sciences (e.g. philosophy of biology or philosophy of physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/PrirodneNauke.svg/100px-PrirodneNauke.svg.png
