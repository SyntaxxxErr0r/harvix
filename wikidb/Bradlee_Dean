1.20	Bradlee_Dean	You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International	You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International (YCRBYCHI) is a Christian youth ministry that holds assemblies, including Christian rap/metal music and discussions with students, in public schools. Founded by Bradlee Dean, the ministry is based in Annandale, Minnesota. The ministry's mission statement explains their aims to reshape America "by re-directing the current and future generations both morally and spiritually through education, media and the Judeo-Christian values found in our U.S. Constitution." The organization has garnered letters of support from school personnel, as well as some religious and political figures. At the same time, the ministry has also drawn controversy for using these assemblies for religious purposes, misleading school administrators about the nature of the program, propagating its views regarding abortion and homosexuality, and earning "thousands of dollars per event from public schools that later express surprise about the groupâ€™s brand of hardline Christianity." In March 2012 the youth ministry was listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-gay hate group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/YCRBYCHI.png/200px-YCRBYCHI.png
