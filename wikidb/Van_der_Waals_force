84.7	Van_der_Waals_force	Van der Waals force	Van der Waals forces include attractions between atoms, molecules, and surfaces, as well as other intermolecular forces. They differ from covalent and ionic bonding in that they are caused by correlations in the fluctuating polarizations of nearby particles (a consequence of quantum dynamics).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Dipole-dipole-interaction-in-HCl-2D.png/200px-Dipole-dipole-interaction-in-HCl-2D.png
