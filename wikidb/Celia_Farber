She wrote and edited a monthly feature column in Spin magazine entitled "Words From The Front" from 1987 to 1995, which was focused on the denialist agenda. She says that her interest in the field was sparked when, as an intern at Spin, she heard of AL-721, a lipid mixture derived from eggs that was proposed as an anti-HIV drug. She stated, "I was very young, and I believed instantly in the mythological fantasy that there was a quote 'cure' for AIDS that was being suppressed by the government and by the pharmaceutical industry."
