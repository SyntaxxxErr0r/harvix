23.74	Tapas_(Sanskrit)	Tapas (Sanskrit)	Tapasya in Sanskrit means "heat". In Vedic religion and Hinduism, it is used figuratively, denoting spiritual suffering, mortification or austerity, and also the spiritual ecstasy of a yogin or tāpasá (a Vriddhi derivative meaning "a practitioner of austerities, an ascetic"). In the Rigveda, the word is connected with the Soma cult. The adjective tapasvín means "wretched, poor, miserable", but also "an ascetic, someone practicing austerities".
