57.7	Manta_ray	Manta ray	The manta ray is the largest species of the rays in the family Myliobatidae. The largest known specimen was more than 7.6 metres (25 ft) across, with a weight of about 2,400 kilograms (5,300 lb). It ranges throughout waters of the world, typically around coral reefs. They have the largest brain-to-body ratio of the sharks, rays and skates (Elasmobranchii), a brain which is kept warm during lengthy dives to as deep as 500 metres (1,600 ft) in cold water. They are often described as "flying" through the water on their large "wings", and individuals have been observed to jump clear out of the water, possibly in a form of communication or play.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Manta_birostris-Thailand4.jpg/240px-Manta_birostris-Thailand4.jpg
