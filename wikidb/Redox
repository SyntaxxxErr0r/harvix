93.6	Redox	Redox	Redox reactions refer to all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed. This can be either a simple redox process, such as the oxidation of carbon to yield carbon dioxide () or the reduction of carbon by hydrogen to yield methane (CH4), or a complex process such as the oxidation of glucose () in the human body through a series of complex electron transfer processes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Redox_reaction.png/300px-Redox_reaction.png
