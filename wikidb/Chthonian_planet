7.30	Chthonian_planet	Chthonian planet	A chthonian planet ( , sometimes misspelled 'cthonian') is a hypothetical class of celestial objects resulting from the stripping away of a gas giant's hydrogen and helium atmosphere and outer layers, which is called hydrodynamic escape. Such atmospheric stripping is a likely result of proximity to a star. The remaining rocky or metallic core would resemble a terrestrial planet in many respects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Artist%E2%80%99s_impression_of_Corot-7b_.jpg/250px-Artist%E2%80%99s_impression_of_Corot-7b_.jpg
