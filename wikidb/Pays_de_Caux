It is a chalk plateau to the north of the Seine Estuary and extending to the cliffs on the English Channel coast - its coastline is known as the Côte d'Albâtre. In the east, it borders on the Pays de Bray where the strata below the chalk show through.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Le_Havre_dot.png/220px-Le_Havre_dot.png
