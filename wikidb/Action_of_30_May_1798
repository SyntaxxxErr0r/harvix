1.10	Action_of_30_May_1798	Action of 30 May 1798	After a brief exchange of fire, both French ships were run onshore close to the mouth of the River Dives where several of the landing barges that survived the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn the frigate the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the frigate and was protected from further attack by troops onshore until the ship could be brought into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles and repaired, eventually returning to Le Havre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Hydra_%26_Confiante.jpg/300px-Hydra_%26_Confiante.jpg
