2.00	Combo_(gaming)	Combo (video gaming)	In video games, a combo (short for combination) is a term that designates a set of actions performed in sequence, usually with strict timing limitations, that yield a significant benefit or advantage. The 1st combo was done in the Street Fighter II series. The term originates from fighting games where it is based upon the concept of a striking combination. It has been since applied more generally to everything from puzzle games and shoot 'em ups to sports games. Combos are either used as an essential gameplay element (more commonly), or used merely as a high score or attack power modifier, or simply as a way to exhibit a flamboyant playing style, not explicitly necessary for victory or survival.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Umk3_combo.jpg/220px-Umk3_combo.jpg
