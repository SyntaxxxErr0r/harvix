95.2	Photoelectric_effect	Photoelectric effect	In the photoelectric effect, electrons are emitted from matter (metals and non-metallic solids, liquids or gases) as a consequence of their absorption of energy from electromagnetic radiation of very short wavelength, such as visible or ultraviolet radiation. Electrons emitted in this manner may be referred to as photoelectrons. First observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, the phenomenon is also known as the Hertz effect, although the latter term has fallen out of general use. Hertz observed and then showed that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Photoelectric_effect.svg/175px-Photoelectric_effect.svg.png
