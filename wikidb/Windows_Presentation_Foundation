248.7	Windows_Presentation_Foundation	Windows Presentation Foundation	Developed by Microsoft, the Windows Presentation Foundation (or WPF) is a computer-software graphical subsystem for rendering user interfaces in Windows-based applications. WPF, previously known as "Avalon", was initially released as part of .NET Framework 3.0. Rather than relying on the older GDI subsystem, WPF utilizes DirectX. WPF attempts to provide a consistent programming model for building applications and provides a separation between the user interface and the business logic. It resembles similar XML-oriented object models, such as those implemented in XUL and SVG.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/DotNet3.0.svg/300px-DotNet3.0.svg.png
