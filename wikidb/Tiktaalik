71.6	Tiktaalik	Tiktaalik	Tiktaalik ( ) is a monospecific genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned "fish") from the late Devonian period, with many features akin to those of tetrapods (four-legged animals). It is an example from several lines of ancient sarcopterygian "fish" developing adaptations to the oxygen-poor shallow-water habitats of its time, which led to the evolution of tetrapods. Well-preserved fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Tiktaalik_belgium_II.jpg/220px-Tiktaalik_belgium_II.jpg
