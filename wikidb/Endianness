133.1	Endianness	Endianness	In computing, the term endian or endianness refers to the ordering of individually addressable sub-components within the representation of a larger data item as stored in external memory (or, sometimes, as sent on a serial connection). Each sub-component in the representation has a unique degree of significance, like the place value of digits in a decimal number. These sub-components are typically 16-, 32- or 64-bit words, 8-bit bytes, or even bits. Endianness is a difference in data representation at the hardware level and may or may not be transparent at higher levels, depending on factors such as the type of high level language used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Ei_mit_Spiraleierbecher.jpg/220px-Ei_mit_Spiraleierbecher.jpg
