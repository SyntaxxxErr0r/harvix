73.2	Decompression_sickness	Decompression sickness	Decompression sickness describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to a specific type of underwater diving hazard but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as caisson working, flying in unpressurised aircraft, and extra-vehicular activity from spacecraft.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Decompression_chamber.jpg/230px-Decompression_chamber.jpg
