77.2	Operation_Eagle_Claw	Operation Eagle Claw	Operation Eagle Claw (or Operation Evening Light or Operation Rice Bowl) was an American military operation ordered by President Jimmy Carter to attempt to put an end to the Iran hostage crisis by rescuing 52 Americans held captive at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran on 24 April 1980. The humiliating public debacle that ensued damaged American prestige worldwide and is believed by many, including Carter himself, to have played a major role in his defeat in the 1980 presidential election.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Eagle_Claw_wrecks_at_Desert_One_April_1980.jpg/300px-Eagle_Claw_wrecks_at_Desert_One_April_1980.jpg
