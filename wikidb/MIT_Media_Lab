54.1	MIT_Media_Lab	MIT Media Lab	The MIT Media Lab (also known as the Media Lab) is a laboratory of MIT School of Architecture and Planning. Devoted to research projects at the convergence of design, multimedia and technology, the Media Lab has been widely popularized since the 1990s by business and technology publications such as Wired and Red Herring for a series of practical inventions in the fields of wireless networks, field sensing, web browsers and the World Wide Web. More recently it has focused particularly on design and technologies that address social causes. The One Laptop per Child (OLPC) was one of the notable research efforts which grew out of the Media Lab.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/MIT_Media_Lab.jpg/250px-MIT_Media_Lab.jpg
