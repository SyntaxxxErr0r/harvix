82.5	Fannie_Mae	Fannie Mae	The Federal National Mortgage Association , commonly known as Fannie Mae, was founded in 1938 during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal. It is a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), though it has been a publicly traded company since 1968. The corporation's purpose is to expand the secondary mortgage market by securitizing mortgages in the form of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), allowing lenders to reinvest their assets into more lending and in effect increasing the number of lenders in the mortgage market by reducing the reliance on thrifts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Fannie_Mae.svg/180px-Fannie_Mae.svg.png
