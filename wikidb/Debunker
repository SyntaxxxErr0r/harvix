29.80	Debunker	Debunker	Australian Professorial Fellow Stephan Lewandowsky and John Cook, Climate Communication Fellow for the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland (and author at SkepticalScience.com) both warn about "backfire effects" in their Debunking Handbook. Backfire effects occur when science communicators accidentally reinforce false beliefs by trying to correct them. For instance, a speaker about global warming may end up reinforcing the crowd's beliefs that global warming is not happening.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Charles_Napier_Hemy_-_A_Nautical_Argument_1877.jpg/200px-Charles_Napier_Hemy_-_A_Nautical_Argument_1877.jpg
