1.00	Hereditary_Peers	Hereditary peer	Hereditary peers form part of the Peerage in the United Kingdom. There are over seven hundred peers who hold titles that may be inherited. Formerly, most of them were entitled to sit in the House of Lords, but since the House of Lords Act 1999 only ninety-two are permitted to do so. Peers are called to the House of Lords with a writ of summons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Queen_Anne_in_the_House_of_Lords.jpg/200px-Queen_Anne_in_the_House_of_Lords.jpg
