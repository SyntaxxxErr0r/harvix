1.40	Lynbrook_High_School	Lynbrook High School	Many of Lynbrook's buildings and facilities are in their original state and have not been significantly renovated. However, the bleachers in the main Gym were replaced between the years 2003 and 2006. Most of Lynbrook's buildings are constructed of old brick exteriors. New structures and facilities built since 1990 include the library, swimming pool, field house, and Voyager buildings. During the summer in 2009, the parking lot was renovated and solar panels were added.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Lynbrook_Library.jpg/350px-Lynbrook_Library.jpg
