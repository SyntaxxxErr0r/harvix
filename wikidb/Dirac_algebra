1.00	Dirac_algebra	Dirac algebra	In mathematical physics, the Dirac algebra is the Clifford algebra Cℓ1,3 . This was introduced by the mathematical physicist P. A. M. Dirac in 1928 in developing the Dirac equation for spin-½ particles with a matrix representation with the Dirac gamma matrices, which represent the generators of the algebra.
