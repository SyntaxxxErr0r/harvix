They also moved into the Cardinals Stadium in Glendale, Arizona (one of the western suburbs of Phoenix). The stadium was christened University of Phoenix Stadium on September 26. Despite a somewhat promising start, the team suffered a few setbacks, including key losses to the Dallas Cowboys and the eventual NFC Champion Chicago Bears, and ended the season (again) at a disappointing 5-11 record. Head coach Dennis Green was fired after the season, replaced by Ken Whisenhunt.
