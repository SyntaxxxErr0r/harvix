99.6	Statistical_significance	Statistical significance	In statistics, a result is called "statistically significant" if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. The phrase test of significance was coined by Ronald Fisher. As used in statistics, significant does not mean important or meaningful, as it does in everyday speech. Research analysts who focus solely on significant results may miss important response patterns which individually may fall under the threshold set for tests of significance. Many researchers urge that tests of significance should always be accompanied by effect-size statistics, which approximate the size and thus the practical importance of the difference.
