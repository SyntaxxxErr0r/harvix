8.20	Giovinezza	Giovinezza	"Giovinezza" (Italian for youth) is the official hymn of the Italian National Fascist Party, regime, and army, and was the unofficial national anthem of Italy between 1924 and 1943. Although often sung with the official national anthem Marcia Reale, some sources consider Giovinezza to have supplanted the Royal March as the de facto national anthem of Italy, to the dismay of Victor Emmanuel III of Italyâ€”a powerful symbol of the diarchy between the King and Mussolini. It was subsequently the official anthem of the Italian Social Republic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Giovenezza.gif/220px-Giovenezza.gif
