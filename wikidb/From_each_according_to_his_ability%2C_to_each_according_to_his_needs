2.10	From_each_according_to_his_ability%2C_to_each_according_to_his_needs	From each according to his ability, to each according to his need	From each according to his ability, to each according to his need (or needs) is a slogan popularised by Karl Marx in his 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program. In German, "Jeder nach seinen Fähigkeiten, jedem nach seinen Bedürfnissen!". In the Marxist view, such an arrangement will be made possible by the abundance of goods and services that a developed communist society will produce; the idea is that there will be enough to satisfy everyone's needs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Marx_color2.jpg/110px-Marx_color2.jpg
