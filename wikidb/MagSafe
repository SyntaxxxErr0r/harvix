54.3	MagSafe	MagSafe	MagSafe is a proprietary magnetically-attached power connector introduced by Apple Inc. on January 10, 2006 in conjunction with the MacBook Pro at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco. The MagSafe connector is held in place by a magnet so that if it is tugged on, for example by someone tripping over the cord, it will pull out of the socket safely, without damaging the connector or the computer power socket, or pulling the computer off of the surface on which it is located. MagSafe works exactly the same as the magnetic power connectors that many deep fryers and Japanese countertop cooking appliances from the early 2000s have in order to avoid spilling their dangerously hot contents. Apple exclusively owns US Patent No. 7311526 ("Magnetic connector for electronic device", issued in 2007) and does not license the MagSafe connector or the patent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/MagSafe-Pinout.svg/200px-MagSafe-Pinout.svg.png
