1.01	Snow_mobile	Snowmobile	A snowmobile, also known in some places as a snowmachine, or sled, is a land vehicle for winter travel on snow. Designed to be operated on snow and ice, they require no specific road or trail. Design variations enable some machines to operate in deep snow or forests; most are used on open terrain, including frozen lakes, or driven on paths or trails. Usually designed to accommodate two people, their use is much like a motorcycle and an all-terrain vehicle (ATVs) intended for winter use on snow-covered ground and frozen ponds and waterways. They have no enclosure except for a windshield and their engine normally drives a continuous track or tracks at the rear; skis at the front provide directional control.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/SnowmobilesYellowstone.jpg/300px-SnowmobilesYellowstone.jpg
