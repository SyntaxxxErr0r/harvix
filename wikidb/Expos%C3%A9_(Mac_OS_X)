72.4	Expos%C3%A9_(Mac_OS_X)	Exposé (Mac OS X)	Exposé is a feature of the Mac OS X operating system. First previewed on 23 June 2003 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a feature of the then forthcoming Mac OS X v10.3, Exposé allows a user to quickly locate an open window, or to hide all windows and show the desktop without the need to click through many windows to find a specific target. It has been replaced in Mac OS X 10.7 by Mission Control.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ea/Exposeleopardall.png/220px-Exposeleopardall.png
