The current speaker is John Boehner, a Republican who represents Ohio's 8th congressional district. The Constitution does not require that the Speaker be an elected Member of Congress, but no non-member has ever been elected Speaker.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Seal_of_the_Speaker_of_the_US_House_of_Representatives.svg/100px-Seal_of_the_Speaker_of_the_US_House_of_Representatives.svg.png
