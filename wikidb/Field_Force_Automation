1.00	Field_Force_Automation	Field force automation	Field force automation refers to the use of technology to capture field sales or service information in real time. This involves use of technology, typically handheld PDAs, wireless devices, tablet PCs or mobile phones to capture data. The captured data is transferred immediately to back end systems (ERP, CRM or accounting systems) through wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi, 3G, satellite or GPRS). This instant capture of information reduces time delays, avoids manual double entry data errors and enhances field force productivity. From an operations perspective, availability of field information in near real time allows to plan delivery schedules, reduce inventory and monitor &amp; control the field workers.
