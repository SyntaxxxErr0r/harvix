15.21	Viewtron	Viewtron	Viewtron was an early online service offered by Knight-Ridder and AT&amp;T. It started as a videotex service requiring users to have a special terminal, the AT&amp;T Sceptre, then became a computer-based service as Commodore and other personal computers became important in the marketplace. Viewtron used the NAPLPS graphics language to provide a user interface that was graphically sophisticated by the standards of the time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Viewtron_main_menu_screen.jpg
