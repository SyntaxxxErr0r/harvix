8.34	Incorporeal	Incorporeality	Incorporeal or uncarnate means without the nature of a body or substance. The idea of incorporeality refers to the notion that there is an incorporeal realm of existence, or "place", that is distinct from the corporeal or material universe. Incorporeal beings or objects are not made out of matter in the way a physical, material being or object exists. The idea of the immaterial is often used in reference to the Christian God or the Divine. This being has at times been defined as the Prime Mover or First Cause that exists in an incorporeal or intelligible realm that transcends both space and time, especially in the physical realm. The notion that incorporeality is even possible requires the belief that something can exist or affect the physical, matter or energy, without physically existing at the point of effect. A ball can directly affect another ball by coming in direct contact with it, and is visible because it reflects the light that directly reaches it. An incorporeal object or being could not perform these functions in a way we are familiar with because they have no material construction with which to perform these functions. It is possible that the incorporeal realm has powers we are not aware of with which to effect matter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini_-_Dove_of_the_Holy_Spirit.JPG/120px-Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini_-_Dove_of_the_Holy_Spirit.JPG
