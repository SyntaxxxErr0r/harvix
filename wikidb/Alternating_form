2.10	Alternating_form	Exterior algebra	In mathematics, the exterior product or wedge product of vectors is an algebraic construction used in Euclidean geometry to study areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogs. The exterior product of two vectors u and v, denoted by u ∧ v, is called a bivector and lives in a space called the exterior square, a geometrical vector space that differs from the original space of vectors. The magnitude of u ∧ v can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides u and v, which in three-dimensions can also be computed using the cross product of the two vectors. Also like the cross product, the exterior product is anticommutative, meaning that for all vectors u and v. One way to visualize a bivector is as a family of parallelograms all lying in the same plane, having the same area, and with the same orientation of their boundaries—a choice of clockwise or counterclockwise. When regarded in this manner the exterior product of two vectors is called a 2-blade. More generally, the exterior product of any number k of vectors can be defined and is sometimes called a k-blade. It lives in a geometrical space known as the k-th exterior power. The magnitude of the resulting k-blade is the volume of the k-dimensional parallelotope whose sides are the given vectors, just as the magnitude of the scalar triple product of vectors in three dimensions gives the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by those vectors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Exterior_calc_cross_product.png/220px-Exterior_calc_cross_product.png
