95.7	Genetic_engineering	Genetic engineering	Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification, is the direct human manipulation of an organism's genome using modern DNA technology. It involves the introduction of foreign DNA or synthetic genes into the organism of interest. The introduction of new DNA does not require the use of classical genetic methods, however traditional breeding methods are typically used for the propagation of recombinant organisms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Genetic-engineering-wheat.jpg/220px-Genetic-engineering-wheat.jpg
