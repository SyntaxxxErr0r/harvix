18.81	Upper_Canada_Rebellion	Upper Canada Rebellion	The Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the oligarchic government of the British colony of Upper Canada (present day Ontario) in late 1837. While public grievances had existed for years, it was the Lower Canada Rebellion in Lower Canada (present day Quebec) that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt soon after. The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered into 1838 (and became more violent) - mainly through the support of the 'Hunter Patriots' (aka Hunters' Lodges), a secret anti-British, American militia that emerged in states around the Great Lakes during the first half of the 19th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Battle_of_the_Windmill.jpg/300px-Battle_of_the_Windmill.jpg
