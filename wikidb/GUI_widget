The defining characteristic of a widget is to provide a single interaction point for the direct manipulation of a given kind of data. In other words, widgets are basic visual building blocks which, combined in an application, hold all the data processed by the application and the available interactions on this data.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Widgets.png/300px-Widgets.png
