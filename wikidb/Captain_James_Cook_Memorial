The memorial includes a water jet located in the central basin and a skeleton globe sculpture at Regatta Point of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, showing the paths of Cook's expeditions. On 25 April 1970, Queen Elizabeth II officially inaugurated the memorial.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Captain_Cook_Memorial.jpg/220px-Captain_Cook_Memorial.jpg
