13.61	Clinton_Chronicles	The Clinton Chronicles	The Clinton Chronicles: An Investigation into the Alleged Criminal Activities of Bill Clinton is a 1994 film created by Patrick Matrisciana. This video explored a number of deaths (including that of Vincent Foster) and an alleged cocaine-smuggling operation, all of which purportedly involved BCCI, Dan Lasater and the then Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton. These deaths were part of a conspiracy theory known as the "Clinton Body Count", which started and grew from around the time of the documentary, as connections to Clinton were added with varying degrees of allegedly suspicious circumstances surrounding the deaths. Some of the names in the Clinton Body Count are referenced in the documentary. The deaths of Kevin Ives and Don Henry spawned two other documentaries listed below.
