79.6	Wetland	Wetland	A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on characteristics that distinguish it as a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands is the characteristic vegetation that is adapted to its unique soil conditions: Wetlands are made up primarily of hydric soil, which supports aquatic plants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Mangrove_trees_in_Everglades.JPG/250px-Mangrove_trees_in_Everglades.JPG
