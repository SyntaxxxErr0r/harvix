2.00	Blazars	Blazar	Blazars, like all AGN, are thought to be ultimately powered by material falling onto a supermassive black hole at the center of the host galaxy. Gas, dust and the occasional star are captured and spiral into this central black hole creating a hot accretion disk which generates enormous amounts of energy in the form of photons, electrons, positrons and other elementary particles. This region is quite small, approximately 10âˆ’3 parsecs in size.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Galaxies_AGN_Jet_Line-of-Sight.jpg
