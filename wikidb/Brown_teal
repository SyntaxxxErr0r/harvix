1.00	Brown_teal	Brown Teal	The Brown Teal or New Zealand Teal, is a species of dabbling duck of the genus Anas. The Māori name for it is Pāteke. It was considered to be conspecific with the flightless Auckland and Campbell Teals in Anas aucklandica; the name "Brown Teal" was applied to that entire taxon. The Brown Teal has since been split, recognizing that the insular A. aucklandica and A. nesiotis are good species. In international use, the name Brown Teal is still more common than New Zealand Teal for this bird.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Brown_Teal_Male.JPG/250px-Brown_Teal_Male.JPG
