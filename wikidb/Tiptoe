2.00	Tiptoe	Tiptoe	Tiptoe describes the human body posture and locomotion of removing the heel(s) of one or both feet from the ground. It is quite often used as a slang when the weight is placed on the balls of the feet, rather than literally the tips of the toes (which is very difficult), although it could still be used in that case (as in ballet).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/PointeShoes.jpg/170px-PointeShoes.jpg
