2.01	K%C3%B6lsch_(dialect)	Kölsch dialect	Kölsch (Colognian, Kölsch: ) is a very closely related small set of dialects, or variants, of the Ripuarian Central German group of languages. Kölsch is spoken in and partially around Cologne in the area covered by the Archdiocese and former Electorate of Cologne reaching from Neuss in the north to just south of Bonn, west to Düren and east to Olpe in the North-West of Germany. Kölsch is one of the very few city dialects in Germany, besides for example the dialect spoken in Berlin. Kölsch is one of the few dialects of German where the eszett can appear in double form; for example, in the word ėßß ("is").
