67.1	Image_resolution	Image resolution	The measure of how closely lines can be resolved in an image is called spatial resolution, and it depends on properties of the system creating the image, not just the pixel resolution in pixels per inch (ppi). For practical purposes the clarity of the image is decided by its spatial resolution, not the number of pixels in an image. In effect, spatial resolution refers to the number of independent pixel values per unit length.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Resolution_illustration.png
