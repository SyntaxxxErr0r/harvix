7.23	Royal_Commonwealth_Society	Royal Commonwealth Society	The Royal Commonwealth Society (RCS) (originally named the Colonial Society and later the Royal Empire Society) is an international educational charity and a private members' club. Its mission is to support and promote the modern Commonwealth, its culture and core values. The RCS’s London home, the Commonwealth Club, acts as a centre for the exchange of ideas and, through the Society’s broad-ranging public affairs programme, offers a forum for the debate, research and development of Commonwealth thinking on key international issues. The Club also acts as a centre for the celebration of Commonwealth art and culture, and leading artists frequently exhibit their work in the Gallery space.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Commonwealth_Club_1.JPG/220px-Commonwealth_Club_1.JPG
