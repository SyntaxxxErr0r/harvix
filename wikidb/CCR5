72.3	CCR5	CCR5	C-C chemokine receptor type 5, also known as CCR5 or CD195, is a protein on the surface of white blood cells that is involved in the immune system as it acts as a receptor for chemokines. Many forms of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, initially use CCR5 to enter and infect host cells. A few individuals carry a mutation known as CCR5 delta 32 in the CCR5 gene, protecting them against these strands of HIV.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Protein_CCR5_PDB_1ND8.png/250px-Protein_CCR5_PDB_1ND8.png
