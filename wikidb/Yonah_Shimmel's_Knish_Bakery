7.10	Yonah_Shimmel's_Knish_Bakery	Yonah Shimmel's Knish Bakery	Yonah Shimmel's Knish Bakery is a bakery that has been selling knishes on the Lower East Side of the New York City borough of Manhattan since 1890 from its original location on Houston Street. As the Lower East Side has changed over the decades and many of its Jewish residents have departed, Yonah Schimmel's is one of the few distinctly Jewish businesses and restaurants that remain as a fixture of this largely departed culture and cuisine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Yonah_Shimmel_Knish_Bakery.jpg/250px-Yonah_Shimmel_Knish_Bakery.jpg
