3.00	Encog	Encog	Encog is a neural network and artificial intelligence framework available for Java, .Net, and Silverlight. Encog contains classes to create a wide variety of networks, as well as support classes to normalize and process data for these neural networks. Encog trains using many different techniques. Multithreading is used to allow optimal training performance on multicore machines. Encog can offload some processing to an OpenCL compatible GPU for further performance gains.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Encog128.png
