3.00	Control_states	Alcoholic beverage control state	Among those states which chose not to maintain complete prohibition over alcoholic beverages, approximately one third established government monopolies while the remaining two thirds established private license systems. In its simplest terms, the license system allows private enterprises to buy and sell alcohol at state discretion. In actual effect, the license operates as a device of restraint and not merely a grant of privilege or freedom. In a constitutional sense, the license confers no property right and the exercise of its privilege is continuously contingent upon the holderâ€™s compliance with required conditions and the general discretion of the licensing authority. The remaining states adopted the monopoly system of regulation, the more cautious of the two regulatory frameworks. As alluded to above, under the monopoly scheme the government takes over the wholesale trade and conducts the retail sale of heavier alcoholic beverages through its own stores. That is, the state itself engages in the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. Most of these states have an "Alcoholic Beverage Control" (ABC) board and run package stores called ABC stores. It is also worth noting that in all monopoly states a parallel license system is used to regulate the sale and distribution of lighter alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/2008-09-24_ABC_Liquors_on_Hillsborough_Rd_in_Durham.jpg/220px-2008-09-24_ABC_Liquors_on_Hillsborough_Rd_in_Durham.jpg
