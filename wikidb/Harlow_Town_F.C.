2.00	Harlow_Town_F.C.	Harlow Town F.C.	1960 was a noteworthy year in the history of Harlow Town; they won the London League Cup and moved from the Green Man playing fields (where they had played since 1879) to the new Harlow Sportcentre on Hammarskjold Road (the first sports centre in England). The opening game for the new ground featured Essex XI vs. London League XI, with two Harlow players on each side (including the club's record appearance-maker Norman Gladwin in goal for Essex). Essex won the match, 3-2. The official opening of the ground was on 1 October, when Saffron Waldon visited in the FA Amateur Cup (with FA Secretary Sir Stanley Rous present). Harlow won, 2-0. Rous confirmed that "The Town" had been given associate membership to the FA, a milestone for the club. That year Harlow appointed John Kavanagh, former England Amateur International, as the new first-team manager. The club finished third in their first season at their new home, their final season in the London League. For the 1961-62 season, Harlow moved to the more-competitive Delphian League to put itself on the non-league map. They were attracting better players, due to their move to the Sportcentre and Kavanagh's leadership. However, they finished in the bottom half of the Delphian League for two years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/Harlow_Town_FC.jpg/150px-Harlow_Town_FC.jpg
