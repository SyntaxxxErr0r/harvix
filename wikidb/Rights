57.2	Rights	Rights	Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/RNC_04_protest_89.jpg/220px-RNC_04_protest_89.jpg
