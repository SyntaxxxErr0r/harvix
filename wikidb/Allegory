57.4	Allegory	Allegory	Allegory is a device used to present an idea, principle or meaning, which can be presented in literary form, such as a poem or novel, in musical form, such as composition or lyric, or in visual form, such as in painting or drawing. It is also seen in scriptural passage. Allegory communicates its message by means of symbolic figures, actions or symbolic representation. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of rhetoric; a rhetorical allegory is a demonstrative form of representation conveying meaning other than the words that are spoken.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Filippino_Lippi_001.jpg/220px-Filippino_Lippi_001.jpg
