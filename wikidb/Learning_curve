56.9	Learning_curve	Learning curve	A learning curve is a graphical representation of the changing rate of learning (in the average person) for a given activity or tool. Typically, the increase in retention of information is sharpest after the initial attempts, and then gradually evens out, meaning that less and less new information is retained after each repetition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Steeplearningcurve1_de.png/100px-Steeplearningcurve1_de.png
