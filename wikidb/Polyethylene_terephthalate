120.0	Polyethylene_terephthalate	Polyethylene terephthalate	Polyethylene terephthalate (sometimes written poly(ethylene terephthalate)), commonly abbreviated PET, PETE, or the obsolete PETP or PET-P, is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in synthetic fibers; beverage, food and other liquid containers; thermoforming applications; and engineering resins often in combination with glass fiber. The term polyethylene terephthalate is a source of confusion because this substance, PET, does not contain polyethylene. Thus, the alternate form, poly(ethylene terephthalate), is often used in scholarly journals for the sake of accuracy and clarity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Polyethylene_terephthalate.svg/300px-Polyethylene_terephthalate.svg.png
