20.80	Art_of_war	The Art of War	The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise that is attributed to Sun Tzu (also referred to as "Sunzi" and "Sun Wu"), a high ranking military general and strategist during the late Spring and Autumn period (some scholars believe that the Art of War was not completed until the subsequent Warring States period). Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare. It is said to be the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time, and is still read for its military insight.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Inscribed_bamboo-slips_of_Art_of_War.jpg/300px-Inscribed_bamboo-slips_of_Art_of_War.jpg
