78.0	Linear_algebra	Linear algebra	Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics charged with investigating the properties of finite dimensional vector spaces and linear mappings between such spaces. Such an investigation is initially motivated by a system of linear equations in several unknowns. Such equations are naturally represented using the formalism of matrices and vectors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Linear_subspaces_with_shading.svg/250px-Linear_subspaces_with_shading.svg.png
