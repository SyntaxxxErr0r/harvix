60.0	Weathering	Weathering	Weathering is the breaking down of rocks, soils and minerals as well as artificial materials through contact with the Earth's atmosphere, biota and waters. Weathering occurs in situ, or "with no movement", and thus should not be confused with erosion, which involves the movement of rocks and minerals by agents such as water, ice, snow, wind and gravity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/KharazaArch.jpg/300px-KharazaArch.jpg
