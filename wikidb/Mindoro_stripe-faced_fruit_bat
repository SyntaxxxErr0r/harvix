2.10	Mindoro_stripe-faced_fruit_bat	Mindoro Stripe-faced Fruit Bat	The Mindoro Stripe-faced Fruit Bat , nicknamed the "flying fox" for its foxlike face (although it is not a flying fox bat), is a species of large Philippine megabat. It is endemic to the island of Mindoro. S. mindorensis is a typical fruit bat, possessing modified forearms for flight, short clawed hind legs and large ears for use in echolocation. The bat shares many anatomical features with the rest of its genus, which was originally described from just one species. These include an overall orange pelage, a white stripe down the middle of the bat's rostrum and white spots above its eyes. S. mindorensis can be distinguished from the other member of its genus by its possession of multicusped lower and upper canine teeth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Distribution_Styloctenium.png
