179.7	Logic	Logic	Logic (from the Greek λογική logikē) is the philosophical study of valid reasoning. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of philosophy, mathematics, semantics, and computer science. It examines general forms which arguments may take, which forms are valid, and which are fallacies. In philosophy, the study of logic is applied in most major areas: metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, and ethics. In mathematics, it is the study of valid inferences within some formal language. Logic is also studied in argumentation theory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/Philbar.png/158px-Philbar.png
