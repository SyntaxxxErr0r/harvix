7.00	Carl_Anton_Larsen	Carl Anton Larsen	Carl Anton Larsen (August 7, 1860 â€“ December 8, 1924) was a Norwegian Antarctic Explorer, who made important contributions to the exploration of Antarctica, the most significant being the first discovery of fossils, for which he received the Back Grant from the Royal Geographical Society. In December 1893 he became the first person to ski in Antarctica on the Larsen Ice Shelf which was subsequently named after him. Larsen is considered the founder of the Antarctic whaling industry and the settlement at Grytviken on the British-administered island of South Georgia. In 1910, after some years' residence on South Georgia, he took British citizenship.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Carl-Anton-Larsen.jpg/200px-Carl-Anton-Larsen.jpg
