72.5	Sacred_geometry	Sacred geometry	Sacred geometry is the geometry used in the planning and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, tabernacles; as well as for sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred groves, village greens and holy wells, and the creation of religious art. In sacred geometry, symbolic and sacred meanings are ascribed to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions, according to Paul Calter:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Kepler-solar-system-2.png/230px-Kepler-solar-system-2.png
