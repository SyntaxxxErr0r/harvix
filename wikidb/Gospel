98.7	Gospel	Gospel	A gospel is an account, often written, that describes the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The most widely-known examples of gospel are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. However, the term is also used to refer to the apocryphal gospels, the non-canonical gospels, the Jewish gospels and the gnostic gospels. Christians may additionally use the term "gospel" in reference to the general message of the biblical New Testament, otherwise known as the "good news".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Sargis_Pitsak.jpg/220px-Sargis_Pitsak.jpg
