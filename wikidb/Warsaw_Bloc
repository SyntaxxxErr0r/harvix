The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organisation for the communist states of Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was a Soviet military response to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955, per the Paris Pacts of 1954.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Military_power_of_NATO_and_the_Warsaw_Pact_states_in_1973.svg/220px-Military_power_of_NATO_and_the_Warsaw_Pact_states_in_1973.svg.png
