79.9	Reverse_proxy	Reverse proxy	In computer networks, a reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. These resources are then returned to the client as though they originated from the reverse proxy itself. While a forward proxy acts as an intermediary for its (usually nearby) associated client(s) and returns to them most resources accessible on the Internet, a reverse proxy acts as an intermediary for its (usually nearby) associated server(s) and only returns resources provided by those associated server(s).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Reverse_proxy_h2g2bob.svg/280px-Reverse_proxy_h2g2bob.svg.png
