The structure was extended and enlarged over the centuries, particularly after the 16th century. It was at this time that the fortress was converted into a royal palace, and Madrid became the capital of the Spanish Empire. Despite being a palace, the great building kept its original title of Alcázar (English: "fortress").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Alcazar_de_Madrid_siglo_XVII.jpg/250px-Alcazar_de_Madrid_siglo_XVII.jpg
