77.2	Ambigram	Ambigram	An ambigram is an art form that may be read as one or more words not only in its form as presented, but also from another viewpoint from the original words. Douglas R. Hofstadter describes an ambigram as a "calligraphic design that manages to squeeze two different readings into the selfsame set of curves." Different ambigram artists (sometimes called ambigramists) may create completely different ambigrams from the same word or words, differing in both style and form.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Ambigram_rotating.gif
