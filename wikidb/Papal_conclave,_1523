1.00	Papal_conclave,_1523	Papal conclave, 1523	Adrian VI experienced ill health during the final months of his life, inspiring the cardinals to begin politicking. Francis I of France had just dispatched a large army into northern Italy in 1522, and expecting to leverage this force to effect the election of French cardinal Jean de Lorraine, or more likely a pro-French Italian cardinal such as Niccol√≤ Fieschi. However, his army experienced a major defeat at the Battle of Bicocca prior to the conclave. In any case, the three French cardinals were ordered by Francis I to rush to Rome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Battle_of_Bicocca_%28diagram%29.png/220px-Battle_of_Bicocca_%28diagram%29.png
