30.32	Bird_anatomy	Bird anatomy	Bird anatomy, or the physiological structure of birds' bodies, shows many unique adaptations, mostly aiding flight. Birds have a light skeletal system and light but powerful musculature which, along with circulatory and respiratory systems capable of very high metabolic rates and oxygen supply, permit the bird to fly. The development of a beak has led to evolution of a specially adapted digestive system. These anatomical specializations have earned birds their own class in the vertebrate phylum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Birdmorphology.svg/300px-Birdmorphology.svg.png
