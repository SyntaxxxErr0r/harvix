60.7	Distance	Distance	Distance is a numerical description of how far apart objects are. In physics or everyday discussion, distance may refer to a physical length, or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. "two counties over"). In mathematics, a distance function or metric is a generalization of the concept of physical distance. A metric is a function that behaves according to a specific set of rules, and provides a concrete way of describing what it means for elements of some space to be "close to" or "far away from" each other.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Distance_between_sets.svg/220px-Distance_between_sets.svg.png
