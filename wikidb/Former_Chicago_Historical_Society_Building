Built in 1892, it is a prime example of Henry Ives Cobb's Romanesque Revival architecture, and the home of the Chicago Historical Society prior to relocating to Lincoln Park. This large granite-clad building is simply known as "Excalibur" or "Vision" by Chicago's populace, because it houses two popular nightclubs with those names. Henceforth, Excalibur will be used as a substitute title to the cumbersome name "Former Chicago Historical Society Building."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Chicago_Historical_Society%2C_632_North_Dearborn_Street%2C_Chicago_%28Cook_County%2C_Illinois%29.jpg/250px-Chicago_Historical_Society%2C_632_North_Dearborn_Street%2C_Chicago_%28Cook_County%2C_Illinois%29.jpg
