The effort to found what was to be called St. Mary's Mission predated the establishment of the English settlement at Jamestown by about 36 years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Mission_San_Juan_Capistrano_postcard_1920.jpg/220px-Mission_San_Juan_Capistrano_postcard_1920.jpg
