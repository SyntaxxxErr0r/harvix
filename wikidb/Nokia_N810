57.4	Nokia_N810	Nokia N810	The Nokia N810 Internet tablet is an Internet appliance from Nokia, announced on 17 October, 2007 at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco. Despite Nokia's strong association with cellular products, the N810 is not a phone, but instead allows the user to browse the Internet and communicate using Wi-Fi networks or with a mobile phone via Bluetooth. It builds on the hardware and software of the Nokia N800 with some features added and some removed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/N810-open.jpg/200px-N810-open.jpg
