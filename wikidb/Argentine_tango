51.3	Argentine_tango	Argentine tango	Argentine tango is a musical genre of simple quadruple metre and binary musical form, and the social dance that accompanies it. Its lyrics and music are marked by nostalgia, expressed through melodic instruments including the bandoneón. Originated at the ending of the 19th century in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, it quickly grew in popularity and spread internationally. Among its leading figures are the singer and songwriter Carlos Gardel, composer Mariano Mores and performers Osvaldo Pugliese and Ástor Piazzolla.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Tango_couple_closeup.jpg/220px-Tango_couple_closeup.jpg
