53.1	Dismissal_of_U.S._attorneys_controversy	Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy	The dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy was initiated by the unprecedented midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys on December 7, 2006 by the George W. Bush administration's Department of Justice. Congressional investigations focused on whether the Department of Justice and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage. Allegations were that some of the attorneys were targeted for dismissal to impede investigations of Republican politicians or that some were targeted for their failure to initiate investigations that would damage Democratic politicians or hamper Democratic-leaning voters. The U.S. attorneys were replaced with interim appointees, under provisions in the 2005 USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Alberto_Gonzales_-_official_DoJ_photograph.jpg/170px-Alberto_Gonzales_-_official_DoJ_photograph.jpg
