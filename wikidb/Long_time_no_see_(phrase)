6.21	Long_time_no_see_(phrase)	Long time no see	"Long time no see" is an English expression used as a greeting by people who have not seen each other for a while. Its origins in American English appear to be an imitation of broken or pidgin English,and despite its ungrammaticality it is widely accepted as a fixed expression. The phrase is a multiword expression that cannot be explained by the usual rules of English grammar due to the irregular syntax. It may derive ultimately from an English pidgin such as that spoken by Native Americans or Chinese, but there is no conclusive evidence for either.
