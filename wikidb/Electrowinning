10.10	Electrowinning	Electrowinning	Electrowinning, also called electroextraction, is the electrodeposition of metals from their ores that have been put in solution or liquefied. Electrorefining uses a similar process to remove impurities from a metal. Both processes use electroplating on a large scale and are important techniques for the economical and straightforward purification of non-ferrous metals. The resulting metals are said to be electrowon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Electrorefining_technology_anl_gov.jpg/220px-Electrorefining_technology_anl_gov.jpg
