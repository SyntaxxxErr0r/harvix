89.6	Parents_Music_Resource_Center	Parents Music Resource Center	The Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) was an American committee formed in 1985 with the stated goal of increasing parental control over the access of children to music deemed to be violent, have drug use or be sexual via labeling and censorship. The committee was founded by four women: Tipper Gore, wife of Senator and later Vice President Al Gore; Susan Baker, wife of Treasury Secretary James Baker; Pam Howar, wife of Washington realtor Raymond Howar; and Sally Nevius, wife of former Washington City Council Chairman John Nevius. They were known as the "Washington wives" â€“ a reference to their husbands' connections with government in the Washington, D.C. area. The Center eventually grew to include 22 participants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Tipper_Gore.jpg/200px-Tipper_Gore.jpg
