26.66	Timothy_Garton_Ash	Timothy Garton Ash	Timothy Garton Ash (born 12 July 1955) is a British historian, author and commentator. He is currently serving as Professor of European Studies at Oxford University. Much of his work has been concerned with the late modern and contemporary history of Central and Eastern Europe. He has written about the Communist dictatorships of that region, their experience with the secret police, the Revolutions of 1989 and the transformation of the former Eastern Bloc states into member states of the European Union. He has examined the role of Europe in an increasingly post-Western world and the challenge of combining freedom and diversityâ€”especially in relation to free speech.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Timothy_Garton_Ash_2009.jpg/220px-Timothy_Garton_Ash_2009.jpg
