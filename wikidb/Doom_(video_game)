140.7	Doom_(video_game)	Doom (video game)	Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents) is a 1993 first-person shooter video game by id Software. It is widely recognized for having popularized the first person shooter genre, pioneering immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as "WADs". Its graphic and interactive violence, as well as its Satanic imagery, also made it the subject of considerable controversy. In Doom, players assume the role of a space marine who must fight his way through a military base on Mars' moon, Phobos, and kill the demons from Hell.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Doom_cover_art.jpg
