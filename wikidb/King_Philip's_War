60.1	King_Philip's_War	King Philip's War	King Philip's War, sometimes called the First Indian War, Metacom's War, Metacomet's War, or Metacom's Rebellion, was an armed conflict between Native American inhabitants of present-day New England and English colonists and their Native American allies in 1675â€“78. The war is named after the main leader of the Native American side, Metacomet, known to the English as "King Philip". Major Benjamin Church emerged as the Puritan hero of the war; it was his company of Puritan rangers and Native American allies that finally hunted down and killed King Philip on August 12, 1676. The war continued in northern New England (primarily in Maine at the New England and Acadia border) until a treaty was signed at Casco Bay in April 1678.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Indians_Attacking_a_Garrison_House.jpg/300px-Indians_Attacking_a_Garrison_House.jpg
