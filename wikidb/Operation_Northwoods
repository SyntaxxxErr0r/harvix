156.9	Operation_Northwoods	Operation Northwoods	Operation Northwoods was a series of false-flag proposals that originated in 1962 within the United States government, and which the Kennedy administration rejected. The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or other operatives, to commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities and elsewhere. These acts of terrorism were to be blamed on Cuba in order to create public support for a war against that nation, which had recently become communist under Fidel Castro. One part of Operation Northwoods was to "develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/NorthwoodsMemorandum.jpg/185px-NorthwoodsMemorandum.jpg
