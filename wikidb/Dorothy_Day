56.1	Dorothy_Day	Dorothy Day	Dorothy Day (8 November 1897 â€“ 29 November 1980) was an American journalist, social activist and devout Catholic convert; she advocated the Catholic economic theory of Distributism. She was also considered to be an anarchist, and did not hesitate to use the term. In the 1930s, Day worked closely with fellow activist Peter Maurin to establish the Catholic Worker movement, a nonviolent, pacifist movement that continues to combine direct aid for the poor and homeless with nonviolent direct action on their behalf.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Dorothy_Day_1934.jpg
