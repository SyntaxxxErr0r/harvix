2.00	P%C3%A5skmust	Julmust	Julmust (Swedish jul "Christmas" and must "juice") is a soft drink that is mainly consumed in Sweden around Christmas. During the rest of the year it is usually quite difficult to find in stores, but sometimes it is sold at other times of the year under the name must. At Easter the name is påskmust (påsk "Easter"). The content is the same regardless of the marketing name, although the length of time it is stored before bottling differs; however, the beverage is more closely associated with Christmas, somewhat less with Easter and traditionally not at all with the summer. 45 million litres of julmust are consumed during December (to be compared with roughly 9 million Swedes), which is around 50% of the total soft drink volume in December and 75% of the total yearly must sales.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Apotekarnes_julmust%2C_glasflaska.jpg/150px-Apotekarnes_julmust%2C_glasflaska.jpg
