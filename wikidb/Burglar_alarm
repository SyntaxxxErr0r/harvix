51.6	Burglar_alarm	Burglar alarm	Burglar (or intrusion), alarms are systems designed to detect unauthorized entry into a building or area. They consist of an array of sensors, a control panel and alerting system, and interconnections. Sensors detect intruders by many methods such as monitoring door and window contacts, by passive infrared motion detectors, ultrasound, vibration, electric or magnetic fields, or microwaves. Sensors may be directly wired to a control panel that provides sensor power, or may communicate wirelessly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Honeywell_home_alarm.JPG/220px-Honeywell_home_alarm.JPG
