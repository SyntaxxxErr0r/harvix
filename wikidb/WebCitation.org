2.00	WebCitation.org	WebCite	WebCite is a service that archives web pages on demand. Authors can subsequently cite the archived web pages through WebCite, in addition to citing the original URL of the web page. Readers are able to retrieve the archived web pages indefinitely, without regard to whether the original web page is revised or removed (so-called link rot). Such archiving is especially important in the academic context. WebCite is a non-profit consortium supported by publishers and editors, and it can be used by individual authors and readers without charge. It is a member of International Internet Preservation Consortium.
