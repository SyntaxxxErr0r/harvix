2.00	Sunday_Night_Theatre	Sunday Night Theatre	Sunday Night Theatre was a long-running series of plays created by the BBC first in early 1950, and was regularly shown on Sundays until late 1959, when the last play, A Cup of Kindness, was staged. In 1971, it was re-aired by the BBC, but it was not as successful as the original run was, and was finally laid to rest in mid-1974.
