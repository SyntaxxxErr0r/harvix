282.1	Sustainability	Sustainability	Sustainability is the capacity to endure. For humans, sustainability is the long-term maintenance of responsibility, which has environmental, economic, and social dimensions, and encompasses the concept of stewardship, the responsible management of resource use. In ecology, sustainability describes how biological systems remain diverse and productive over time, a necessary precondition for the well-being of humans and other organisms. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg/220px-BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg
