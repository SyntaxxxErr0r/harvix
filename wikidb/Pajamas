38.27	Pajamas	Pajamas	Traditional pajamas consist of a jacket-and-trousers combination made of soft fabric, such as flannel; the jacket has a placket front and its sleeves have no cuffs. In colloquial speech, these are often called pjs, jim jams or jammies; in South Asia, and sometimes in South Africa, they are known as night suits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/JessiePyjamas.jpg/120px-JessiePyjamas.jpg
