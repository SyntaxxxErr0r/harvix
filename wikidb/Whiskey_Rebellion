81.6	Whiskey_Rebellion	Whiskey Rebellion	The Whiskey Rebellion, or Whiskey Insurrection, was a tax protest in the United States beginning in 1791, during the presidency of George Washington. Farmers who sold their grain in the form of whiskey had to pay a new tax which they strongly resented. The tax was a part of treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton's program to pay off the national debt.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/WhiskeyRebellion.jpg/300px-WhiskeyRebellion.jpg
