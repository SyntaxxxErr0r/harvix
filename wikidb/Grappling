71.7	Grappling	Grappling	Grappling refers to techniques, maneuvers, and counters applied to an opponent in order to gain a physical advantage, such as improving relative position, escaping, submitting, or injury to the opponent. Grappling is a general term that covers techniques used in many disciplines, styles and martial arts that are practiced both as combat sports and for self defense. Grappling does not typically include striking or most commonly the use of weapons, however some grappling disciplines teach tactics that include strikes and weapons either alongside grappling or as part of it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Martial_Arts.jpg/300px-Martial_Arts.jpg
