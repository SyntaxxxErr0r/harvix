1.00	SPS-48	AN/SPS-48	The AN/SPS-48 is a US naval three-dimensional air search radar system manufactured by ITT Exelis. It was a key component of the New Threat Upgrade (NTU) and is still used on some US Navy ships such as Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, Wasp-class amphibious assault ships and Tarawa-class amphibious assault ships. It is the predecessor of the AEGIS system currently in use on Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and Ticonderoga-class cruisers; the AN/SPY-1 phased array radar on cruisers and destroyers, but had been a primary air search sensor for anti-aircraft warfare capable ships. Even today it is capable of handing off target information to shipboard self defense systems such as Sea Sparrow and RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Radar_antennas_on_USS_Theodore_Roosevelt_CVN-71.jpg/250px-Radar_antennas_on_USS_Theodore_Roosevelt_CVN-71.jpg
