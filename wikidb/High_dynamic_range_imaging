461.9	High_dynamic_range_imaging	High dynamic range imaging	In image processing, computer graphics, and photography, high dynamic range imaging is a set of techniques that allows a greater dynamic range between the lightest and darkest areas of an image than current standard digital imaging techniques or photographic methods. This wide dynamic range allows HDR images to represent more accurately the range of intensity levels found in real scenes, ranging from direct sunlight to faint starlight, and is often captured by way of a plurality of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Parque_Balboa_-_San_Diego%2C_California.jpg/250px-Parque_Balboa_-_San_Diego%2C_California.jpg
