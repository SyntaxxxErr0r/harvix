1.00	HOLiC	xxxHolic	×××Holic Horikku), pronounced as "holic," is a Seinen manga written and illustrated by the group of manga authors known as Clamp. The series, which ties in strongly with another of Clamp's series, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, revolves around Kimihiro Watanuki, a high-school student disturbed by his ability to see the supernatural, who meets Yūko Ichihara, a witch who owns a wish-granting shop. Watanuki requests to have his ability to see spirits removed and, as payment, Yūko hires him to work in the shop, resulting in various supernatural encounters. Clamp came with the idea of xxxHolic when wanting to create a series which would link with the others they made.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/XxxHolic_vol1_Cover.jpg
