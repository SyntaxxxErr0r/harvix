1.00	Talk%3AAmorite	Talk:Amorite	Amorite (Egyptian Amurri, Assyrian Amurra or Martu is a term (terms should be in quotes) given by the Israelites to the greatest portion (who else then is involved?) of earlier (earlier? than the arrival of the Hebrews probably) highland mountaineer, or hillmen, descendants of Canaan (Gen. 14:7) who inhabited that land. (is this mythic genealogy or ethography or geography or what?) In early Babylonian inscriptions all western lands including Syria and Palestine, were known as "the land of the Amorites." (this could make a good opening statement, if we knew what "early" means) The Amorites were warlike mountain people. They are represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, (fair skins and blue eyes on "the Egyptian monuments"?) aquiline noses, and pointed beards. (but what are they wearing? but what are they doing? are they prisoners? are they bringing tribute? to whom? Middle Kingdom?) In the Bible, (it's not a book, it's a library) they are supposed (who is doing the supposing? described as? pictured as?) to have been a powerful people of great stature "like the height of the cedars," (good quotes need sources) who had occupied the land east and west of the Jordan river; their king, Og, being described as the last "of the remnant of the giants" (so was the ancestral Canaan a giant?) (Deut. 3:11). What's the actual information here? How does one edit this material? Is anyone else interested? Wetman 03:24, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
