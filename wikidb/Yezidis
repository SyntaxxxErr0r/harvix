6.60	Yezidis	Yazidi	The Yazidi (also Yezidi, Kurdish: ئێزيدي or Êzidî) are mostly Kurdish-speaking people with ancient Indo-Iranian roots, who have their own religion and ethnic identity. They are primarily living in the Mosul region of northern Iraq, with additional communities in Transcaucasia, Armenia, Turkey, and Syria in decline since the 1990s – their members emigrating to Europe, especially to Germany. Their religion, Yazidism, is a branch of Yazdânism, and is seen as a highly syncretic complex of local Kurdish beliefs that contains Zoroastrian elements and Islamic Sufi doctrine introduced to the area by Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir in the 12th century. The Yazidi believe in God as creator of the world, which he placed under the care of seven holy beings or angels, the chief of whom is Melek Taus, the Peacock Angel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/CAEIPDS0.jpg/250px-CAEIPDS0.jpg
