59.6	F-14_Tomcat	Grumman F-14 Tomcat	The Grumman F-14 Tomcat is a supersonic, twin-engine, two-seat, variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft. The Tomcat was developed for the United States Navy's Naval Fighter Experimental (VFX) program following the collapse of the F-111B project. The F-14 was the first of the American teen-series fighters which were designed incorporating the experience of air combat against MiG fighters during the Vietnam War.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/F-14A_Tomcat_over_Iraq_during_Southern_Watch.jpg/300px-F-14A_Tomcat_over_Iraq_during_Southern_Watch.jpg
