1.00	United_States_House_election,_1982	United States House of Representatives elections, 1982	The U.S. House election, 1982 was an election for the United States House of Representatives held on November 2, 1982, in the middle of President Ronald Reagan's first term, whose popularity was sinking due to economic conditions under the 1982 recession. Therefore, the President's Republican Party lost seats in the House. Unlike most midterm election cycles, the number of seats lostâ€”27 seats to the Democratic Party--was a comparatively large swap. It included most of the seats that had been gained the previous election, cementing the Democratic majority.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/SpeakerO%27Neill.jpg/146px-SpeakerO%27Neill.jpg
