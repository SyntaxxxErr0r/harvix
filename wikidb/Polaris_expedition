4.02	Polaris_expedition	Polaris expedition	The Polaris expedition (1871) was led by the American Charles Francis Hall, who intended it to be the first expedition to reach the North Pole. Sponsored by the United States government, it was one of the first serious attempts at the Pole, after that of British naval officer William Edward Parry, who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. The expedition failed at its main objective, having been troubled throughout by insubordination, incompetence, and poor leadership.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Captain_Hall%27s_Arctic_Expedition_--_The_Polaris.jpg/300px-Captain_Hall%27s_Arctic_Expedition_--_The_Polaris.jpg
