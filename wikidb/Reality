108.7	Reality	Reality	In philosophy, reality is the state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may appear or might be imagined. In a wider definition, reality includes everything that is and has been, whether or not it is observable or comprehensible. A still more broad definition includes everything that has existed, exists, or will exist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Virtuality_Continuum_2.jpg/400px-Virtuality_Continuum_2.jpg
