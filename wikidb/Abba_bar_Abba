1.00	Abba_bar_Abba	Abba bar Abba	Abba bar Abba or Father of Samuel was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in Babylonia, known as an amora of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, distinguished for piety, benevolence, and learning. He is known chiefly through his son Samuel of Nehardea, principal of the Academy of Nehardea, and is nearly always referred to as "Samuel's father." Abba traveled to Palestine, where he entered into relations with R. Judah I, the patriarch, with whose pupil Levi bar Sisi he was on terms of intimate friendship. When Levi died Abba delivered the funeral oration and glorified the memory of his friend.
