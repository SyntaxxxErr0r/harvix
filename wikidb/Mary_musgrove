1.00	Mary_musgrove	Mary Musgrove	Mary and Johnny Musgrove in time married and lived amongst her Coweta kin which was the traditional practice of matrilineal cultures such as the Creeks. But in 1725 the couple moved to Pon Pon. By the 1730s they had four sons, but none of their children lived to adulthood. John and Mary owned land in Colleton County and in 1732 they were asked by the Carolina Governor and the Yamacraws, a group of Creeks and Yamasees, to start a trading post near the Savannah River. Their trading post was well established by the time James Oglethorpe (1696â€“1785) and his colonists landed near Georgia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Tomochichi.jpg/220px-Tomochichi.jpg
