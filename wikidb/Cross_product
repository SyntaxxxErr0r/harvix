55.0	Cross_product	Cross product	In mathematics, the cross product, vector product, or Gibbs' vector product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space. It results in a vector which is perpendicular to both of the vectors being multiplied and therefore normal to the plane containing them. It has many applications in mathematics, engineering and physics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cross_product_vector.svg/220px-Cross_product_vector.svg.png
