74.7	Endometriosis	Endometriosis	Endometriosis (from Greek ἔνδον - endon, "within", and μήτρα - mētra, "womb") is a gynecological medical condition in which cells from the lining of the uterus appear and flourish outside the uterine cavity, most commonly on the ovaries. The uterine cavity is lined by endometrial cells, which are under the influence of female hormones. These endometrial-like cells in areas outside the uterus (endometriosis) are influenced by hormonal changes and respond in a way that is similar to the cells found inside the uterus. Symptoms often worsen with the menstrual cycle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Endometriosis.jpg/230px-Endometriosis.jpg
