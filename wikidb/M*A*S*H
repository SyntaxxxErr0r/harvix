30.56	M*A*S*H	M*A*S*H	M*A*S*H is a media franchise. Owned in its film and television incarnations by 20th Century Fox, the series concerns a group of fictional characters who served at the fictional "4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (M*A*S*H)" during the Korean War. The original incarnation of the series is loosely based on the real 8055th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH), and features Hawkeye Pierce as the main character. Later spin-offs involve characters who appeared in the series, but are set after the end of the war. Almost all versions of the series fit into the genre of black comedy or dramedy and involve medicine in a prominent role due to most of the main characters being doctors or nurses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Mash_sign.jpg/220px-Mash_sign.jpg
