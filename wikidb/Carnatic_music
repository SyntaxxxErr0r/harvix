56.3	Carnatic_music	Carnatic music	Carnatic music (Original name Karnāṭaka saṃgīta, Kannada: ಕನಾ೯ಟಕ ಸಂಗೀತ; Tamil: ; Sanskrit: कर्नाटक संगीत; Telugu: కర్ణాటక సంగీతం; Malayalam: കര്‍ണാടക സംഗിതം) is a system of music commonly associated with the southern part of the Indian subcontinent, with its area roughly confined to four modern states of India: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. It is one of two main sub-genres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions; the other sub-genre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian and Islamic influences in North India. In contrast to Hindustani music, the main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gāyaki (singing) style.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/PurandaraStamp.jpg/150px-PurandaraStamp.jpg
