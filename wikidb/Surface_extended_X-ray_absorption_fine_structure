1.00	Surface_extended_X-ray_absorption_fine_structure	Surface extended X-ray absorption fine structure	Surface extended X-ray absorption fine structure is the surface sensitive equivalent of the EXAFS technique. This technique involves the illumination of the sample by high intensity X-ray beams from a synchrotron and monitoring their photoabsorption by detecting in the intensity of Auger electrons as a function of the incident photon energy. Surface sensitivity is achieved by the fact that the interpretation of data depends on the intensity of the Auger electrons (which have an escape depth of ~1â€“2 nm) instead of looking at the relative absorption of the X-rays as in the parent method, EXAFS.
