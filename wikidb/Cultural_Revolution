161.7	Cultural_Revolution	Cultural Revolution	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, commonly known as the Cultural Revolution , was a socio-political movement that took place in the People's Republic of China from 1966 through 1976. Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to enforce socialism in the country by removing capitalist, traditional and cultural elements from Chinese society, and to impose Maoist orthodoxy within the Party. The revolution marked the return of Mao Zedong to a position of absolute power after the failed Great Leap Forward. The movement politically paralyzed the country and significantly affected the country economically and socially.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Cultural_Revolution_poster.jpg/250px-Cultural_Revolution_poster.jpg
