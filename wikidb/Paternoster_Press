2.00	Paternoster_Press	Paternoster Press	Paternoster Press is a British Christian publishing house which was founded by Howard Mudditt in 1936. Mudditt was a Bank of England clerk who decided to move into publishing after seeing the many publishers based on London's Paternoster Row during his lunch hours; the firm was named after the street, rather than being due to any Roman Catholic connections.
