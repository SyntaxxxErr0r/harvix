390.3	Bird	Bird	Birds are feathered, winged, bipedal, endothermic (warm-blooded), egg-laying, vertebrate animals. With around 10,000 living species, they are the most speciose class of tetrapod vertebrates. All present species belong to the subclass Neornithes, and inhabit ecosystems across the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Extant birds range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) Bee Hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) Ostrich. The fossil record indicates that birds emerged within theropod dinosaurs during the Jurassic period, around 160 million years (Ma) ago. Paleontologists regard birds as the only clade of dinosaurs to have survived the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event 65.5 Ma ago.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Monticola_gularis_male_non-breeding_-_Khao_Yai.jpg/220px-Monticola_gularis_male_non-breeding_-_Khao_Yai.jpg
