98.0	Noah_Webster	Noah Webster	Noah Webster, Jr. (October 16, 1758 â€“ May 28, 1843), was a lexicographer, textbook pioneer, English spelling reformer, political writer, editor, and prolific author. He has been called the "Father of American Scholarship and Education." His blue-backed speller books taught five generations of American children how to spell and read, and made their education more secular and less religious. According to Ellis (1979) he gave Americans "a secular catechism to the nation-state." His name became synonymous with "dictionary," especially the modern Merriam-Webster dictionary that was first published in 1828 as An American Dictionary of the English Language.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Noah_Webster_pre-1843_IMG_4412.JPG/225px-Noah_Webster_pre-1843_IMG_4412.JPG
