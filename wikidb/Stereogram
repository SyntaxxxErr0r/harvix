63.8	Stereogram	Stereogram	A stereogram is a pair of two-dimensional panels depicting the view of a scene or an object from the vantage points of the right and left eyes. Observing the panels superimposed in a stereoscope results in the experience of three-dimensionality by virtue of the fact that object depth is encoded as right/left position difference in the panels. Because in a stereoscope one views a representation rather than a real scene, the word illusion is sometimes associated with a stereogram.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Stereo_Pair%2C_Lake_Palanskoye_Landslide%2C_Kamchatka_Peninsula%2C_Russia.jpg/200px-Stereo_Pair%2C_Lake_Palanskoye_Landslide%2C_Kamchatka_Peninsula%2C_Russia.jpg
