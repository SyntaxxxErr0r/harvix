85.1	Albert_Speer	Albert Speer	Speer joined the Nazi Party in 1931, launching him on a political and governmental career which lasted fourteen years. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler commanded him to design and construct a number of structures, including the Reich Chancellery and the Zeppelinfeld stadium in Nuremberg where Party rallies were held. Speer also made plans to reconstruct Berlin on a grand scale, with huge buildings, wide boulevards, and a reorganized transportation system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Albert_Speer_Neurenberg.JPG/220px-Albert_Speer_Neurenberg.JPG
