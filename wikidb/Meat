103.6	Meat	Meat	Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. Most often, this means the skeletal muscle and associated fat and other tissues, but it may also describe other edible tissues such as organs and offal. In commerce, meat is generally used by the meat packing industry in a more restrictive senseâ€”the flesh of mammalian species (pigs, cattle, lambs, etc.) raised and prepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of fish, poultry, and other animals. Usage varies worldwide by culture, and some countries such as India have large populations that avoid the consumption of all or most kinds of meat. Game or bush meat is also generally distinguished from that produced by agriculture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/FoodMeat.jpg/300px-FoodMeat.jpg
