54.4	Stephen_Ambrose	Stephen E. Ambrose	Stephen Edward Ambrose (January 10, 1936 â€“ October 13, 2002) was an American historian and biographer of U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. He was a long time professor of history at the University of New Orleans and the author of many best selling volumes of American popular history. Beginning late in his life and continuing after his death, however, evidence and reports have continued to surface documenting long time patterns of plagiarism, falsification, and inaccuracies in many of his published writings and other work. In response to one of the early reports, Ambrose said he was not "out there stealing other people's writings."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Stephen_Ambrose.JPG
