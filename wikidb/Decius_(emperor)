3.10	Decius_(emperor)	Decius	Decius, who was born at Budalia, now Martinci, Serbia near Sirmium , in Lower Pannonia was one of the first among a long succession of future Roman Emperors to originate from the province of Illyricum in the Danube. Unlike some of his immediate imperial predecessors such as Philip the Arab or Maximinus, Decius was a distinguished senator who had served as consul in 232, had been governor of Moesia and Germania Inferior soon afterwards, served as governor of Hispania Tarraconensis between 235â€“238, and was urban prefect of Rome during the early reign of Emperor Philip the Arab (Marcus Iulius Phillipus).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Emperor_Traianus_Decius_%28Mary_Harrsch%29.jpg/220px-Emperor_Traianus_Decius_%28Mary_Harrsch%29.jpg
