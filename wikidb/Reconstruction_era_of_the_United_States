51.9	Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States	Reconstruction Era of the United States	Reconstruction played out against a backdrop of a once prosperous economy in ruins. The Confederacy in 1861 had 297 towns and cities with a combined population of 835,000; of these, 162 locations with 681,000 total residents were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina; and Richmond, Virginia; these eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. The number of people who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's combined urban and rural populations. In addition, 45 courthouses were burned (out of 830), destroying the documentation for the legal relationships in the affected communities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Broad_Street_Charleston_South_Carolina_1865.jpg/200px-Broad_Street_Charleston_South_Carolina_1865.jpg
