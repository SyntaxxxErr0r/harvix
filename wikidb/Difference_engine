103.9	Difference_engine	Difference engine	A difference engine is an automatic, mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions. The name derives from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial coefficients. Both logarithmic and trigonometric functions, functions commonly used by both navigators and scientists, can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful sets of numbers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Babbage_Difference_Engine.jpg/320px-Babbage_Difference_Engine.jpg
