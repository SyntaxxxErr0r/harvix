157.6	Bradley_Manning	Bradley Manning	Bradley E. Manning (born December 17, 1987) is a United States Army soldier who was arrested in May 2010 in Iraq on suspicion of having disseminated restricted material to the website WikiLeaks. He was charged in July that year with transferring classified data onto his personal computer, and communicating national defense information to an unauthorized source. An additional 22 charges were preferred in March 2011, including "aiding the enemy", a capital offense, though prosecutors said they would not seek the death penalty. He was found fit to face court-martial in April 2011. After the Article 32 hearing in December 2011, the presiding officer recommended that Manning face court-martial. Military District of Washington commander Maj. Gen. Michael Linnington referred all charges to a general court-martial and Manning was formally charged on February 23, 2012.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Bradley_Manning_2_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Bradley_Manning_2_%28cropped%29.jpg
