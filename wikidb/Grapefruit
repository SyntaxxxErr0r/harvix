65.2	Grapefruit	Grapefruit	The grapefruit is a subtropical citrus tree known for its sour fruit, an 18th-century hybrid first bred in Barbados. When found, it was named the "forbidden fruit"; and it has also been misidentified with the pomelo or shaddock (C. maxima), one of the parents of this hybrid, the other being sweet orange (C. Ã— sinensis).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Citrus_paradisi_%28Grapefruit%2C_pink%29_white_bg.jpg/220px-Citrus_paradisi_%28Grapefruit%2C_pink%29_white_bg.jpg
