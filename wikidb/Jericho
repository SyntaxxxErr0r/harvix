64.5	Jericho	Jericho	Described in the Old Testament as the "City of Palm Trees", copious springs in and around Jericho have made it an attractive site for human habitation for thousands of years. It is known in Judeo-Christian tradition as the place of the Israelites' return from bondage in Egypt, led by Joshua, the successor to Moses. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Entering_jericho_south.jpg/250px-Entering_jericho_south.jpg
