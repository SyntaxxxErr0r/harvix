The term "county" is used in 48 of the 50 states; Louisiana is divided into parishes and Alaska into boroughs. Parishes and boroughs are called "county-equivalents" by the U.S. federal government, as are certain independent cities which are not parts of counties. There are currently 3,143 counties and county-equivalents in the United States. There are 3,033 organized county or county-equivalent governments in the United States according to 2007 Census of Governments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/USA_Counties.svg/350px-USA_Counties.svg.png
