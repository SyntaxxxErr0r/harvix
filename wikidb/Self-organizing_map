55.1	Self-organizing_map	Self-organizing map	A self-organizing map or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map. Self-organizing maps are different from other artificial neural networks in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Synapse_Self-Organizing_Map.png/300px-Synapse_Self-Organizing_Map.png
