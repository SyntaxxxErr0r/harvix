Earlier in 1994, the New Zealanders had lost a home series to Pakistan, 2-1, with the reverse swing of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis proving decisive. They also drew a one-off test with India, and split the ODI series with their two opponents evenly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg/100px-Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg.png
