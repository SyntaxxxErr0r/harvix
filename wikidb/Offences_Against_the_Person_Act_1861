3.00	Offences_Against_the_Person_Act_1861	Offences against the Person Act 1861	The Offences against the Person Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict c 100) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It consolidated provisions related to offences against the person (an expression which, in particular, includes offences of violence) from a number of earlier statutes into a single Act. For the most part these provisions were, according to the draftsman of the Act, incorporated with little or no variation in their phraseology. It is one of a group of Acts sometimes referred to as the criminal law consolidation Acts 1861. It was passed with the object of simplifying the law. It is essentially a revised version of an earlier consolidation Act, the Offences against the Person Act 1828 (and the equivalent Irish Act), incorporating subsequent statutes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg/140px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg.png
