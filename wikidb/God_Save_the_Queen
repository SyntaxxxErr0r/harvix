58.0	God_Save_the_Queen	God Save the Queen	"God Save the Queen" (alternatively "God Save the King") is an anthem used in a number of Commonwealth realms, their territories, and the British Crown Dependencies. The words and title are adapted to the gender of the current monarch, eg. replacing "King" with "Queen", "he" with "she", and so forth when a king reigns. It is the de facto British national anthem and of some British territories; it is one of two national anthems for New Zealand (since 1977) and those of Britain's territories that have their own additional local anthem; and the royal anthem of Australia (since 1984), Canada (since 1980), Barbados, Jamaica, and Tuvalu. In countries not previously part of the British Empire, the tune of "God Save the Queen" has also been used as the basis for different patriotic songs, though still generally connected with royal ceremony.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Elizabeth_II_greets_NASA_GSFC_employees%2C_May_8%2C_2007_edit.jpg/220px-Elizabeth_II_greets_NASA_GSFC_employees%2C_May_8%2C_2007_edit.jpg
