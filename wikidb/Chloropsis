1.00	Chloropsis	Leafbird	The leafbirds are a family of small passerine bird species found in India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. They are one of only three bird families that are entirely endemic to the Indomalayan ecozone. They were formerly grouped with the ioras and fairy-bluebirds in the family Irenidae. As presently defined, the leafbird family is monotypic, with all species placed in the genus Chloropsis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Golden_Fronted_Leafbird_Mukulhinge.jpg/240px-Golden_Fronted_Leafbird_Mukulhinge.jpg
