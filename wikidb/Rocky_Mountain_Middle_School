It is in Bonneville Joint School District No. 93 and has grades 7 through 8. It has many different classes and exploratory classes. The building was originally Bonneville High School from 1957 until 1977 when a new building was completed just west of the old one. The old high school then became Bonneville Junior High and later North Bonneville Junior High when a new junior high school was built in Ammon. In 1992 when a second high school Hillcrest was built, 9th grade classes in the district moved to the high schools and 6th grade classes moved from the elementary schools forming Rocky Mountain Middle School.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Rocky_Mountain_Middle_School_%28Idaho_Falls_Idaho%29.JPG/300px-Rocky_Mountain_Middle_School_%28Idaho_Falls_Idaho%29.JPG
