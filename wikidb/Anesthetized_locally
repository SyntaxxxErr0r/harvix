1.00	Anesthetized_locally	Local anesthetic	A local anesthetic is a drug that causes reversible local anesthesia, generally for the aim of having local analgesic effect, that is, inducing absence of pain sensation, although other local senses are often affected as well. Also, when it is used on specific nerve pathways , paralysis (loss of muscle power) can be achieved as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Struktur-Lokalan%C3%A4sthetika.png/220px-Struktur-Lokalan%C3%A4sthetika.png
