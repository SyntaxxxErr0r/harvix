1.00	Esterwegen_concentration_camp	Esterwegen concentration camp	Esterwegen concentration camp (German: KZ Esterwegen) was an "early concentration camp", one of a series of camps first established in the Emsland region of Germany near Papenburg in 1933. Early concentration camps were set up as prison camps for political opponents of the Nazi regime. It was one of 15 camps in the Emsland region and was designated as "Lager VII". In 1941 it became a sub-camp of the concentration camp of Neuengamme. Esterwegen was a "strafgefangenenlager", a camp designed particularly for 'special punishment' primarily for political prisoners and those opposed to the Third Reich.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R31497%2C_KZ_Esterwegen%2C_Rudolf_Diels_vor_H%C3%A4ftlingen.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R31497%2C_KZ_Esterwegen%2C_Rudolf_Diels_vor_H%C3%A4ftlingen.jpg
