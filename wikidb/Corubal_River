1.00	Corubal_River	Corubal River	The Corubal is a river of West Africa, a major tributary of the Geba River. It rises near Labe on the Fouta Djallon plateau of Guinea, enters Guinea-Bissau on its eastern border, then meanders generally southwest, nearing the Guinea-Bissauan border, then turns northwest, passes by Xitole, then empties into the upper end of the Geba estuary. For a short distance, it forms the international border between the two countries.
