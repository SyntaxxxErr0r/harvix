3.30	The_McDades	The McDades	The McDades' musical style is a unique blend of influences that combine the rich cultural experiences they had growing up in Edmonton, Alberta. The three siblings grew up performing a type of Canadiana or music with their parents, Terry McDade and Danielle McDade in The McDade Family Band from 1974 until 1994. As The McDade Family Band the siblings had the chance to perform at such venues as the Canadian National Exhibition, Vancouver Expo 86, The Commonwealth Games and multiple performances for members of British Royal Family. During this time Shannon, Solon, and Jeremiah were exposed to the variety of musical genres that are available in Canada and quickly began to experiment with these sounds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/ShannonJohnson2009.jpg/220px-ShannonJohnson2009.jpg
