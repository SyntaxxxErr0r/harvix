105.6	Yellow_journalism	Yellow journalism	Yellow journalism, or the yellow press, is a type of journalism that presents little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines to sell more newspapers. Techniques may include exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering, or sensationalism. By extension, the term yellow journalism is used today as a pejorative to decry any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical fashion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Puck112188c.jpg/300px-Puck112188c.jpg
