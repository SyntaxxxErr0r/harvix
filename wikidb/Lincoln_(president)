16.01	Lincoln_(president)	Abraham Lincoln	Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th President of the United States, serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. He successfully led his country through a great constitutional, military and moral crisis – the American Civil War – preserving the Union, while ending slavery, and promoting economic and financial modernization. Reared in a poor family on the western frontier, Lincoln was mostly self-educated. He became a country lawyer, an Illinois state legislator, and a one-term member of the United States House of Representatives, but failed in two attempts to be elected to the United States Senate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Abraham_Lincoln_November_1863.jpg/220px-Abraham_Lincoln_November_1863.jpg
