73.6	Power_over_Ethernet	Power over Ethernet	Power over Ethernet or PoE technology describes a system to pass electrical power safely, along with data, on Ethernet cabling. The IEEE standard for PoE requires Category 5 cable or higher for high power levels, but can operate with category 3 cable for low power levels. Power is supplied in common mode over two or more of the differential pairs of wires found in the Ethernet cables and comes from a power supply within a PoE-enabled networking device such as an Ethernet switch or can be injected into a cable run with a midspan power supply.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/PoE_Access_Point_v2.jpg/300px-PoE_Access_Point_v2.jpg
