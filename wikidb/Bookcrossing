12.61	Bookcrossing	BookCrossing	BookCrossing (also: BC, BCing or BXing) is defined as "the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and read by others, who then do likewise." The term is derived from bookcrossing.com, a free online book club which began in order to encourage the practice, aiming to "make the whole world a library."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Bookcrossing.png/255px-Bookcrossing.png
