54.3	Aeron_chair	Aeron chair	The Aeron chair is a Herman Miller product designed in 1994 by Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf. It is an ergonomic chair regarded by many users as inherently very comfortable due to its wide range of fit (available in three sizes) and adjustability. Its novel design has gained it a spot in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection. The chair's exclusivity became a symbol of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, and by 2010 the Aeron chair has become so prevalent that a large number of independent refurbishers and resellers not affiliated with Herman Miller specialize in the Aeron.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Aeron_chair_JN.jpg/220px-Aeron_chair_JN.jpg
