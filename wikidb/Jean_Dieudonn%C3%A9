13.31	Jean_Dieudonn%C3%A9	Jean Dieudonné	Jean Alexandre Eugène Dieudonné (1 July 1906 – 29 November 1992) was a French mathematician, notable for research in abstract algebra and functional analysis, for close involvement with the Nicolas Bourbaki pseudonymous group and the Éléments de géométrie algébrique project of Alexander Grothendieck, and as a historian of mathematics, particularly in the fields of functional analysis and algebraic topology. His work on the classical groups (the book La Géométrie des groupes classiques was published in 1955), and on formal groups, introducing what now are called Dieudonné modules, had a major effect on those fields.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/JeanDieudonn%C3%A9.jpg/220px-JeanDieudonn%C3%A9.jpg
