1.00	Double_Island_Point	Double Island Point	In 1884 a lighthouse was built on the point. It is a timber with metal cladding construction, like many lighthouses in Queensland, made that way because it is cheaper than masonry, but also better suited for soft sandy soils. It was planned for only half way up the point, but then it was realized the light wouldn't be visible to the north and so the tower was built on top of the point. The lantern was initially burning oil, then in 1923 vaporized kerosene was introduced. Later it was converted to electric power. In 1992 it was converted to solar power and demanned. The light characteristic is a single flash every 7.5 seconds, the focal plane is located 96 metres above sea level.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Endeavour_replica_in_Cooktown_harbour.jpg/110px-Endeavour_replica_in_Cooktown_harbour.jpg
