58.6	Antibiotic_resistance	Antibiotic resistance	The widespread use of antibiotics both inside and outside of medicine is playing a significant role in the emergence of resistant bacteria. Although there were low levels of preexisting antibiotic-resistant bacteria before the widespread use of antibiotics, evolutionary pressure from their use has played a role in the development of muiltidrug resistance varieties and the spread of resistance between bacterial species. In some countries, antibiotics are sold over the counter without a prescription, which also leads to the creation of resistant strains. In human medicine, the major problem of the emergence of resistant bacteria is due to misuse and overuse of antibiotics by doctors as well as patients. Other practices contributing towards resistance include the addition of antibiotics to livestock feed. Household use of antibacterials in soaps and other products, although not clearly contributing to resistance, is also discouraged (as not being effective at infection control). Also unsound practices in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry can contribute towards the likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant strains.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Antibiotic_resistance.svg/220px-Antibiotic_resistance.svg.png
