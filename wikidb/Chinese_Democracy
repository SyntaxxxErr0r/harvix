92.7	Chinese_Democracy	Chinese Democracy	Chinese Democracy is the sixth studio album by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, released in November 2008 on Geffen Records. It is the band's first studio album since "The Spaghetti Incident?" (1993), released exactly 15 years before Chinese Democracy, and their first album of original studio material since the simultaneous release of Use Your Illusion I and II in September 1991. Despite debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 and being certified Platinum by the RIAA, Chinese Democracy domestically undersold expectations. It received generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics. The album achieved international chart success and has sold over one million copies in Europe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/GNRchinesedemocracy.jpg/220px-GNRchinesedemocracy.jpg
