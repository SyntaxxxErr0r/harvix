On 26 December 2004, the earthquake, which struck off the northwest coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, generated a tsunami that wreaked havoc along much of the rim of the Indian Ocean. Particularly hard-hit were the countries of India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Nearly 230,000 people were killed, tens of thousands more were injured, and 10 million became homeless and displaced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/US_Navy_050102-N-9593M-088_Sailors%2C_assigned_to_USS_Abraham_Lincoln_%28CVN_72%29_and_embarked_Carrier_Air_Wing_Two_%28CVW-2%29%2C_move_supplies_from_a_truck_in_preparation_for_aerial_resupply_drops_by_SH-60_Seahawk_helicopters.jpg/220px-US_Navy_050102-N-9593M-088_Sailors%2C_assigned_to_USS_Abraham_Lincoln_%28CVN_72%29_and_embarked_Carrier_Air_Wing_Two_%28CVW-2%29%2C_move_supplies_from_a_truck_in_preparation_for_aerial_resupply_drops_by_SH-60_Seahawk_helicopters.jpg
