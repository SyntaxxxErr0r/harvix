73.2	Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming	Polymorphism in object-oriented programming	Subtype polymorphism, almost universally called polymorphism in the context of object-oriented programming, is the ability to create a variable, a function, or an object that has more than one form. The word derives from the Greek "πολυμορφισμός" meaning "having multiple forms". In principle, polymorphism can however arise in other computing contexts and it shares important similarities to the concept of degeneracy in biology.
