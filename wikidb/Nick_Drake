79.1	Nick_Drake	Nick Drake	Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician, known for his sombre guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has gradually achieved wider notice and recognition; today he is widely considered among the most influential English singer-songwriters of the last 50 years. Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20 years old and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums—Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. Drake's reluctance to perform live, or be interviewed, contributed to his lack of commercial success.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/da/Nick_Drake_Promo.jpg
