87.9	Neti_pot	Nasal irrigation	Nasal irrigation or nasal lavage or nasal douche is the personal hygiene practice in which the nasal cavity is washed to flush out excess mucus and debris from the nose and sinuses. Nasal cleansing began as an ayurvedic medicine technique in ancient India. The practice is generally well-tolerated and beneficial with only minor side effects. Nasal irrigation in a wider sense can also refer to the use of saline nasal spray or nebulizers to moisten the mucus membranes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Jalaneti.JPG/230px-Jalaneti.JPG
