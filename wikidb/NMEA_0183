54.0	NMEA_0183	NMEA 0183	NMEA 0183 is a combined electrical and data specification for communication between marine electronic devices such as echo sounder, sonars, anemometer, gyrocompass, autopilot, GPS receivers and many other types of instruments. It has been defined by, and is controlled by, the U.S.-based National Marine Electronics Association. It replaces the earlier NMEA 0180 and NMEA 0182 standards. In marine applications it is slowly being phased out in favor of the newer NMEA 2000 standard.
