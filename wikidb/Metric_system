119.5	Metric_system	Metric system	The metric system is an international decimalised system of measurement that was originally based on the m√®tre des archives and the kilogramme des archives introduced by France in 1799. Over the years the definitions of the metre and kilogram have been refined and the metric system extended to incorporate many more units. Although a number of variants of the metric system emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the term is now often used as a synonym for the "International System of Units" - the official system of measurement in almost every country in the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/FourMetricInstruments.JPG/280px-FourMetricInstruments.JPG
