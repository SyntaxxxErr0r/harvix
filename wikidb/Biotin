56.6	Biotin	Biotin	Biotin, also known as Vitamin H or Coenzyme R, is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin (vitamin B7). It is composed of a ureido (tetrahydroimidizalone) ring fused with a tetrahydrothiophene ring. A valeric acid substituent is attached to one of the carbon atoms of the tetrahydrothiophene ring. Biotin is a coenzyme in the synthesis of fatty acids, isoleucine, and valine, and it plays a role in gluconeogenesis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Biotin_structure_JA.png/200px-Biotin_structure_JA.png
