3.00	Rogers_and_hammerstein	Rodgers and Hammerstein	Richard Rodgers (1902 – 1979) and Oscar Hammerstein II (1895 – 1960) were a well-known American songwriting duo, usually referred to as Rodgers and Hammerstein. They created a string of popular Broadway musicals in the 1940s and 1950s during what is considered the golden age of the medium. With Rodgers composing the music and Hammerstein writing the lyrics, five of their shows, Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music, were outstanding successes. In all, among the many accolades that their shows (and their film versions) garnered were thirty-four Tony Awards, fifteen Academy Awards, the Pulitzer Prize, and two Grammys.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Rodgers_and_Hammerstein_and_Berlin_and_Tamiris_NYWTS.jpg/300px-Rodgers_and_Hammerstein_and_Berlin_and_Tamiris_NYWTS.jpg
