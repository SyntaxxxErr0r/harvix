71.8	Freedom_of_religion	Freedom of religion	Freedom of religion is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance; the concept is generally recognized also to include the freedom to change religion or not to follow any religion. The freedom to leave or discontinue membership in a religion or religious group —in religious terms called "apostasy" —is also a fundamental part of religious freedom, covered by Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Minerva_als_Symbol_der_Toleranz.jpg/150px-Minerva_als_Symbol_der_Toleranz.jpg
