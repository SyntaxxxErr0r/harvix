7.63	1984_(1956_film)	1984 (1956 film)	1984 is a 1956 film loosely based on the novel of the same name by George Orwell. This is the first cinema rendition of the story, directed by Michael Anderson, and starring Edmond O'Brien. Also starring are Donald Pleasence, Jan Sterling, and Michael Redgrave. Pleasence also appeared in the 1954 television version of the film, playing the character of Syme, which in the film was amalgamated with that of Parsons. O'Brien, the antagonist, was renamed "O'Connor," possibly to avoid confusion with lead actor Edmond O'Brien. The plot was substantially different from the book, ending with the start of the downfall of the Party. After the customary distributor agreement expired, the film was withdrawn from the theatrical and TV distribution channels by Orwell's estate, and is no longer available in any legally obtainable format, although a few prints are in the hands of collectors and clips have surfaced on YouTube.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a7/1984film.jpg/220px-1984film.jpg
