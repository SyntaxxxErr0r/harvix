145.7	Ion	Ion	An ion is an atom or molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge. The name was given by physicist Michael Faraday for the substances that allow a current to pass ("go") between electrodes in a solution, when an electric field is applied. It is the transliteration of the Greek participle ἰόν, ión, "going".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Ions.svg/390px-Ions.svg.png
