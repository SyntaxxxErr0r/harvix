63.5	Windows_Movie_Maker	Windows Movie Maker	Windows Movie Maker is a video creating/editing software application, included in Microsoft Windows Me, XP, and Vista. It contains features such as effects, transitions, titles/credits, audio track, timeline narration, and Auto Movie. New effects and transitions can be made and existing ones can be modified using XML code. Windows Movie Maker is also a basic audio track editing program. It can apply basic effects to audio tracks such as fade in or fade out. The audio tracks can then be exported in the form of a sound file instead of a video file.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Windows_Movie_Maker.png/300px-Windows_Movie_Maker.png
