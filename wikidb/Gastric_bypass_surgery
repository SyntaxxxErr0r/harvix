83.4	Gastric_bypass_surgery	Gastric bypass surgery	Gastric bypass procedures (GBP) are any of a group of similar operations that first divides the stomach into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower "remnant" pouch and then re-arranges the small intestine to connect to both. Surgeons have developed several different ways to reconnect the intestine, thus leading to several different GBP names. Any GBP leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Gastric_Bypass%2C_Roux_en-Y.jpg
