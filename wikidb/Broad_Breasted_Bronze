2.00	Broad_Breasted_Bronze	Bronze (turkey)	The Bronze is a breed of domestic turkey. The name refers to its plumage, which bears an iridescent bronze-like sheen. The Bronze had been the most popular turkey throughout most of American history, but waned in popularity beginning in the mid-20th century. Later in its history, the breed was divided into two distinct types: the Broad Breasted Bronze and the Standard Bronze. A great deal of confusion exists about the difference between Standard and Broad Breasted Bronzes, or that there is any difference at all. Collectively, the Standard and Broad Breasted varieties are simply called the Bronze turkey.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Male_north_american_turkey_supersaturated.jpg/250px-Male_north_american_turkey_supersaturated.jpg
