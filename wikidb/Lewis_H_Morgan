1.00	Lewis_H_Morgan	Lewis H. Morgan	Lewis Henry Morgan (November 21, 1818 â€“ December 17, 1881) was a pioneering American anthropologist and social theorist, a railroad lawyer and capitalist. He is best known for his work on kinship and social structure, his theories of social evolution, and his ethnography of the Iroquois. Interested in what holds societies together, he proposed the concept that the earliest human domestic institution was the matrilineal clan, not the patriarchal family; the idea was accepted by most pre-historians and anthropologists throughout the late nineteenth century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Lewishenrymorgan.jpg/200px-Lewishenrymorgan.jpg
