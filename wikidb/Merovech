13.40	Merovech	Merovech	Merovech (c. 415-457) is the semi-legendary founder of the Merovingian dynasty of the Salian Franks (although Chlodio may in fact be the founder), which later became the dominant Frankish tribe. He allegedly lived in the first half of the fifth century. His name is a Latinization of a form close to the Old High German given name Marwig, lit. "famed fight" (cf. māri "famous" + wīg "fight") compare modern Dutch mare "renowned" and vecht "fight". The first Frankish royal dynasty called themselves Merovingians ("descendants of Meroveus") after him.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Victory_of_King_Merovech.png/220px-Victory_of_King_Merovech.png
