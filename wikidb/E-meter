60.0	E-meter	E-meter	An E-meter is an electronic device used during Dianetics and Scientology auditing. The device is a variation of a Wheatstone bridge, which measures electrical resistance and skin conductance. It is formally known as the Hubbard Electrometer, for the Church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard. Most of the Scientology concepts associated with the "E-meter" and its use are regarded by the scientific and medical communities as pseudoscience and the device itself is essentially a modified ohmmeter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Scientology_e_meter_blue.jpg/300px-Scientology_e_meter_blue.jpg
