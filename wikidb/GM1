3.10	GM1	GM1	GM1 (monosialotetrahexosylganglioside) the "prototype" ganglioside, is a member of the ganglio series of gangliosides which contain one sialic acid residue. GM1 has important physiological properties and impacts neuronal plasticity and repair mechanisms, and the release of neurotrophins in the brain. Besides its function in the physiology of the brain, GM1 acts as the site of binding for both Cholera toxin and E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/GM1_ganglioside.png/250px-GM1_ganglioside.png
