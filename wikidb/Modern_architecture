60.4	Modern_architecture	Modern architecture	Modern architecture is generally characterized by simplification of form and creation of ornament from the structure and theme of the building. It is a term applied to an overarching movement, with its exact definition and scope varying widely. In a broader sense, early modern architecture began at the turn of the 20th century with efforts to reconcile the principles underlying architectural design with rapid technological advancement and the modernization of society. It would take the form of numerous movements, schools of design, and architectural styles, some in tension with one another, and often equally defying such classification.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/2006-06-05_1580x2900_chicago_modernism.jpg/220px-2006-06-05_1580x2900_chicago_modernism.jpg
