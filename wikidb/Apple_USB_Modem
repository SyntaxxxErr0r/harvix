3.31	Apple_USB_Modem	Apple Modem	The Apple USB Modem was a combined 56 kbit/s data modem and 14.4 kbit/s fax external USB modem introduced by Apple Inc. after the internal 56k modem was dropped on the October 12, 2005 iMac G5 revision. While it looks identical, it's not to be confused with Apple's optional USB Ethernet Adapter accessory, available for its MacBook Air range of laptops since 2008.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Apple-usb-modem.jpg
