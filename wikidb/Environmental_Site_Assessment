2.02	Environmental_Site_Assessment	Phase I environmental site assessment	In the United States, an environmental site assessment is a report prepared for a real estate holding which identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. The analysis, often called an ESA, typically addresses both the underlying land as well as physical improvements to the property. A proportion of contaminated sites are "brownfield sites." In severe cases, brownfield sites may be added to the National Priorities List where they will be subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund program.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Air_.pollution_1.jpg/260px-Air_.pollution_1.jpg
