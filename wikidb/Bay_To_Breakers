7.30	Bay_To_Breakers	Bay to Breakers	The Bay to Breakers is an annual footrace which takes place in San Francisco, California on the third Sunday of May. The name reflects the fact that the race starts at the northeast end of the downtown area a few blocks from The Embarcadero (adjacent to San Francisco Bay) and runs west through the city to finish at the Great Highway (adjacent to the Pacific coast, where breakers crash onto Ocean Beach). The complete course is 7.46 miles (12.01 km) long. The event is well-known for many participants wearing costumes, and a few engaging in varying degrees of public nudity. The event was officially the world's largest footrace from 1986 (with 110,000 participants) until it was surpassed in 2010.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/2010_05_16_Bay_2_Breakers_pink_gorilla.jpg/250px-2010_05_16_Bay_2_Breakers_pink_gorilla.jpg
