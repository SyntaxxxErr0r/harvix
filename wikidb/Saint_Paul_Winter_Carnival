Offended by this attack on their Capital City, the Saint Paul Chamber of Commerce decided to prove not only that Saint Paul was habitable but that its citizens were very much alive during winter, the most dominant season. Thus was born the Saint Paul Winter Carnival. The first carnivals were held 1886-1888 and 1896. They were revived in 1916 and 1917. Beginning again in 1937, they continued through 1942, resuming on a permanent basis in 1946.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/2004_Winter_Carnival_Ice_Castle_%28night%29.jpg/220px-2004_Winter_Carnival_Ice_Castle_%28night%29.jpg
