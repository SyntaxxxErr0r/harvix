89.0	Homunculus	Homunculus	Homunculus (masculine, Latin for "little human", plural: "homunculi"; from the diminutive of homo) is a term used, generally, in various fields of study to refer to any representation of a human being. Throughout history, it has been referred specifically to the concept of a miniature though fully formed human body, for example, in the studies of alchemy and preformationism. In current context, in scientific fields, a homunculus may refer to any scale model of the human body that, in some way, illustrates physiological, psychological, or other abstract human characteristics or functions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Preformation.GIF/170px-Preformation.GIF
