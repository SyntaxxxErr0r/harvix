He actively supported the French Revolution and adopted the name Philippe Égalité, but was nonetheless guillotined during the Reign of Terror. His son Louis-Philippe became King of the French after the July Revolution of 1830. Following his career, the term Orléanist came to be attached to the movement in France that favoured constitutional monarchy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Louis_Philippe_Joseph%2C_Duc_d%27Orleans_and_Duc_de_Chartres_by_Louis_Tocqu%C3%A9.jpg/220px-Louis_Philippe_Joseph%2C_Duc_d%27Orleans_and_Duc_de_Chartres_by_Louis_Tocqu%C3%A9.jpg
