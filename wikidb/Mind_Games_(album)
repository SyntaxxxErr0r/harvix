2.00	Mind_Games_(album)	Mind Games	Mind Games is John Lennon's fourth post-Beatles album, and was recorded and released in 1973. Like his previous album, the politically topical and somewhat abrasive Some Time in New York City, Mind Games was poorly received by music critics. It reached #13 in the UK and #9 in the US, where it went gold.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/JohnLennon-albums-mindgames.jpg/220px-JohnLennon-albums-mindgames.jpg
