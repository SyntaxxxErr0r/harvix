13.30	Miraflores_(Panama)	Miraflores (Panama)	Miraflores is the name of one of the three locks that form part of the Panama Canal and the name of the small lake that separates these locks from the Pedro Miguel locks upstream. In the Miraflores locks, vessels are lifted (or lowered) in three stages totalling 8 m, allowing them to transit to or from the Pacific Ocean port of Balboa (near Panama City). Ships cross below the Puente de las Am√©ricas which connects North and South America.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Ship_passing_through_Panama_Canal_01.jpg/220px-Ship_passing_through_Panama_Canal_01.jpg
