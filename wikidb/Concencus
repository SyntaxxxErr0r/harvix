1.00	Concencus	Consensus decision-making	Consensus decision-making is a group decision making process that seeks the consent, not necessarily the agreement of participants and the resolution of objections. Consensus is defined by Merriam-Webster as, first, general agreement, and second, group solidarity of belief or sentiment. It has its origin in a Latin word meaning literally feel together. It is used to describe both the decision and the process of reaching a decision. Consensus decision-making is thus concerned with the process of reaching a consensus decision, and the social and political effects of using this process.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Consensus-flowchart.png/250px-Consensus-flowchart.png
