1.00	Debris_disks	Debris disk	A debris disk is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star. Sometimes these disks contain prominent rings, as seen in the image of Fomalhaut on the right. Debris disks have been found around both evolved and young stars, as well as at least one debris disk in orbit around a neutron star. They can constitute a phase in the formation of a planetary system following the protoplanetary disk phase. They can also be produced and maintained as the remnants of collisions between planetismals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Fomalhaut_with_Disk_Ring_and_extrasolar_planet_b.jpg/300px-Fomalhaut_with_Disk_Ring_and_extrasolar_planet_b.jpg
