132.7	Terri_Schiavo	Terri Schiavo case	The Terri Schiavo case ( ) was a legal battle involving prolonged life support in the United States that lasted from 1998 to 2005. At issue was whether the husband of Teresa Marie "Terri" Schiavo had the right to terminate life support for his wife, who was diagnosed by doctors as being in a persistent vegetative state. The highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges presented by her parents and by state and federal legislative intervention effected a seven-year delay before life support finally was terminated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/39/Schiavo.jpg/220px-Schiavo.jpg
