4.30	Wild_knot	Wild knot	In the mathematical theory of knots, a knot is tame if it can be "thickened up", that is, if there exists an extension to an embedding of the solid torus S 1 Ã— D 2 into the 3-sphere. A knot is tame if and only if it can be represented as a finite closed polygonal chain. Knots that are not tame are called wild and can have pathological behavior. In knot theory and 3-manifold theory, often the adjective "tame" is omitted. Smooth knots, for example, are always tame.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Wild_knot.svg/200px-Wild_knot.svg.png
