It is in some respects similar to the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) trade association's Children's Machine (XO), which has a similar target market. Although made for profit, the production of the Classmate PC is considered an Information and Communication Technologies for Development project. The device falls into the newly defined category of netbooks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Intel_Classmate_PC.jpg/262px-Intel_Classmate_PC.jpg
