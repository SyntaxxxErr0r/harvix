The song set consists of 22 chapters, which were released from 2005 to 2007. The first five chapters of the set are included on his seventh studio album TP.3 Reloaded, with the first chapter being released as the first single from the album. Written and produced by Kelly, the series tells a story of a one-night stand that sets off a chain of events, which gradually reveals a greater web of lies, sex and deceit. Musically, all chapters of the song feature the same melodic theme with varying lyrics, relating an ongoing narrative.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/10/R_kelly_in_the_kitchen.jpg/220px-R_kelly_in_the_kitchen.jpg
