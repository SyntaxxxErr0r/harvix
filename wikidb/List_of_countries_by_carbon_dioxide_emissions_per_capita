117.0	List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita	List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita	This is a list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita from 1990 through 2008. All data were calculated by the US Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), mostly based on data collected from country agencies by the United Nations Statistics Division. Countries are ranked by their metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per capita in 2008. The data only considers carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but not emissions from land use such as deforestation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/CO2_per_capita_per_country.png/220px-CO2_per_capita_per_country.png
