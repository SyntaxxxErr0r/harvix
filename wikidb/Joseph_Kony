68.7	Joseph_Kony	Joseph Kony	Joseph Rao Kony is the head of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a Ugandan guerrilla group. While initially enjoying strong public support, the LRA turned on its own supporters, supposedly to "purify" the Acholi people and turn Uganda into a theocracy. Kony proclaims himself the spokesperson of God and a spirit medium, has nurtured a cult of personality, and claims he is visited by a multinational host of 13 spirits, including a Chinese phantom. Ideologically, the group is a syncretic mix of mysticism, Acholi nationalism, and Christian fundamentalism, and claims to be establishing a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments and local Acholi tradition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Ugandan_districts_affected_by_Lords_Resistance_Army.png/150px-Ugandan_districts_affected_by_Lords_Resistance_Army.png
