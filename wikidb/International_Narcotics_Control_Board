18.30	International_Narcotics_Control_Board	International Narcotics Control Board	There is widespread criticism over the existence of International Narcotics Control Board and its "requirements" for nations to comply with their drug laws. It is often thought that the UN is overstepping its role as an international organization and trying instead to act more like an international government. Critics often point out that UN is eroding the sovereignty of states to choose whether or not they will criminalize drugs. Those against the war on drugs and drug prohibition in general often blame UN's involvement with regulating drugs as a strong reason why there is worldwide prohibition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Emblem_of_the_United_Nations.svg/150px-Emblem_of_the_United_Nations.svg.png
