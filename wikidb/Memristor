74.0	Memristor	Memristor	Memristor (a portmanteau of "memory resistor") is a passive two-terminal electrical component envisioned as a fundamental non-linear circuit element relating charge and magnetic flux linkage. The memristor is currently under development by a team at Hewlett-Packard. In March 2012 a team of researchers from HRL Laboratories and the University of Michigan announced the first functioning memristor array built on a CMOS chip for applications in neuromorphic synapses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Memristor.jpg/225px-Memristor.jpg
