67.6	Solar_wind	Solar wind	The solar wind is a stream of charged particles ejected from the upper atmosphere of the Sun. It mostly consists of electrons and protons with energies usually between 1.5 and 10 keV. The stream of particles varies in temperature and speed over time. These particles can escape the Sun's gravity because of their high kinetic energy and the high temperature of the corona.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bd/Birkeland-anode-globe-fig259.jpg/250px-Birkeland-anode-globe-fig259.jpg
