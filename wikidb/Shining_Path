55.5	Shining_Path	Shining Path	Shining Path is a Maoist guerrilla insurgent organization in Peru. It prefers to be called the "Communist Party of Peru" or "PCP" for short (see Communism in Peru). The Shining Path initiated the internal conflict in Peru in 1980, with the stated goal of replacing what it referred to as a bourgeois democracy with "New Democracy". The Shining Path believed that by imposing a dictatorship of the proletariat, inducing cultural revolution, and eventually sparking world revolution, they could arrive at pure communism. Their representatives said that existing socialist countries were revisionist, and claimed to be the vanguard of the world communist movement. The Shining Path's ideology and tactics have been influential on other Maoist insurgent groups, notably the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and other Revolutionary Internationalist Movement-affiliated organizations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Flag_of_Sendero_Luminoso.svg/240px-Flag_of_Sendero_Luminoso.svg.png
