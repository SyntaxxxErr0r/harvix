171.2	Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States	Founding Fathers of the United States	The Founding Fathers of the United States of America were political leaders and statesmen who participated in the American Revolution by creating the United States Declaration of Independence, taking part in the American Revolutionary War, establishing the United States Constitution, or by some other key contribution. Within the large group known as the "Founding Fathers", there are two key subsets: the "Signers of the Declaration of Independence" (who signed the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776) and the Framers of the Constitution (who were delegates to the Federal Convention and took part in framing or drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States). A further subset is the group that signed the Articles of Confederation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Declaration_independence.jpg/300px-Declaration_independence.jpg
