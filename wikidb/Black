98.9	Black	Black	Black is the color of objects that do not emit or reflect light in any part of the visible spectrum; they absorb all such frequencies of light. Although black is sometimes described as an "achromatic", or hueless, color, in practice it can be considered a color, as in expressions like "black cat" or "black paint".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Solid_black.svg/250px-Solid_black.svg.png
