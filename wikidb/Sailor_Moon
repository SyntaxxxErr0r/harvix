84.9	Sailor_Moon	Sailor Moon	Sailor Moon, known in Japan as Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon Bishōjo Senshi Sērā Mūn, officially translated Pretty Soldier Sailormoon or Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon), is a media franchise created by manga artist Naoko Takeuchi. Fred Patten credits Takeuchi with popularizing the concept of a team of magical girls, and Paul Gravett credits the series with "revitalizing" the magical-girl genre itself. Sailor Moon redefined the magical-girl genre, as previous magical girls did not use their powers to fight evil, but this has become one of the standard archetypes of the genre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/SMVolume1.jpg
