3.00	Chrysler_Norseman	Chrysler Norseman	The Chrysler Norseman was a concept car built in 1956. It was a four-seat coupe. Although designed by Chrysler Corporation's stylists, actual construction was contracted out to the Italian coach-building firm of Ghia. Ghia had experience in the construction of low-volume vehicles and one-off prototypes, having built the successful Lincoln Futura concept the previous year. It took Ghia's craftsmen over a year to build the complex Norseman.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/1956_chrysler_norseman_concept.jpg/220px-1956_chrysler_norseman_concept.jpg
