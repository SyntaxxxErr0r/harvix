The name "Big Sur" is derived from the original Spanish-language "el sur grande", meaning "the big south", or from "el pa√≠s grande del sur", "the big country of the south". The terrain offers stunning views, making Big Sur a popular tourist destination. Big Sur's Cone Peak is the highest coastal mountain in the contiguous 48 states, ascending nearly a mile (5,155 feet/1571 m) above sea level, only three miles (4.8 km) from the ocean.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Big_Sur_June_2008.jpg/250px-Big_Sur_June_2008.jpg
