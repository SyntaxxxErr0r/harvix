2.10	Sceaf	Sceafa	Sceafa or Scef (scÄ“f), was an ancient Lombardic king in English legend. According to his story, Sceafa appeared mysteriously as a child, coming out of the sea in an empty boat. The name also appears in the corrupt forms Seskef, Stefius, Strephius, and Stresaeus. Though the name has historically been modernized Shava (and Latinized Scefius), J. R. R. Tolkien used the modern spelling Sheave.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Gossen_i_b%C3%A5ten.jpg/300px-Gossen_i_b%C3%A5ten.jpg
