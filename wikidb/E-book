195.8	E-book	E-book	An electronic book (variously, e-book, ebook, digital book) is a book-length publication in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, and produced on, published through, and readable on computers or other electronic devices. Sometimes the equivalent of a conventional printed book, e-books can also be born digital. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines the e-book as "an electronic version of a printed book," but e-books can and do exist without any printed equivalent. E-books are usually read on dedicated e-book readers. Personal computers and some mobile phones can also be used to read e-books.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Amazon_Kindle_3.JPG/220px-Amazon_Kindle_3.JPG
