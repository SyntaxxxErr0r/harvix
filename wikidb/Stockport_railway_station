3.40	Stockport_railway_station	Stockport railway station	Stockport railway station (also known as Stockport Edgeley and Edgeley) is in Greater Manchester, England, 8 miles south-east of Manchester Piccadilly station on the West Coast Main Line from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston. It was opened on 15 February 1843 by the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, following completion of the large railway viaduct just to its north. After operation by the London &amp; North Western Railway, it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, who renamed it Stockport Edgeley, to differentiate it from Stockport Tiviot Dale, which closed in 1967. It is high above the valley of the river Mersey in which Stockport lies, and is linked to both central Stockport and Edgeley by a pedestrian underpass. In 2009 the station was identified as one of the ten worst category B interchange stations for mystery shopper assessment of fabric and environment, and is set to receive a share of Â£50m funding for improvements. Some improvements to the station have begun, with changes to the signs to make them clearer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Stockportbigsign999.jpg/265px-Stockportbigsign999.jpg
