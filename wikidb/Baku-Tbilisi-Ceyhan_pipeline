It connects Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan; Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia; and Ceyhan, a port on the south-eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey, hence its name. It is the second longest oil pipeline in the former Soviet Union after the Druzhba pipeline. The first oil that was pumped from the Baku end of the pipeline on 10 May 2005 reached Ceyhan on 28 May 2006.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Baku_pipelines.svg/220px-Baku_pipelines.svg.png
