66.8	Cuneiform_script	Cuneiform	Cuneiform script is one of the earliest known forms of written expression. Emerging in Sumer around the 30th century BC, with predecessors reaching into the late 4th millennium (the Uruk IV period), cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs. In the three millennia the script spanned, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use also grew gradually smaller, from about 1,000 unique characters in the Early Bronze Age to about 400 unique characters in Late Bronze Age .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Sumerian_26th_c_Adab.jpg/310px-Sumerian_26th_c_Adab.jpg
