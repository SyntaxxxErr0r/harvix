54.4	First_aid	First aid	First aid is the provision of initial care for an illness or injury. It is usually performed by non-expert, but trained personnel to a sick or injured person until definitive medical treatment can be accessed. Certain self-limiting illnesses or minor injuries may not require further medical care past the first aid intervention. It generally consists of a series of simple and in some cases, potentially life-saving techniques that an individual can be trained to perform with minimal equipment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/US_Navy_030322-M-6270B-010_A_U.S._Navy_Corpsman_assigned_to_the_15th_Marine_Expeditionary_Unit_%28Special_Operations_Capable%29_gives_first_aid_to_an_injured_Iraqi_citizen.jpg/220px-US_Navy_030322-M-6270B-010_A_U.S._Navy_Corpsman_assigned_to_the_15th_Marine_Expeditionary_Unit_%28Special_Operations_Capable%29_gives_first_aid_to_an_injured_Iraqi_citizen.jpg
