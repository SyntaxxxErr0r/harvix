There is a broad range of styles, from bluegrass, to yodelling to folk to the more popular. The genre has been influenced by Celtic and English folk music, by the traditions of Australian bush balladeers, as well as by popular American country music. Themes include: outback life, the lives of stockmen, truckers and outlaws, songs of romance and of political protest; and songs about the "beauty and the terror" of the Australian bush.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Tom_Roberts_-_Shearing_the_Rams.jpg/220px-Tom_Roberts_-_Shearing_the_Rams.jpg
