1.00	BuddyCast	BuddyCast	BuddyCast is an open peer-to-peer protocol for distributing streaming content to an unlimited number of users by turning broadcast receivers into stream relays, or “buddies.” Developed by Mel Beckman, Denison Bollay, and Brian Fox, the protocol maintains resilience through the use of standby redundant buddies to replace buddies that leave the network. Broadcast distribution is controlled by a Buddycast Multicast Controller (MC), which hands off inbound requests for streams to available buddies and monitors the state of relayed streams. To this end, the MC maintains a network topology map, which the MC can exploit to improve performance and minimize the number redundant inter-network streams.
