109.1	Dynamic_programming	Dynamic programming	In mathematics and computer science, dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems which are only slightly smaller and optimal substructure (described below). When applicable, the method takes far less time than naive methods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Shortest_path_optimal_substructure.png
