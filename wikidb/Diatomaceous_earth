82.1	Diatomaceous_earth	Diatomaceous earth	Diatomaceous earth ( ) also known as diatomite or kieselgur/kieselguhr, is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that is easily crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It has a particle size ranging from less than 1 micrometre to more than 1 millimetre, but typically 10 to 200 micrometres. This powder has an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and is very light as a result of its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven-dried diatomaceous earth is 80 to 90% silica, with 2 to 4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals) and 0.5 to 2% iron oxide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Mineraly.sk_-_diatomit.jpg/250px-Mineraly.sk_-_diatomit.jpg
