1.20	Hybrid_species	Hybrid speciation	Hybrid speciation is a form of speciation wherein hybridization between two different closely related species leads to a novel species, reproductively isolated from the parent species. From the 1940s, reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents was thought to be particularly difficult to achieve and thus hybrid species considered to be extremely rare. With DNA analysis becoming more accessible in the 1990s, hybrid species have been showed to be a fairly common phenomenon, particularly in plants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/220px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png
