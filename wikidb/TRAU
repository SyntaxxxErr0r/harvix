1.00	TRAU	TRAU	Transcoder and Rate Adaptation Unit, or TRAU, performs transcoding function for speech channels and RA (Rate Adaptation) for data channels in the GSM network. The Transcoder/Rate Adaptation Unit (TRAU) is the data rate conversion unit. The PSTN/ISDN switch is a switch for 64 kbps voice. Current technology permits to decrease the bit-rate (in GSM radio interface it is 13 kbps for full rate and 6.5 kbps for half rate). Since MSC is basically a PSTN/ISDN switch its bit-rate is still 64 kbps. That is why a rate conversion is required in between the BSC and MSC
