81.6	Modafinil	Modafinil	Modafinil is an analeptic drug invented in France in Lafon Laboratories, bought by American firm Cephalon in 2001. Modafinil has initially been developed by french neurophysiologist, emeritus experimental medicine professor Michel Jouvet. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Because of the risk for development of skin or hypersensitivity reactions and neuropsychiatric disorders, the European Medicines Agency has recommended that new patient prescriptions should only be to treat sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Because serious side effects will usually, if at all, appear within the first 12 weeks the guidance did not require patients already receiving treatment to stop.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Modafinil.svg/220px-Modafinil.svg.png
