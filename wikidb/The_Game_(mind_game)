75.4	The_Game_(mind_game)	The Game (mind game)	The Game is a mental game where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself. Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which, according to the rules of The Game, must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win most versions of The Game; players can only attempt to avoid losing for as long as they possibly can. The Game has been variously described as pointless and infuriating, or as challenging and fun to play. As of 2010, The Game is played by millions worldwide, although in theory, the whole world is playing it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/I_lost_the_game.jpg/200px-I_lost_the_game.jpg
