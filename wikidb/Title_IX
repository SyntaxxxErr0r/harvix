103.6	Title_IX	Title IX	Although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written in order to end discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, the act also energized the women's rights movement, which had somewhat slowed after women's suffrage in 1920. While Title IX is best known for its impact on high school and collegiate athletics, the original statute made no explicit mention of sports.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Patsymink.jpg/220px-Patsymink.jpg
