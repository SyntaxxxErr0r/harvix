1.01	Squats_(Warhammer_40,000)	Squat (Warhammer 40,000)	In the fictional universe of Warhammer 40,000, the Squats are a dwarf-like race descended from the humans that colonised high gravity worlds. Separated from the rest of humanity over the millennia they evolved their own distinct morphology and culture. Squats were discontinued from the game in the 90s by Games Workshop though their existence remains somewhat canon. Their omission from the game was explained by a Tyranid invasion of their Home Worlds wiping them out almost to a man. The survivors were then assimilated into the Imperium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/33/Squat-command.jpg/220px-Squat-command.jpg
