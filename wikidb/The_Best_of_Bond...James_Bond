1.00	The_Best_of_Bond...James_Bond	The Best of Bond...James Bond	The Best of Bond...James Bond is a title used more than once for a compilation album of the soundtracks to the James Bond made at the time. It was originally released in 1992 as The Best of James Bond, as a one-disc compilation and a two-disc 30th Anniversary Limited Edition compilation with songs that had, at that point, never been released to the public. The single disc compilation was updated in 1999 and later again in 2002 and then again in 2008. The 2008 version was augmented with the addition of a DVD featuring music videos and a documentary.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/BestofBondJamesBondcd.jpg/220px-BestofBondJamesBondcd.jpg
