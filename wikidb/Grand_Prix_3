7.31	Grand_Prix_3	Grand Prix 3	Grand Prix 3 (GP3) is a computer racing simulator by MicroProse. Released in 2000 by Hasbro Interactive featuring the 1998 Formula One season (with all drivers except Jacques Villeneuve, who is instead replaced by a fictional character, John Newhouse). The game wasn't as well received as its predecessors, but at the time was widely considered to be the best racing simulation available.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Grand_Prix_3_Coverart.png
