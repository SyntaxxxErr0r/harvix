51.9	Sonic_boom	Sonic boom	A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object traveling through the air faster than the speed of sound. Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding much like an explosion. The crack of a supersonic bullet passing overhead is an example of a sonic boom in miniature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Dopplereffectsourcemovingrightatmach1.4.gif/220px-Dopplereffectsourcemovingrightatmach1.4.gif
