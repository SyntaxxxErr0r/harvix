3.01	England_football_team	England national football team	The England national football team represents England in association football and is controlled by the Football Association, the governing body for football in England. England is the joint oldest national football team in the world, alongside Scotland, whom they played in the world's first international football match in 1872. Although most national football teams represent a sovereign state, England is one of the United Kingdom's Home Nations, meaning that it is permitted by FIFA statutes to maintain its own national side that competes in all major professional tournaments, with the exception of the Olympic Games. England's home ground is Wembley Stadium in London and their caretaker manager is Stuart Pearce.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/England_crest_2009.svg/160px-England_crest_2009.svg.png
