80.5	Speed_reading	Speed reading	Speed reading is a collection of reading methods which attempt to increase rates of reading without greatly reducing comprehension or retention. Methods include chunking and eliminating subvocalization. No absolute distinct "normal" and "speed-reading" types of reading exist in practice, since all readers use some of the techniques used in speed reading (such as identifying words without focusing on each letter, not sounding out all words, not sub-vocalizing some phrases, or spending less time on some phrases than others, and skimming small sections). Speed reading is characterized by an analysis of trade-offs between measures of speed and comprehension, recognizing that different types of reading call for different speed and comprehension rates, and that those rates may be improved with practice. The many available speed reading training programs include books, videos, software, and seminars.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Amy_Carter_and_Jimmy_Carter_participate_in_a_speed_reading_course_at_the_White_House._-_NARA_-_173797.jpg/220px-Amy_Carter_and_Jimmy_Carter_participate_in_a_speed_reading_course_at_the_White_House._-_NARA_-_173797.jpg
