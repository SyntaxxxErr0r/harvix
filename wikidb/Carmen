89.2	Carmen	Carmen	Carmen is an opera in four acts by the French composer Georges Bizet. The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris, on 3 March 1875, and was not at first particularly successful; its initial run extended to 36 performances. Before this run was concluded, Bizet died suddenly, and thus knew nothing of the opera's later celebrity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Georges_bizet.jpg/220px-Georges_bizet.jpg
