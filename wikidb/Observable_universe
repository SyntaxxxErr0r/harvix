161.5	Observable_universe	Observable universe	In Big Bang cosmology, the observable universe consists of the galaxies and other matter that humans can in principle observe from Earth in the present day, because light (or other signals) from those objects has had time to reach us since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. Assuming the universe is isotropic, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every directionâ€”that is, the observable universe is a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer, regardless of the shape of the universe as a whole. Every location in the universe has its own observable universe which may or may not overlap with the one centered on the Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Observable_Universe_with_Measurements_01.png/350px-Observable_Universe_with_Measurements_01.png
