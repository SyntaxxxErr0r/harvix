70.1	Names_of_God_in_Judaism	Names of God in Judaism	The numerous titles for God have been a source of debate among biblical scholars. YHWH is the only proper name of God in the Tanakh in the sense of a personal name. Words such as Elohim (god, or authority), El (mighty one), El Shaddai (almighty), Adonai (master), Elyon (most high), Avinu (our father), are not names but titles, highlighting different aspects of YHWH and the various roles of God.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Tetragrammaton_scripts.svg/137px-Tetragrammaton_scripts.svg.png
