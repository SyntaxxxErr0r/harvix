67.5	Great_Purge	Great Purge	The Great Purge was a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union orchestrated by Joseph Stalin from 1936 to 1938. It involved a large-scale purge of the Communist Party and government officials, repression of peasants, Red Army leadership, and the persecution of unaffiliated persons, characterized by widespread police surveillance, widespread suspicion of "saboteurs", imprisonment, and arbitrary executions. In Russian historiography the period of the most intense purge, 1937â€“1938, is called Yezhovshchina , after Nikolai Yezhov, the head of the Soviet secret police, NKVD.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/%D0%91%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD._%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8F_%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C_%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8._%D0%91%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD-2.jpg/220px-%D0%91%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD._%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8F_%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C_%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8._%D0%91%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD-2.jpg
