61.6	Greyhound	Greyhound	The Greyhound is a breed of sighthound that has been primarily bred for coursing game and racing, and the breed has also recently seen a resurgence in its popularity as a pedigree show dog and family pet. It is a gentle and intelligent breed. A combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds in excess of 18 metres per second (59 feet per second) or 63 kilometres per hour (39 mph).. At maximum acceleration, a greyhound reaches a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second for the first 250 metres of a race. The only other animal that can accelerate faster over a short distance is a cheetah that can reach speeds of 109 kilometres per hour (68 mph) over 3-4 strides from a standing start.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/GraceTheGreyhound.jpg/220px-GraceTheGreyhound.jpg
