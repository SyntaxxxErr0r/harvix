203.5	The_Grey_Album	The Grey Album	The Grey Album is a mashup album by Danger Mouse, released in 2004. It uses an a cappella version of rapper Jay-Z's The Black Album and couples it with instrumentals created from a multitude of unauthorized samples from The Beatles' LP The Beatles (more commonly known as The White Album). The Grey Album gained notoriety due to the response by EMI in attempting to halt its distribution, despite the fact that both Jay-Z and Sir Paul McCartney said they felt fine with the project.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Danger_Mouse_The_Grey_Album.svg/220px-Danger_Mouse_The_Grey_Album.svg.png
