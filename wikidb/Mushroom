78.6	Mushroom	Mushroom	A mushroom is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground on soil or on its food source. The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) or pores on the underside of the cap.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Amanita_muscaria_%28fly_agaric%29.JPG/200px-Amanita_muscaria_%28fly_agaric%29.JPG
