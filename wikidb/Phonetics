52.1	Phonetics	Phonetics	Phonetics (from the Greek: , phōnē, "sound, voice") is a branch of linguistics that comprises the study of the sounds of human speech, or—in the case of sign languages—the equivalent aspects of sign. It is concerned with the physical properties of speech sounds or signs : their physiological production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological status. Phonology, on the other hand, is concerned with the abstract, grammatical characterization of systems of sounds or signs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Languages_world_map-transparent_background.svg/150px-Languages_world_map-transparent_background.svg.png
