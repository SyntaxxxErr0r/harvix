13.21	Balao_class_submarine	Balao class submarine	The Balao class was a successful design of United States Navy submarine used during World War II, and with 122 units built, the largest class of submarines in the United States Navy. An improvement on the earlier Gato class, the boats had slight internal differences. The most significant improvement was the use of thicker, higher yield strength steel in the pressure hull skins and frames, which increased their test depth to 400 feet (120 m). Tang actually achieved a depth of 612 ft (187 m) during a test dive, and exceeded that test depth when taking on water in the forward torpedo room while evading a destroyer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/USS_Balao_SS-285.jpg/300px-USS_Balao_SS-285.jpg
