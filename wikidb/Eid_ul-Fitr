207.1	Eid_ul-Fitr	Eid ul-Fitr	Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid al-Fitr, Id-ul-Fitr, or Id al-Fitr , often abbreviated to Eid, is a Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting (sawm). Eid is an Arabic word meaning "festivity", while Fiá¹­r means "breaking the fast". The holiday celebrates the conclusion of the 29 or 30 days of dawn-to-sunset fasting during the entire month of Ramadan. The first day of Eid, therefore, falls on the first day of the month Shawwal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Eidulfitr_meal.jpg/225px-Eidulfitr_meal.jpg
