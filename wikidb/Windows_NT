96.0	Windows_NT	Windows NT	Windows NT is a family of operating systems produced by Microsoft, the first version of which was released in July 1993. It was a powerful high-level-language-based, processor-independent, multiprocessing, multiuser operating system with features comparable to Unix. It was intended to complement consumer versions of Windows that were based on MS-DOS. NT was the first fully 32-bit version of Windows, whereas its consumer-oriented counterparts, Windows 3.1x and Windows 9x, were 16-bit/32-bit hybrids. Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Home Server, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7 are effectively Windows NT, although they are not branded using that name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Windows_NT_logo.svg/300px-Windows_NT_logo.svg.png
