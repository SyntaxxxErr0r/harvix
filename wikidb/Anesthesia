107.5	Anesthesia	Anesthesia	Anesthesia, or anaesthesia (see spelling differences; from Greek , an-, "without"; and , aisthÄ“sis, "sensation"), traditionally meant the condition of having sensation (including the feeling of pain) blocked or temporarily taken away. It is a pharmacologically induced and reversible state of amnesia, analgesia, loss of responsiveness, loss of skeletal muscle reflexes or decreased fight-or-flight response, or all simultaneously. This allows patients to undergo surgery and other procedures without the distress and pain they would otherwise experience. An alternative definition is a "reversible lack of awareness," including a total lack of awareness (e.g. a general anesthetic) or a lack of awareness of a part of the body such as a spinal anesthetic. The pre-existing word anesthesia was suggested by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. in 1846 as a word to use to describe this state.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Southworth_%26_Hawes_-_First_etherized_operation_%28re-enactment%29.jpg/220px-Southworth_%26_Hawes_-_First_etherized_operation_%28re-enactment%29.jpg
