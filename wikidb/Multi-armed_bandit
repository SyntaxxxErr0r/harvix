16.03	Multi-armed_bandit	Multi-armed bandit	In statistics, particularly in the design of sequential experiments, a multi-armed bandit takes its name from a traditional slot machine (one-armed bandit). Multiple levers are considered in the motivating applications in statistics. When pulled, each lever provides a reward drawn from a distribution associated with that specific lever. The objective of the gambler is to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of lever pulls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/Multi-armed-bandit.jpg/220px-Multi-armed-bandit.jpg
