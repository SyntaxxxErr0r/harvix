204.7	Computer-aided_design	Computer-aided design	Computer-aided design , also known as computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), is the use of computer technology for the process of design and design-documentation. Computer Aided Drafting describes the process of drafting with a computer. CADD software provides the user with input-tools for the purpose of streamlining design processes; drafting, documentation, and manufacturing processes. CADD output is often in the form of electronic files for print or machining operations. CADD software uses either vector based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting, or may also produce raster graphics showing the overall appearance of designed objects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Schneckengetriebe.png/220px-Schneckengetriebe.png
