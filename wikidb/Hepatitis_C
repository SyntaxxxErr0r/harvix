125.4	Hepatitis_C	Hepatitis C	Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver, caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to cirrhosis, which is generally apparent after many years. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will go on to develop liver failure, liver cancer or life-threatening esophageal and gastric varices.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/HCV_EM_picture_2.png/230px-HCV_EM_picture_2.png
