2.00	QF_25_pdr	Ordnance QF 25 pounder	The Ordnance QF 25 pounder, or more simply, 25-pounder or 25-pdr, was introduced into service just before World War II, during which it served as the major British field gun/howitzer. It was considered by many to be the best field artillery piece of the war , combining high rates of fire with a reasonably lethal shell in a highly mobile piece. It was the British Army's primary artillery field piece well into the 1960s, with smaller numbers serving in training units until the 1980s. Many Commonwealth of Nations countries used theirs in active or reserve service until about the 1970s and ammunition for the weapon is currently being produced by Pakistan Ordnance Factories.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/25_Pounder_Gun.JPG/300px-25_Pounder_Gun.JPG
