It was released in 1996 after leaving Death Row Records, and was the first release on his then newly established Aftermath Entertainment. In spite of Dr. Dre's name being on the album, and it being certified platinum, it received mixed reviews and was not amongst the year's more commercially successful releases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/DrDre-PresentsTheAftermath.jpg/220px-DrDre-PresentsTheAftermath.jpg
