2.00	BadJocks.com	BadJocks.com	BadJocks.com is a website that covers sports-related misconduct and crime at all levels, from professional to children's, by not only the athletes themselves but coaches and spectators as well. Creator and content provider Bob Reno has since 2000 written daily items on not only well-covered events such as the rape charges against three Duke lacrosse players and the Minnesota Vikings "love boat" scandal but less-reported local events as well, with video clips sometimes included. While the site's news and audience are primarily U.S.-based, foreign news, particularly soccer-related, has been covered as well. He bills the site as "Where COPS Meets SportsCenter". In 2008 Time chose the site as one of 25 in its first annual blog index, and in 2009 Sports Illustrated named the site one of the decade's five most influential blogs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9c/Badjocks_screenshot.jpg/250px-Badjocks_screenshot.jpg
