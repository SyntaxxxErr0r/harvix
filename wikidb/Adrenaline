51.1	Adrenaline	Epinephrine	Epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) is a hormone and a neurotransmitter. It increases heart rate, constricts blood vessels, dilates air passages and participates in the fight-or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system. In chemical terms, adrenaline is one of a group of monoamines called the catecholamines. It is produced in some neurons of the central nervous system, and in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla from the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. The device used to spread this epinephrine is usually called a EpiPen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Epinephrine_structure_with_descriptor.svg/180px-Epinephrine_structure_with_descriptor.svg.png
