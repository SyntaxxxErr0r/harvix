3.10	Pico_da_Bandeira	Pico da Bandeira	Pico da Bandeira ( Flag Peak) is the third highest mountain in Brazil, situated near the border of Esp√≠rito Santo and Minas Gerais. It is the highest point in both states as well. It was historically considered the highest mountain in Brazil until the 1950s, when the Pico da Neblina was explored and measured near the Venezuelan border. The name means "Peak of the Flag" and it was so named after Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, ordered a flag to be flown on it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Pico_da_bandeira.jpg/280px-Pico_da_bandeira.jpg
