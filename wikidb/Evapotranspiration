55.0	Evapotranspiration	Evapotranspiration	Evapotranspiration is a term used to describe the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth's land surface to atmosphere. Evaporation accounts for the movement of water to the air from sources such as the soil, canopy interception, and waterbodies. Transpiration accounts for the movement of water within a plant and the subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata in its leaves. Evapotranspiration is an important part of the water cycle. An element (such as a tree) that contributes to evapotranspiration can be called an evapotranspirator.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Surface_water_cycle.svg/260px-Surface_water_cycle.svg.png
