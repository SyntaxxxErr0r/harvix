23.74	Cat_litter	Litter box	A litter box, sometimes called a sandbox, poopy box, litter tray, litter pan, dirt box, or catbox, is an indoor feces and urine disposal box for cats (as well as rabbits, ferrets, small dogs, and other pets that naturally or through training will make use of such a repository) that are permitted free roam of a home but who cannot or do not always go outside to relieve themselves. Many owners of these animals prefer not to let them roam outside for fear that they might succumb to the elements or get hit by a car, so a cat litter box makes it possible to shelter pets from these risks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Litter_box.jpg/220px-Litter_box.jpg
