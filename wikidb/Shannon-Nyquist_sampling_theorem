1.00	Shannon-Nyquist_sampling_theorem	Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem	The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, after Harry Nyquist and Claude Shannon, is a fundamental result in the field of information theory, in particular telecommunications and signal processing. Sampling is the process of converting a signal (for example, a function of continuous time or space) into a numeric sequence (a function of discrete time or space). Shannon's version of the theorem states:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Bandlimited.svg/200px-Bandlimited.svg.png
