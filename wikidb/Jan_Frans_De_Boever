1.02	Jan_Frans_De_Boever	Jan Frans De Boever	Jan Frans De Boever (Ghent, Belgium, 8 June 1872 - 23 May 1949) was a Flemish Symbolist painter. He was very successful during most of his lifetime, and he considered himself as one of the best painters ever in his country. His megalomaniac character made him a solitary and isolated artist, whose work moved the last few decades to the U.S.A. where became a beloved artist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/JFDeBoever.jpg/220px-JFDeBoever.jpg
