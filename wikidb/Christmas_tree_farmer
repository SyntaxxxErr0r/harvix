1.00	Christmas_tree_farmer	Christmas tree cultivation	Christmas tree cultivation is an agricultural, forestry, and horticultural occupation which involves growing pine, spruce, and fir trees specifically for use as Christmas trees. The first Christmas tree farm was established in 1901, but most consumers continued to obtain their trees from forests until the 1930s and 1940s. Christmas tree farming was once seen only as a viable alternative for low-quality farmland, but that perception has changed within the agriculture industry. For optimum yield and quality, land should be flat or gently rolling and relatively free of debris and undergrowth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Christmas_tree_farm_FL.JPG/220px-Christmas_tree_farm_FL.JPG
