62.9	Lava	Lava	Lava refers both to molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the resulting rock after solidification and cooling. This molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid at temperatures from 700 째C to 1,200 째C (1,300 째F to 2,200 째F). Up to 100,000 times as viscous as water, lava can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying because of its thixotropic and shear thinning properties.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Pahoeoe_fountain_edit2.jpg/250px-Pahoeoe_fountain_edit2.jpg
