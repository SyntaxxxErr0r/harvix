2.01	Contact_immunity	Contact immunity	Contact immunity is the property of some vaccines, where a vaccinated individual can confer immunity upon unimmunized individuals through contact with bodily fluids or excrement. In other words, if Mark has been vaccinated for virus X and John has not, John can receive immunity to virus X just by coming into contact with Mark.
