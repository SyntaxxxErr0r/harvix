1.00	Naturality	Natural transformation	In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a natural transformation provides a way of transforming one functor into another while respecting the internal structure (i.e. the composition of morphisms) of the categories involved. Hence, a natural transformation can be considered to be a "morphism of functors". Indeed this intuition can be formalized to define so-called functor categories. Natural transformations are, after categories and functors, one of the most basic notions of category theory and consequently appear in the majority of its applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Natural_transformation.svg/175px-Natural_transformation.svg.png
