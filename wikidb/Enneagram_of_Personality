70.1	Enneagram_of_Personality	Enneagram of Personality	The Enneagram of Personality (or simply the Enneagram, from the Greek words ennea and grammos ) is a model of human personality which is principally used as a typology of nine interconnected personality types. Principally developed by Oscar Ichazo and Claudio Naranjo, it is also partly based on earlier teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff. The typology defines nine personality types (sometimes referred to as "enneatypes"), which are also indicated by the points of a geometric figure, called an enneagram, which also indicate some of the connections between the types. As there are different schools of thought among Enneagram theorists about some aspects of how it is understood, its interpretation is not always unified or consistent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Enneagram.svg/200px-Enneagram.svg.png
