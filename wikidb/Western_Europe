115.6	Western_Europe	Western Europe	Western Europe is a loose term for the collection of countries in the European continent, though this definition is context-dependent and carries cultural and political connotations. One definition describes Western Europe as a geographic entity—the region lying in the Western part of Europe. Another definition was created during the Cold War (approx. 1945-1991) and used to describe the non-Communist states of Europe that were allied (to an extent each) with and influenced by the United States to some degree. For this purpose the Western European Union (1954–2011; today part of the European Union), a defensive alliance among non-communist European nations during the Cold War, was drafted in 1948. As a result, countries culturally and geographically associated with other European regions that steered clear of Soviet influence during the Cold War are usually included, while western members of the former Eastern Bloc (with the exception of Eastern Germany) are excluded.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Europe_1988.svg/333px-Europe_1988.svg.png
