95.5	Dyson_sphere	Dyson sphere	A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure originally described by Freeman Dyson. Such a "sphere" would be a system of orbiting solar power satellites meant to completely encompass a star and capture most or all of its energy output. Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the long-term survival and escalating energy needs of a technological civilization, and proposed that searching for evidence of the existence of such structures might lead to the detection of advanced intelligent extraterrestrial life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Dyson_Ring.PNG/220px-Dyson_Ring.PNG
