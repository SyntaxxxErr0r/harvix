125.1	Progressive_rock	Progressive rock	Progressive rock (also referred to as prog rock or prog) is a subgenre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s as part of "a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility." John Covach, in Contemporary Music Review, says that many thought it would not just "succeed the pop of the 1960s as much as take its rightful place beside the modern classical music of Stravinsky and Bart√≥k."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/DarkSideOfTheMoon1973.jpg/240px-DarkSideOfTheMoon1973.jpg
