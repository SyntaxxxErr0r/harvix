66.5	Red_herring	Red herring	A red herring is a clue or piece of information which is intended to be misleading, or distracting from the actual issue. For example, in mystery fiction, where the identity of a criminal is being sought, an innocent party may be purposefully cast in a guilty light by the author through the employment of deceptive clues, false emphasis, "loaded" words or other descriptive tricks of the trade. The reader's suspicions are thus misdirected, allowing the true culprit to go (temporarily at least) undetected. A false protagonist is another example of a red herring.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Red_herring.jpg/330px-Red_herring.jpg
