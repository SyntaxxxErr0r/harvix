89.1	Power_(physics)	Power (physics)	In physics, power is the rate at which energy is transferred, used, or transformed. For example, the rate at which a light bulb transforms electrical energy into heat and light is measured in wattsâ€”the more wattage, the more power, or equivalently the more electrical energy is used per unit time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Ansel_Adams_-_National_Archives_79-AAB-02.jpg/400px-Ansel_Adams_-_National_Archives_79-AAB-02.jpg
