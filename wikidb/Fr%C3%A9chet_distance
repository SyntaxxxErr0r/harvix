1.00	Fr%C3%A9chet_distance	Fréchet distance	An important tool for calculating the Fréchet distance of two curves is the free-space diagram, which was introduced by Alt and Godau. The free-space diagram between two curves for a given distance threshold ε is a two-dimensional region in the parameter space that consist of all point pairs on the two curves at distance at most ε:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Free-space-diagram.png/220px-Free-space-diagram.png
