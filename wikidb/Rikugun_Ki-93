1.00	Rikugun_Ki-93	Rikugun Ki-93	The Rikugun Ki-93 was a prototype Japanese twin-engined fighter aircraft of the Second World War. Designed by the Army Aerotechnical Research Institute, to be a heavy fighter armed with large calibre cannon to serve in the anti-shipping or bomber-destroyer roles, only one example of the Ki-93 was completed, this damaged on its maiden flight, being destroyed by American bombing before it could be flown again.
