2.00	World_Orders_Old_and_New	World Orders Old and New	World Orders Old and New is a book by Noam Chomsky, first published in 1994 and updated in 1996 by Columbia University Press. In this book, Chomsky takes on the international scene since 1945, devoting particular attention to events following the collapse of the Soviet Union. He develops a critique of Western government, from imperialist foreign policies to the Clinton administration's promises to the poor. His judgment of the "new world order" foresees a growing abyss between the rich and poor, both internationally and in the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/World_Orders%2C_Old_and_New.jpg/200px-World_Orders%2C_Old_and_New.jpg
