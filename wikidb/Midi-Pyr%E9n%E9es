3.11	Midi-Pyr%E9n%E9es	Midi-Pyrénées	Midi-Pyrénées has no historical or geographical unity. It is one of the regions of France created in the late 20th century to serve as a hinterland and zone of influence for its capital, Toulouse, one of a handful of so-called "balancing metropolises" . Another example of this is the region of Rhône-Alpes which was created as the region for Lyon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Flag_of_Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es.svg/120px-Flag_of_Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es.svg.png
