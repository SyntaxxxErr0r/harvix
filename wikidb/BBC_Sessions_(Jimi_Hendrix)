3.00	BBC_Sessions_(Jimi_Hendrix)	BBC Sessions (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)	BBC Sessions is an album of recordings by the rock group The Jimi Hendrix Experience, released on MCA Records on June 2, 1998. It contains all the surviving tracks from their various appearances on BBC radio programmes, such as Saturday Club and Top Gear, recorded in 1967. At a BBC radio 'session', a practice still alive in British radio today, a band is required to record material in a studio quickly, with limited overdubbing, largely limited to and relying upon their live sound. Many groups as part of this tradition choosing to record some songs that are not part of their main repertoire. The album also includes the only two surviving Hendrix UK TV soundtracks (both BBC) Late Night Line Up ("Manic Depression" only survives) and the 1969 Lulu Show (complete).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/BBC_Sessions.jpg/220px-BBC_Sessions.jpg
