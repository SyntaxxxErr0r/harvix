54.6	William_Kentridge	William Kentridge	William Kentridge (born 28 April 1955) is a South African artist best known for his prints, drawings, and animated films. These are constructed by filming a drawing, making erasures and changes, and filming it again. He continues this process meticulously, giving each change to the drawing a quarter of a second to two seconds' screen time. A single drawing will be altered and filmed this way until the end of a scene. These palimpsest-like drawings are later displayed along with the films as finished pieces of art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/William_Kentridge_DSC_2685.JPG/220px-William_Kentridge_DSC_2685.JPG
