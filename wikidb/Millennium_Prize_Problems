59.1	Millennium_Prize_Problems	Millennium Prize Problems	The Millennium Prize Problems are seven problems in mathematics that were stated by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000. As of March 2012, six of the problems remain unsolved. A correct solution to any of the problems results in a US$1,000,000 prize (sometimes called a Millennium Prize) being awarded by the institute. The Poincar√© conjecture, the only Millennium Prize Problem to be solved so far, was solved by Grigori Perelman, but he declined the award in 2010.
