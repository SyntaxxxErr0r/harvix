15.20	One-Man_Army_Corps	OMAC (Buddy Blank)	OMAC is a superhero comic book created in 1974 by Jack Kirby and published by DC Comics. The character was created towards the end of Kirby's contract with the publisher, following the cancellation of Kirby's New Gods, and was reportedly developed strictly due to Kirby needing to fill his contractual quota of 15 pages a week. As envisioned by Kirby, OMAC is essentially Captain America set in the future, an idea Kirby had toyed with some years earlier while on staff at Marvel Comics, but had never realized.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/OMAC6.jpg/200px-OMAC6.jpg
