2.10	Ionian_School_(music)	Ionian School (music)	The term Ionian (or Heptanese) School of Music (Greek: Επτανησιακή Σχολή, literally: Seven Islands' School) denotes the musical production of a group Heptanesian composers, whose heyday was from the early 19th century till approximately the 1950s. Conventionally, it is divided in two periods: the First Generation (Πρὠτη Γενιά) from 1815, till the end of the 1860s, and the Second Generation (Δεύτερη Γενιά) from 1871 and onwards. Prominent representatives of this genre include Nikolaos Mantzaros, Spyridon Xyndas, Spyridon Samaras, Pavlos Carrer and Dionysios Lavrangas. The Music Museum of the Philharmonic Society of Corfu has in its collections several scores by these and other 19th and 20th century Ionian composers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/XyndasAnnaWinter.JPG/220px-XyndasAnnaWinter.JPG
