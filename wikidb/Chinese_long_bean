1.00	Chinese_long_bean	Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis	Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis, the yardlong bean, is also known as bora, the long-podded cowpea, asparagus bean, snake bean, or Chinese long bean. It is known as dau gok in Cantonese, jiang dou (豇豆) in Standard Chinese, thua fak yao (ถั่วฝักยาว) in Thai and kacang panjang in Indonesian and Malay, 'SITAO' or 'SITAW' in Tagalog, utong in Ilokano, bora or bodi in the West Indies and vali, Borboti in Bengali, India, eeril in Goa, India or đậu đũa (Vietnamese, literally: chopstick bean), ju-roku sasage (十六ササゲ) in Japan. Despite the name, the pods are actually only about half a yard long; the subspecies name sesquipedalis (one-and-a-half-foot-long) is a rather exact approximation of the pods' length.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Long_Bean.JPG/220px-Long_Bean.JPG
