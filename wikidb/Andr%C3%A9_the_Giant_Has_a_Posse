57.4	Andr%C3%A9_the_Giant_Has_a_Posse	Andre the Giant Has a Posse	Andre the Giant Has a Posse is a street art and viral marketing campaign based on a design by Shepard Fairey created in 1989 in Providence, Rhode Island. Distributed by the skater community, the stickers featuring an image of Andr√© the Giant began showing up in many cities across the U.S.A. At the time Fairey declared the campaign to be "an experiment in phenomenology". Over time the artwork has been reused in a number of ways and has become worldwide. At the same time, Fairey altered the work stylistically and semantically into the OBEY Giant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/75/AndreTheGiantSticker.gif
