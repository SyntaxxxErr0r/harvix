56.6	Panko	Panko	Panko ) is a variety of flaky bread crumb used in Japanese cuisine as a crunchy coating for fried foods, such as tonkatsu. Panko is made from bread which has had the crusts removed, and it has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in Western cuisine. Outside Japan, it is becoming more popular for use in Asian and non-Asian dishes, is often used on fish and seafood, and is often available in Asian markets and specialty stores. Increasingly, it is also available in many large supermarkets. In February 2012, the U.S. fast-food chain Wendy's introduced a cod fillet sandwich that they advertised as having a panko breading. Panko is produced worldwide, particularly in Asian countries, including Japan, Korea, Thailand, China, and Vietnam.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/PankoBreadcrumbsInABag.jpg/220px-PankoBreadcrumbsInABag.jpg
