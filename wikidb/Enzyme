121.4	Enzyme	Enzyme	Enzymes ( ) are proteins that catalyze (i.e., increase the rates of) chemical reactions. In enzymatic reactions, the molecules at the beginning of the process, called substrates, are converted into different molecules, called products. Almost all chemical reactions in a biological cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates sufficient for life. Since enzymes are selective for their substrates and speed up only a few reactions from among many possibilities, the set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/GLO1_Homo_sapiens_small_fast.gif
