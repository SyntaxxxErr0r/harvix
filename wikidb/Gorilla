84.5	Gorilla	Gorilla	Gorillas are the largest extant species of primates. They are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Africa. Gorillas comprise one eponymous genus that is divided into two species and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of a human, from 95â€“99% depending on what is counted, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the bonobo and chimpanzee.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Male_gorilla_in_SF_zoo.jpg/220px-Male_gorilla_in_SF_zoo.jpg
