60.5	Edmund_Husserl	Edmund Husserl	Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl (German pronunciation: ; April 8, 1859, Proßnitz, Moravia, Austrian Empire – April 26, 1938, Freiburg, Germany) was a philosopher and mathematician and the founder of the 20th century philosophical school of phenomenology. He broke with the positivist orientation of the science and philosophy of his day, yet he elaborated critiques of historicism and of psychologism in logic. Not limited to empiricism, but believing that experience is the source of all knowledge, he worked on a method of phenomenological reduction by which a subject may come to know directly an essence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Edmund_Husserl_1900.jpg/220px-Edmund_Husserl_1900.jpg
