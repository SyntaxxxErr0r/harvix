70.8	Sinai_Peninsula	Sinai Peninsula	The Sinai Peninsula or Sinai (Arabic: ‎ sīnā' ; Hebrew סיני) is a triangular peninsula in Egypt about 60,000 km2 (23,000 sq mi) in area. It is situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and the Red Sea to the south, and is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia as opposed to Africa, effectively serving as a land bridge between two continents. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area), and has a population of approximately 500.000 people. In addition to its formal name, Egyptians also refer to it affectionately as the "Land of Fayrouz", based on the Ancient Egyptian "Dumafkat", which has the same meaning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Sinai-peninsula-map.jpg/280px-Sinai-peninsula-map.jpg
