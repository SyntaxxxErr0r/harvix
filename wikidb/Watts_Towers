The Towers were built by Italian immigrant construction worker Sabato ("Sam" or "Simon") Rodia in his spare time over a period of 33 years, from 1921 to 1954. The work is an example of non-traditional vernacular architecture and American Na√Øve art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Watts-towers.jpg/250px-Watts-towers.jpg
