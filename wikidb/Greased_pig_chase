1.00	Greased_pig_chase	Pig wrestling	Pig wrestling or "wrasslin' " (also known as Pig scramble and with the variants hog wrestling and greased pig catching) is a type of game sometimes played at agricultural shows such as state and county fairs, in which contestants, usually children or young adults, try to grab a slippery pig. In the most common version of the game, a team of four members chases a domestic pig around a fenced-off mud pit and attempts to place it in a barrel, in a race against the clock. In some events the pigs are greased with vegetable or mineral oil in order to make catching the pig more difficult.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Greased_pig_contest.jpg/220px-Greased_pig_contest.jpg
