137.8	Foo_Camp	Foo Camp	Foo Camp is an annual hacker event hosted by publisher O'Reilly Media. O'Reilly describes it as "the wiki of conferences", where the program is developed by the attendees at the event, using big whiteboard schedule templates that can be rewritten or overwritten by attendees to optimize the schedule. The goal of the event is to reach out to new people who will increase the company's intelligence about new technologies, and to create opportunities for cross-pollination between people and technologies that are on the O'Reilly radar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Tim_O%27Reilly_in_Foo_China_2007.JPG/220px-Tim_O%27Reilly_in_Foo_China_2007.JPG
