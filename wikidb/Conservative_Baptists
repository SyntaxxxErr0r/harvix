2.00	Conservative_Baptists	Conservative Baptists	Conservative Baptists is a name used to describe members of the Conservative Baptist Association of America (an association formed in 1947 at Atlantic City, New Jersey), used loosely as the larger "Conservative Baptist Movement", or used as a description of Baptists that hold a "conservative" viewpoint of theology in contrast to "liberals". The terminology is often applied to members of the Southern Baptist Convention, whose recent history has seen a struggle between "conservatives" and "moderates". Yet, when applied to individual Baptists in general, the term has little objective meaning, and often only means some individual Baptist is more conservative than another individual Baptist. But "conservative" Baptists can usually be expected to accept the inerrancy of the Bible, the creation account found in Genesis, the virgin birth, perfect life and substitutionary atonement of Christ, and His literal return.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Baptism_logo.jpg/100px-Baptism_logo.jpg
