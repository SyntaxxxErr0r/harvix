It is a short summary of the full spectrum of critical &amp; academic writing. It does not cover the variety of critical approaches that can be applied when writing about a subject. However as Harwood and Hadley (2004) and Hyland (2004) have pointed out the amount of variation that exists between different disciplines may mean that we cannot refer to a single academic literacy.
