Recording for the album began in March 1980, when Criss was still officially a member of Kiss. The album sold very poorly, and was not re-released on CD until 1997, as the Kiss reunion tour was underway.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/07/Out_of_Control_%28Peter_Criss_album%29_cover.jpg/220px-Out_of_Control_%28Peter_Criss_album%29_cover.jpg
