They feed mainly on seeds which they find by foraging on the ground. They typically lay two eggs in a simple nest of twigs and grass. Their plumage is mostly greyish-brown with a pattern of spots or bars. The Zebra Dove and Diamond Dove are commonly kept in captivity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Geopelia-striata-R%C3%A9union.jpg/250px-Geopelia-striata-R%C3%A9union.jpg
