58.5	Java_(island)	Java	Java (Indonesian: ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of 135 million (excluding the 3.6 million on the island of Madura which is administered as part of the provinces of Java), Java is the world's most populous island, and one of the most densely-populated places on the globe. Java is the home of 60 percent of the Indonesian population. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 40s. Java was also occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army from 1942 through the defeat of the Japanese Empire in 1945, and this put a temporary end to all thoughts of independence. Java dominates Indonesia's social, political, and economic life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Java_Topography.png/220px-Java_Topography.png
