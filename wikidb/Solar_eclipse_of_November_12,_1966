1.10	Solar_eclipse_of_November_12,_1966	Solar eclipse of November 12, 1966	A total solar eclipse occurred on November 12, 1966. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partially obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across the surface of the Earth, while a partial solar eclipse will be visible over a region thousands of kilometres wide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/SE1966Nov12T.png/320px-SE1966Nov12T.png
