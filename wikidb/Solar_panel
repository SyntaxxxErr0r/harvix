81.7	Solar_panel	Solar panel	A solar panel (also solar module, photovoltaic module or photovoltaic panel) is a packaged, connected assembly of photovoltaic cells. The solar panel can be used as a component of a larger photovoltaic system to generate and supply electricity in commercial and residential applications. Each panel is rated by its DC output power under standard test conditions, and typically ranges from 100 to 450 watts. The efficiency of a panel determines the area of a panel given the same rated output - an 8% efficient 230 watt panel will have twice the area of a 16% efficient 230 watt panel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Solar_panels_in_Ogiinuur.jpg/300px-Solar_panels_in_Ogiinuur.jpg
