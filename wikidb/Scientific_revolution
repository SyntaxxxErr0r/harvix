70.7	Scientific_revolution	Scientific revolution	The scientific revolution is an era associated primarily with the 16th and 17th centuries during which new ideas and knowledge in physics, astronomy, biology, medicine and chemistry transformed medieval and ancient views of nature and laid the foundations for modern science. According to most accounts, the scientific revolution began in Europe towards the end of the Renaissance era and continued through the late 18th century, the later period known as The Enlightenment. It was sparked by the publication in 1543 of two works that changed the course of science: Nicolaus Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium and Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human body).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Libr0310.jpg/220px-Libr0310.jpg
