88.4	Human_capital	Human capital	Human capital is the stock of competencies, knowledge and personality attributes embodied in the ability to perform labor so as to produce economic value. Human capital is vitally important for an organization's success (Crook et al., 2011); human capital increases through education and experience. Many early economic theories refer to it simply as workforce, one of three factors of production, and consider it to be a fungible resource -- homogeneous and easily interchangeable. Other conceptions of this labor dispense with these assumptions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png
