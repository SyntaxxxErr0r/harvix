36.38	Pitch_drop_experiment	Pitch drop experiment	The pitch drop experiment is a long-term experiment which measures the flow of a piece of pitch over many years. Pitch is the name for any of a number of highly viscous liquids which appear solid, most commonly bitumen. At room temperature, tar pitch flows at a very slow rate, taking several years to form a single drop.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/University_of_Queensland_Pitch_drop_experiment-6-2.jpg/150px-University_of_Queensland_Pitch_drop_experiment-6-2.jpg
