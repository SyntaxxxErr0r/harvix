56.6	House_Sparrow	House Sparrow	The House Sparrow is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found in most parts of the world. One of about 25 species in the genus Passer, the House Sparrow occurs naturally in most of Europe, the Mediterranean region, and much of Asia. Its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions, including parts of Australia, Africa, and the Americas, make it the most widely distributed wild bird. The House Sparrow is strongly associated with human habitations, and can live in urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, and deserts away from human development. A small bird, it has a length of 16 centimetres (6.3 in) and a weight of 24–39.5 grams (0.85–1.39 oz). Females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey, and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. The House Sparrow feeds mostly on the seeds of grains and weeds, and insects, and can perform complex and unusual tasks to obtain food. The predators of the House Sparrow include domestic cats, hawks, owls, and many other predatory birds and mammals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/House_Sparrow_mar08.jpg/220px-House_Sparrow_mar08.jpg
