63.1	Adventure_game	Adventure game	An adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle-solving instead of physical challenge. The genre's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media such as literature and film, encompassing a wide variety of literary genres. Nearly all adventure games are designed for a single player, since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/TWW_screenshot_006.jpg/250px-TWW_screenshot_006.jpg
