77.7	Natural_history	Natural history	Natural history is the scientific research of plants or animals, leaning more towards observational rather than experimental methods of study, and encompasses more research published in magazines than in academic journals. Grouped among the natural sciences, natural history is the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms. That is a very broad designation in a world filled with many narrowly focused disciplines. So while modern natural history dates historically from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the medieval Arabic world through to the scattered European Renaissance scientists working in near isolation, today's field is more of a cross discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences. For example, geobiology has a strong multi-disciplinary nature combining scientists and scientific knowledge of many specialty sciences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Table_of_Natural_History%2C_Cyclopaedia%2C_Volume_2.jpg/300px-Table_of_Natural_History%2C_Cyclopaedia%2C_Volume_2.jpg
