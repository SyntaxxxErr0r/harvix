1.00	SET_7	SET 7	The SET 7 was a military trainer and reconnaissance aircraft that was produced in Romania in the mid 1930s. It was originally designed as a conventional single-bay biplane, with slightly staggered wings, a standard undercarriage with fixed tailskid, and a tandem open-cockpit arrangement for the pilot and instructor or observer. Power was supplied by an Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar radial engine, and from the outset the aircraft was equipped for wireless and photographic reconnaissance duties.
