146.3	Ernst_Haeckel	Ernst Haeckel	Ernst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel (February 16, 1834 â€“ August 9, 1919), also written von Haeckel, was an eminent German biologist, naturalist, philosopher, physician, professor and artist who discovered, described and named thousands of new species, mapped a genealogical tree relating all life forms, and coined many terms in biology, including anthropogeny, ecology, phylum, phylogeny, stem cell, and the kingdom Protista. Haeckel promoted and popularized Charles Darwin's work in Germany and developed the controversial recapitulation theory ("ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny") claiming that an individual organism's biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarizes its species' evolutionary development, or phylogeny.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Ernst_Haeckel_5.jpg/220px-Ernst_Haeckel_5.jpg
