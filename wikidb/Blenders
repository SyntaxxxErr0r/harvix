3.40	Blenders	Blender	A blender is a kitchen and laboratory appliance used to mix, puree, or emulsify food and other substances. A stationary blender consists of a blender jar with blade at the bottom, rotated by a motor in the base. The newer immersion blender configuration has a motor on top connected by a shaft to a blade at the bottom, which can be used with any container.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/ElectricBlender.jpg/220px-ElectricBlender.jpg
