65.4	Particulate	Particulates	Particulates – also known as particulate matter , suspended particulate matter (SPM), fine particles, and soot – are tiny subdivisions of solid matter suspended in a gas or liquid. In contrast, aerosol refers to particles and/or liquid droplets and the gas together. Sources of particulate matter can be man made or natural. Air pollution and water pollution can take the form of solid particulate matter, or be dissolved. Salt is an example of a dissolved contaminant in water, while sand is generally a solid particulate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Cloud_3.JPG/250px-Cloud_3.JPG
