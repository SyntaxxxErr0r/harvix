57.8	Refrigerator	Refrigerator	A refrigerator (colloquially fridge) is a common household appliance that consists of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic, or chemical) that transfers heat from the inside of the fridge to its external environment so that the inside of the fridge is cooled to a temperature below the ambient temperature of the room. Cooling is a popular food storage technique in developed countries and works by decreasing or even arresting the reproduction rate of bacteria. The device is thus used to reduce the rate of spoilage of foodstuffs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/2011-05-09_14-56-45_407.jpg/220px-2011-05-09_14-56-45_407.jpg
