61.5	Human_rights_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China	Human rights in the People's Republic of China	Human rights in the People's Republic of China are a matter of dispute between the Chinese government, other countries, international NGOs, and dissidents inside the country. Organizations such as the U.S. State Department, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch have accused the Chinese government of restricting the freedoms of speech, movement, and religion of Chinese citizens. The Chinese government argues for a "wider" definition of human rights, to include economic and social as well as political rights, all in relation to "national culture" and the level of development of the country. In this regard, China claims that human rights are being improved. China also repeated many times that its constitution specifies not only citizenship rights but also the "Four Cardinal Principles"; in legal respects the "Four Cardinal Principles" are higher than citizenship rights, meaning there was a legal basis according to the Chinese constitution when China arrested people who wanted, according to China, to overthrow these principles. Chinese people who obey these principles can, according to the Chinese government, enjoy all Chinese citizenship rights.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/National_Emblem_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/125px-National_Emblem_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png
