4.10	Auto-correlation	Autocorrelation	Autocorrelation is the cross-correlation of a signal with itself. Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time separation between them. It is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of a periodic signal which has been buried under noise, or identifying the missing fundamental frequency in a signal implied by its harmonic frequencies. It is often used in signal processing for analyzing functions or series of values, such as time domain signals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Acf_new.svg/220px-Acf_new.svg.png
