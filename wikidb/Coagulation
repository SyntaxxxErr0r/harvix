70.5	Coagulation	Coagulation	Coagulation is a complex process by which blood forms clots. It is an important part of hemostasis, the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel, wherein a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin-containing clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel. Disorders of coagulation can lead to an increased risk of bleeding or obstructive clotting (thrombosis).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Coagulation_full.svg/550px-Coagulation_full.svg.png
