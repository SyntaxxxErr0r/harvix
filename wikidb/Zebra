81.6	Zebra	Zebra	Zebras are several species of African equids (horse family) united by their distinctive black and white stripes. Their stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. They are generally social animals that live in small harems to large herds. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Plains_Zebra_Equus_quagga.jpg/220px-Plains_Zebra_Equus_quagga.jpg
