13.01	Hoop_house	Hoop house	A hoop house (also called a hoop greenhouse or hoophouse) is a greenhouse with a plastic roof wrapped over flexible piping. The interior heats up because incoming solar radiation from the sun warms plants, soil, and other things inside the building faster than heat can escape the structure. Air warmed by the heat from hot interior surfaces is retained in the building by the roof and wall.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Hoop_house.jpg/250px-Hoop_house.jpg
