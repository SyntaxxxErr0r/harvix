2.10	Saturation_bombing	Carpet bombing	Carpet bombing is a large aerial bombing done in a progressive manner to inflict damage in every part of a selected area of land. The phrase evokes the image of explosions completely covering an area, in the same way that a carpet covers a floor. Carpet bombing is usually achieved by dropping many unguided bombs. In contrast to precision bombing, it is not aimed at a small target, such as a bunker, an airfield, or a military unit. One of its uses is the aerial bombing of cities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Rotterdam.jpg/220px-Rotterdam.jpg
