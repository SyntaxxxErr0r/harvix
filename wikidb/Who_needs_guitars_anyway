Includes the hit singles "Back In My Life", "Better Off Alone", "Will I Ever", "The Lonely One", and "Celebrate Our Love" (listed in chronological order, and descending order of popularity). The album debuted in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 album sales chart in the United States in 1999 and through 2000. There were three different covers to Who Needs Guitars Anyway when the album was released. The first was of Judith Pronk sitting on a record needle naked with only a cowboy hat on in a blur. The second was of Judith pointing a glowing finger and smiling. The third was much like the first but with Judith clothed. There was much controversy over the original cover which slated the release of the other two covers. Although; the original cover was briefly used to promote the album in which promo posters and flats were produced but quickly removed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/51X2Bo9ksfAL.jpg/220px-51X2Bo9ksfAL.jpg
