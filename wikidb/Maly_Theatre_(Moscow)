4.00	Maly_Theatre_(Moscow)	Maly Theatre (Moscow)	Maly Theatre (, literally Small Theatre as opposed to nearby Bolshoi, or Grand, opera theater) is a drama theater in Moscow, Russia. Established in 1806 and operating on its present site on the Theatre Square since 1824, the theatre traces its history to the Moscow University drama company, established in 1756. In the 19th century, Maly was "universally recognized in Russia as the leading dramatic theatre of the century", and was the home stage for Mikhail Shchepkin and Maria Yermolova. 40 of Alexander Ostrovsky's 54 plays premiered at Maly, and the theatre was known as The House of Ostrovsky. The Maly Theatre in Moscow and Alexandrinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg "to a great extent determined the development of Russian theatre during the 19th and 20th century".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Maly_Theatr.jpg/200px-Maly_Theatr.jpg
