89.6	F-number	F-number	In optics, the f-number (sometimes called focal ratio, f-ratio, f-stop, or relative aperture) of an optical system expresses the diameter of the entrance pupil in terms of the focal length of the lens; in simpler terms, the f-number is the focal length divided by the "effective" aperture diameter. It is a dimensionless number that is a quantitative measure of lens speed, an important concept in photography.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Aperture_diagram.svg/320px-Aperture_diagram.svg.png
