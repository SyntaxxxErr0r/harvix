1.10	Louisiana_wine	Louisiana wine	Louisiana wine refers to wine made from grapes grown in the U.S. state of Louisiana. Louisiana has never developed a significant wine industry despite strong historical, cultural, and culinary ties to France. The climate of Louisiana is extremely hot and humid, and viticulturists in the state face challenges of Pierce's disease, powdery mildew, and other grapevine diseases. There are four commercial wineries in Louisiana that collectively produce about 20,000 gallons (75,000 liters) of wine per year. A small portion of northeastern Louisiana is included in the Mississippi Delta AVA, a designated American Viticultural Area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Map_of_USA_LA.svg/220px-Map_of_USA_LA.svg.png
