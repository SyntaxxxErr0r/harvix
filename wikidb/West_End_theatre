The first permanent public playhouse, known simply as The Theatre, was constructed in 1576 in Shoreditch by James Burbage. It was soon joined by The Curtain. Both are known to have been used by William Shakespeare's company. In 1599, the timber from The Theatre was moved to Southwark, where it was used in building the Globe Theatre in a new theatre district formed, beyond the controls of the City corporation. These theatres were closed in 1642 during the interregnum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Lyceum_Theatre_1.jpg/200px-Lyceum_Theatre_1.jpg
