52.4	Richard_III_(play)	Richard III (play)	Richard III is a history play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in approximately 1591. It depicts the Machiavellian rise to power and subsequent short reign of Richard III of England. The play is grouped among the histories in the First Folio and is most often classified as such. Occasionally, however, as in the quarto edition, it is termed a tragedy. Richard III concludes Shakespeare's first tetralogy (also containing Henry VI parts 1â€“3).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Hogarth%2C_William_-_David_Garrick_as_Richard_III_-_1745.jpg/220px-Hogarth%2C_William_-_David_Garrick_as_Richard_III_-_1745.jpg
