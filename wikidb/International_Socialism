3.00	International_Socialism	Proletarian internationalism	Proletarian internationalism, sometimes referred to as international socialism, is a Marxist social class concept based on the view that capitalism is now a global system, and therefore the working class must act as a global class if it is to defeat it. Workers should struggle in solidarity with their fellow workers in other countries on the basis of a common class interest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Marx_color2.jpg/110px-Marx_color2.jpg
