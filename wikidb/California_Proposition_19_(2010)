80.8	California_Proposition_19_(2010)	California Proposition 19 (2010)	California Proposition 19 (also known as the Regulate, Control &amp; Tax Cannabis Act) was a ballot initiative on the November 2, 2010 statewide ballot. It was defeated, with 53.5% of California voters voting "No" and 46.5% voting "Yes." If passed, it would have legalized various marijuana-related activities, allowed local governments to regulate these activities, permitted local governments to impose and collect marijuana-related fees and taxes, and authorized various criminal and civil penalties. In March 2010, it qualified to be on the November statewide ballot. The proposition required a simple majority in order to pass, and would have taken effect the day after the election. Yes on 19 was the official advocacy group for the initiative and California Public Safety Institute: No On Proposition 19 was the official opposition group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Seal_of_California.svg/180px-Seal_of_California.svg.png
