73.2	Complex_number	Complex number	A complex number is a number which can be put in the form , where and are real numbers and is called the imaginary unit, where . In this expression, is called the real part and the imaginary part of the complex number. Complex numbers extend the idea of the one-dimensional number line to the two-dimensional complex plane by using the horizontal axis for the real part and the vertical axis for the imaginary part. The complex number can be identified with the point . A complex number whose real part is zero is said to be purely imaginary, whereas a complex number whose imaginary part is zero is a real number. In this way the complex numbers contain the ordinary real numbers while extending them in order to solve problems that cannot be solved with only real numbers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Complex_number_illustration.svg/220px-Complex_number_illustration.svg.png
