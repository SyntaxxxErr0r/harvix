2.00	Fleet_Fawn	Fleet Fawn	In the 1930s, Fleet Aircraft manufactured a series of single-engined, two-seat training aircraft, based on US designs. The Fleet Model 7B and Model 7C, known respectively as Fawn I and Fawn II were purchased by the RCAF as primary trainers. After years of reliable service, many were available for use in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan during the Second World War while others remained as station "hacks."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Fleet_Fawn_at_museum.jpg/300px-Fleet_Fawn_at_museum.jpg
