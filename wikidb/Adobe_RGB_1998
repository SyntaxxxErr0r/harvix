1.00	Adobe_RGB_1998	Adobe RGB color space	The Adobe RGB color space is an RGB color space developed by Adobe Systems in 1998. It was designed to encompass most of the colors achievable on CMYK color printers, but by using RGB primary colors on a device such as the computer display. The Adobe RGB color space encompasses roughly 50% of the visible colors specified by the Lab color space, improving upon the gamut of the sRGB color space primarily in cyan-greens.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/CIExy1931_AdobeRGB.png/325px-CIExy1931_AdobeRGB.png
