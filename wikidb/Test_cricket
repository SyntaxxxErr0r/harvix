57.4	Test_cricket	Test cricket	Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket. Test matches are played between national representative teams with "Test status", as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC), with four innings played between two teams of 11 players over a period of up to a maximum five days. It is generally considered the ultimate test of playing ability and endurance in the sport. The origin of the name test stems from the fact that the long, grueling match is a "test" of the relative strength of the two sides.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/England_vs_South_Africa.jpg/300px-England_vs_South_Africa.jpg
