1.10	Teenage_Love	Teenage Love	Teenage Love is a compilation album by Australian pub rock band Cold Chisel, released in 1994. The album collected studio recordings, many just demos, that were not used on previous albums. Phil Small said, "There was always a surplus of 3 to 4 tracks with each album." The tracks were recorded between 1976 and 1983. "Hands Out of My Pocket", "Nothing But You" and "Yesterdays" were issued as singles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/Cold_chisel_teenage_love.jpg
