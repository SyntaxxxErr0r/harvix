3.10	Greatest_Hits_Live_(Heart_album)	Greatest Hits Live (Heart album)	Greatest Hits/Live is a compilation album released in 1980 by hard rock band Heart. The album, their sixth album overall, was a collection of the band's most famous songs, along with two new singles; covers of "Tell It Like It Is", and "Unchained Melody". Despite being a single, "Unchained Melody", was left off the compact disc version of the album due to initial limitations in CD technology, even though the total album running time would now be easily accommodated on a single disc. Similarly, the original vinyl version also contained two more cuts, "Hit Single", a giddy and sometimes maniacal hodgepodge of voices (Ann, Nancy and others) and sounds that seemed to be culled from recording studio outtakes, followed by an even giddier but non-typical Heart dance number entitled "Strange Euphoria" (named after the group's publishing company).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b0/Greatesthitslive.jpg/220px-Greatesthitslive.jpg
