84.5	NP-complete	NP-complete	In computational complexity theory, the complexity class NP-complete (abbreviated NP-C or NPC) is a class of decision problems. A decision problem L is NP-complete if it is in the set of NP problems so that any given solution to the decision problem can be verified in polynomial time, and also in the set of NP-hard problems so that any NP problem can be converted into L by a transformation of the inputs in polynomial time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/P_np_np-complete_np-hard.svg/300px-P_np_np-complete_np-hard.svg.png
