7.04	Junction_box	Junction box	An electrical junction box is a container for electrical connections, usually intended to conceal them from sight and meter tampering. A small metal or plastic junction box may form part of an electrical conduit wiring system in a building, or may be buried in the plaster of a wall, concealed behind an access panel or cast into concrete with only the lid showing. It sometimes includes terminals for joining wires. A similar container used for joining wires to electrical switches or sockets is called a pattress.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Junction_box.jpg/220px-Junction_box.jpg
