155.4	Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change	Scientific opinion on climate change	Scientific opinion on climate change is that the Earth's climate system is unequivocally warming and it is more than 90% certain that humans are causing it through activities that increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels. This scientific consensus is expressed in synthesis reports, scientific bodies of national or international standing, and surveys of opinion among climate scientists. Individual scientists, universities, and laboratories contribute to the overall scientific opinion via their peer-reviewed publications, and the areas of collective agreement and relative certainty are summarised in these high level reports and surveys.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Global_Temperature_Anomaly_1880-2010_%28Fig.A%29.gif/220px-Global_Temperature_Anomaly_1880-2010_%28Fig.A%29.gif
