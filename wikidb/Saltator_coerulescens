2.00	Saltator_coerulescens	Greyish Saltator	The Greyish Saltator is a seed-eating songbird that is widespread in the tropical Americas. Traditionally placed in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae), the saltators actually seem to be closer to the tanagers (Thraupidae). In El Salvador, it is well known as dichosofui after the "elaborate" version of its call, which sounds like a drawn-out Â¡dichoso fui!, Spanish for "I was happy!"	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Saltator_coerulescens_-Santa_Domingo%2C_Costa_Rica-8.jpg/220px-Saltator_coerulescens_-Santa_Domingo%2C_Costa_Rica-8.jpg
