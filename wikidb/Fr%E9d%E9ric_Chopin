A renowned child-prodigy pianist and composer, Chopin grew up in Warsaw and completed his music education there; he composed many mature works in Warsaw before leaving Poland in 1830 at age 20, shortly before the November 1830 Uprising.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Chopin%2C_by_Wodzinska.JPG/250px-Chopin%2C_by_Wodzinska.JPG
