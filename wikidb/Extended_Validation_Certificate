97.8	Extended_Validation_Certificate	Extended Validation Certificate	An Extended Validation Certificate (EV) is an X.509 public key certificate issued according to a specific set of identity verification criteria. These criteria require extensive verification of the requesting entity's identity by the certificate authority (CA) before a certificate is issued. Certificates issued by a CA under the EV guidelines are not structurally different from other certificates (and hence provide no stronger cryptography than other, cheaper certificates), but are designated with a CA-specific policy identifier so that EV-aware software can recognize them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Extendedvalidation.PNG/220px-Extendedvalidation.PNG
