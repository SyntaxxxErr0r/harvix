30.57	Animal_communication	Animal communication	Animal communication is any behavior on the part of one animal that has an effect on the current or future behaviour of another animal. The study of animal communication — sometimes called Zoosemiotics (defined as the study of sign communication or semiosis in animals; distinguishable from anthroposemiotics, the study of human communication) — has played an important part in the methodology of ethology, sociobiology, and the study of animal cognition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Dogs_roughhousing_by_David_Shankbone.jpg/220px-Dogs_roughhousing_by_David_Shankbone.jpg
