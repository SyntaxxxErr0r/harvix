4.11	Palau_Islands	Palau	Palau , officially the Republic of Palau (Palauan: ), is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean, 500 miles (800 km) east of the Philippines and 2,000 miles (3,200 km) south of Tokyo. In 1978, after three decades as being part of the United Nations trusteeship, Palau chose independence instead of becoming part of the Federated States of Micronesia; a Compact of Free Association was approved in 1986 but not ratified until 1993. It was put into force the following year, making it one of the world's youngest and smallest sovereign states. In English, the name is sometimes spelled Belau in accordance with the native pronunciation. It was formerly also spelled Pelew.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Flag_of_Palau.svg/125px-Flag_of_Palau.svg.png
