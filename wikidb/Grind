12.71	Grind	Grind	The grind of a blade refers to the shape of the cross-section of the blade. It is distinct from the type of blade (e.g., clip point or drop point knife, sabre or cutlass, axe or chisel, etc.), though different tools and blades may have lent their name to a particular grind.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Grind_stone.JPG/300px-Grind_stone.JPG
