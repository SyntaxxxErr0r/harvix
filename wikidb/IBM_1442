2.10	IBM_1442	IBM 1442	IBM 1442 was a combination IBM card reader and card punch. It read and punched 80-column IBM-format punched cards and was used on the IBM 1440, the IBM 1130, the IBM 1800 and System/360 and was an option on the IBM System/3. The 1442 could read up to 400 cards per minute. Cards were read and punched one column at a time and binary cards were permitted. Cards were read using photocells, illuminated by fiber optics, unlike the IBM 1402, which still used wire brushes to read cards. It was even possible to create (but not read) "IBM Doilies," cards with every possible hole punched. Few other pieces of IBM equipment could do this without sustaining damage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/IBM1442.corestore.jpg/280px-IBM1442.corestore.jpg
