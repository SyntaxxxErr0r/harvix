78.0	Strategy_pattern	Strategy pattern	In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a particular software design pattern, whereby algorithms can be selected at runtime. Formally speaking, the strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/StrategyPatternClassDiagram.svg/400px-StrategyPatternClassDiagram.svg.png
