103.2	Blue_Ocean_Strategy	Blue Ocean Strategy	Blue Ocean Strategy is a business strategy book first published in 2005 and written by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne of The Blue Ocean Strategy Institute at INSEAD. The book illustrates what the authors believe is the high growth and profits an organization can generate by creating new demand in an uncontested market space, or a "Blue Ocean", rather than by competing head-to-head with other suppliers for known customers in an existing industry.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a3/BOStrategy.jpg/185px-BOStrategy.jpg
