73.4	Octopus_card	Octopus card	The Octopus card is a rechargeable contactless stored value smart card used to transfer electronic payments in online or offline systems in Hong Kong. Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory's mass transit system, the Octopus card system is the second contactless smart card system in the world, after Upass, and has since grown into a widely used payment system for virtually all public transport in Hong Kong.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2b/PersonalisedOctopusCard.jpg/260px-PersonalisedOctopusCard.jpg
