69.5	Tristan_Tzara	Tristan Tzara	Tristan Tzara (French pronunciation: ; Romanian pronunciation: ; born Samuel or Samy Rosenstock, also known as S. Samyro; April 16 1896 â€“ December 25, 1963) was a Romanian and French avant-garde poet, essayist and performance artist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the anti-establishment Dada movement. Under the influence of Adrian Maniu, the adolescent Tzara became interested in Symbolism and co-founded the magazine Simbolul with Ion Vinea (with whom he also wrote experimental poetry) and painter Marcel Janco. During World War I, after briefly collaborating on Vinea's Chemarea, he joined Janco in Switzerland. There, Tzara's shows at the Cabaret Voltaire and Zunfthaus zur Waag, as well as his poetry and art manifestos, became a main feature of early Dadaism. His work represented Dada's nihilistic side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by Hugo Ball.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Robert_Delaunay_-_Tzara.jpg/210px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Tzara.jpg
