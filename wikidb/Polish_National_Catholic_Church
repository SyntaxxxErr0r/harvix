13.81	Polish_National_Catholic_Church	Polish National Catholic Church	The Polish National Catholic Church (PNCC) is a Christian church founded and based in the United States by Polish-Americans who were Roman Catholic. The PNCC is a breakaway Catholic Church in dialogue with the Catholic Church; it seeks full communion with the Holy See although it differs theologically in several important respects. The Polish National Catholic Church welcomes people of all ethnic, racial and social backgrounds. A sister church in Poland, likewise not in communion with the Catholic Church, is the Polish Catholic Church.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Ststanislauscathedral.JPG/220px-Ststanislauscathedral.JPG
