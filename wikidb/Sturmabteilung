118.7	Sturmabteilung	Sturmabteilung	The SA was the first Nazi paramilitary group to develop pseudo-military titles for bestowal upon its members. The SA ranks were adopted by several other Nazi Party groups, chief amongst them the SS, itself originally a branch of the SA. Brown-coloured shirts were chosen as the SA uniform because a large batch of them were cheaply available after World War I, having originally been ordered during the war for colonial troops posted to Germany's former African colonies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/SA-Logo.svg/100px-SA-Logo.svg.png
