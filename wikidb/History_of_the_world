52.4	History_of_the_world	History of the world	The history of the world or human history is the history of humanity from the earliest times to the present, in all places on Earth, beginning with the Paleolithic Era. It excludes non-human natural history and geological history, except insofar as the natural world substantially affects human lives. World history encompasses the study of written records, from ancient times forward, plus additional knowledge gained from other sources, such as archaeology. Ancient recorded history begins with the invention, independently at several sites on Earth, of writing, which created the infrastructure for lasting, accurately transmitted memories and thus for the diffusion and growth of knowledge. However, the roots of civilization reach back to the period before writing â€” humanity's prehistory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Lascaux_04.jpg/220px-Lascaux_04.jpg
