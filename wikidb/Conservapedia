55.7	Conservapedia	Conservapedia	Conservapedia is an English-language wiki encyclopedia project written from a self-described American conservative, Christian, and predominantly creationist point of view. According to the site's operators, the site "strives to keep its articles concise, informative, family-friendly, and true to the facts, which often back up conservative ideas more than liberal ones." It was started in 2006 by homeschool teacher and attorney Andrew Schlafly, son of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, to counter what he called the liberal bias of Wikipedia. It uses editorials and a wiki-based system to generate content. Examples of the ideology of Conservapedia in its articles include: accusations against US President Barack Obama, criticism of Wikipedia's supposed liberal bias, criticism of the theory of relativity as promoting moral relativism, claiming a proven link between abortion and breast cancer and asserting that the goals of a so-called homosexual agenda include indoctrination. Conservapedia also operates a Conservative Bible Project, which aims to crowd-source a translation of the Bible which will be "free of corruption by liberal untruths".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Conservlogo4.png
