36.04	Parabolic_trough	Parabolic trough	A parabolic trough is a type of solar thermal energy collector. It is constructed as a long parabolic mirror (usually coated silver or polished aluminum) with a Dewar tube running its length at the focal point. Sunlight is reflected by the mirror and concentrated on the Dewar tube. The trough is usually aligned on a north-south axis, and rotated to track the sun as it moves across the sky each day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Solar_troughs_in_the_Negev_desert_of_Israel.jpg/244px-Solar_troughs_in_the_Negev_desert_of_Israel.jpg
