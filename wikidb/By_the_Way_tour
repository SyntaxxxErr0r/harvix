1.00	By_the_Way_tour	By the Way tour	The By the Way tour was a worldwide concert tour by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers to support the band's eighth studio album, By the Way. The band was at a commercial peak, having only been off the road for a short amount of time after touring in support of their 1999, best-selling Californication. The band began writing their next album in early 2001, and released By the Way over a year later, on July 9, 2002.
