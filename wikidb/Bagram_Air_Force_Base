4.01	Bagram_Air_Force_Base	Bagram Airfield	Bagram Airfield, also referred to as Bagram Air Base, is one of the largest U.S. military bases in Afghanistan. It comes with a dual-runway militarized airport and is located next to the ancient city of Bagram, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) southeast of Charikar in Parwan province of Afghanistan. The base is run by a U.S. Army division headed by a major general. However, a large part of it is "owned" by the United States Air Force (455th Air Expeditionary Wing). The area under Air Force control (about half of the overall base) includes the flight line, the ramp, and most of the area involving air mission resources.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/070520-Bagram_Airfield_from_the_Air_Traffic_Control_Tower%27s_catwalk_3.jpg/220px-070520-Bagram_Airfield_from_the_Air_Traffic_Control_Tower%27s_catwalk_3.jpg
