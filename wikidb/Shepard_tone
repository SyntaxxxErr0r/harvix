58.0	Shepard_tone	Shepard tone	A Shepard tone, named after Roger Shepard, is a sound consisting of a superposition of sine waves separated by octaves. When played with the base pitch of the tone moving upward or downward, it is referred to as the Shepard scale. This creates the auditory illusion of a tone that continually ascends or descends in pitch, yet which ultimately seems to get no higher or lower. It has been described as a "sonic barber's pole".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Shepard_Tones_spectrum_linear_scale.png/150px-Shepard_Tones_spectrum_linear_scale.png
