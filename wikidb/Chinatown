63.1	Chinatown	Chinatown	A Chinatown is an ethnic enclave of expatriate Chinese people, although it is often generalized to include various Southeast Asian people. Chinatowns exist throughout the world, including Africa, East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Americas, Australasia, and Europe. Binondo's Chinatown located in Manila, Philippines is the oldest Chinatown, established in 1594. Many Chinatowns are considered significant centers of commerce and tourism, while some also serve, to varying degrees, as centers of multiculturalism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Archchinesejf.JPG/220px-Archchinesejf.JPG
