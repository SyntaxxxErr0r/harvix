65.9	Mary_Poppins	Mary Poppins	Mary Poppins is a series of children's books written by the Australian novelist P. L. Travers. Throughout the Mary Poppins series, Mary Shepard was the illustrator, and acted as a second author. . The books centre on a magical English nanny, Mary Poppins. She is blown by the East wind to Number Seventeen Cherry Tree Lane, London, and into the Banks' household to care for their children. Encounters with chimney sweeps, shopkeepers and various adventures follow until Mary Poppins abruptly leaves, i.e., "pops-out". The adventures take place over a total of eight books. However, only the first three books feature Mary Poppins arriving and leaving. The later five books recount previously unrecorded adventures from her original three visits. As P.L. Travers explains in her introduction to Mary Poppins in the Park, "She cannot forever arrive and depart."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Poppinsfirst4.jpg/200px-Poppinsfirst4.jpg
