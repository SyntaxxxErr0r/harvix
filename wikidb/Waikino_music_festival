2.00	Waikino_music_festival	Waikino music festival	Waikino Music Festival was a 1977 music and alternatives event held on Bicknellâ€™s farm in the picturesque Waitawheta Valley between Waikino and Waihi, New Zealand. The event was staged as a forerunner to the Nambassa festivals and was a community project run by Peter Terry. The Waikino festival was originally intended as an eight hour all day music and cultural event, however, a steady flow of bands, buskers and poets from around Auckland and the Waikato spontaneously rocked up to perform. Consequently the event ran non stop for 24 hours and attracted 5000 patrons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Waikinos_all_day_Music_festival_1976.jpg/200px-Waikinos_all_day_Music_festival_1976.jpg
