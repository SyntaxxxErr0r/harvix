4.20	Eurasian_steppe	Eurasian Steppe	The Eurasian Steppe (also called The Steppe or The Steppes) is the vast steppe ecoregion of Eurasia in the Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands Biome. It stretches from Romania through the Ukraine to Siberia with one major enclave located mostly in Hungary called Puszta. The steppe has connected Europe, Central Asia, China, South Asia, and the Middle East economically, politically, and culturally through overland trade routes, most notably the Silk Road during Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and the Eurasian Land Bridge in the modern era.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/AltynEmeil.jpg/220px-AltynEmeil.jpg
