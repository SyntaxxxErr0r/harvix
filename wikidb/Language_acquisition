52.7	Language_acquisition	Language acquisition	Language acquisition is the process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend language, as well as to produce and use words to communicate. The capacity to successfully use language requires one to acquire a range of tools including syntax, phonetics, and an extensive vocabulary. This language might be vocalized as with speech or manual as in sign. Language acquisition usually refers to first language acquisition, which studies infants' acquisition of their native language. This is distinguished from second language acquisition, which deals with the acquisition (in both children and adults) of additional languages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Languages_world_map-transparent_background.svg/150px-Languages_world_map-transparent_background.svg.png
