It was founded by royal charter in 1827 as King's College, the first institution of higher learning in Upper Canada. Originally controlled by the Church of England, the university assumed the present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a collegiate university, it comprises twelve colleges that differ in character and history, each retaining substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/04/Utoronto_coa.svg/175px-Utoronto_coa.svg.png
