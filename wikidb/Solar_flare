95.2	Solar_flare	Solar flare	A solar flare is a sudden brightening observed over the Sun surface or the solar limb, which is interpreted as a large energy release of up to 6 × 1025 joules of energy (about a sixth of the total energy output of the Sun each second) or 160,000,000,000 megatons of TNT equivalent, over 25,000 times more energy released from the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter. The flare ejects clouds of electrons, ions, and atoms through the corona into space. These clouds typically reach Earth a day or two after the event. The term is also used to refer to similar phenomena in other stars, where the term stellar flare applies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Flare_and_after-flare_prominence.jpg/170px-Flare_and_after-flare_prominence.jpg
