8.11	Race_for_the_Galaxy	Race for the Galaxy	Race for the Galaxy (also abbreviated "RftG" or simply "Race") is a card game designed by Thomas Lehmann that was released in 2007 by Rio Grande Games. Its theme is to build galactic civilizations via game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments. It accommodates 2-4 players by default although expansions allow for up to 6 players, as well as solo play. The game uses iconography in place of language. While appreciated by experienced players for being concise, some new players find the icons difficult to learn and decipher.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1c/Rftg_cover.jpg/220px-Rftg_cover.jpg
