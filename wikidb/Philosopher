98.9	Philosopher	Philosophy	Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument. The word "philosophy" comes from the Greek φιλοσοφία , which literally means "love of wisdom".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/Philbar.png/158px-Philbar.png
