The Strip borders Egypt on the southwest, 11km long, and Israel on the east and north, 51km long. It is about 41 kilometres (25 mi) long, and between 6 and 12 kilometres (4â€“7.5 mi) wide, with a total area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi). It has a 40 km coastline onto the Mediterranean Sea, but has no maritime claims due to Israeli administration. The territory takes its name from Gaza-city, its main city and administrative center.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/GazaStripGovernatesNonLabeled.svg/220px-GazaStripGovernatesNonLabeled.svg.png
