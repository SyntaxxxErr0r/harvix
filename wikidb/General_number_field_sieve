30.21	General_number_field_sieve	General number field sieve	Suppose f is an n-degree polynomial over Q (the rational numbers), and r is a complex root of f. Then, f = 0, which can be rearranged to express rn as a linear combination of powers of r less than n. This equation can be used to reduce away any powers of r ≥ n. For example, if f(x) = x2 + 1 and r is the imaginary unit i, then i2 + 1=0, or i2 = −1. This allows us to define the complex product:
