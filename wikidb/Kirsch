58.6	Kirsch	Kirsch	Kirschwasser (English pronunciation: -vahs-ər, German: , German for “cherry water”) is a clear, colorless fruit brandy traditionally made from double distillation of morello cherries, a dark-colored cultivar of the sour cherry. However, it is now also made from other kinds of cherries. The cherries are fermented complete (that is, including their stones). Unlike cherry liqueurs and so-called “cherry brandies,” Kirschwasser is not sweet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Fuersteneck_Kirschwasser.jpg/225px-Fuersteneck_Kirschwasser.jpg
