57.5	Gray_Wolf	Gray wolf	The gray wolf, grey wolf, or common wolf is the largest extant member of the dog family of mammals, the Canidae. The species was the world's most widely distributed mammal but has become extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the contiguous United States. Wolves occur primarily but not exclusively in wilderness and remote areas. Their original worldwide range has been reduced by about one-third by deliberate persecution due to depredation on livestock and fear of attacks on humans. Although the species still faces some threats, it is relatively widespread with a stable population trend and has therefore been assessed as Least Concern by IUCN since 2004.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Kolm%C3%A5rden_Wolf.jpg/220px-Kolm%C3%A5rden_Wolf.jpg
