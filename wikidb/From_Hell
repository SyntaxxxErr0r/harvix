66.1	From_Hell	From Hell	From Hell is a comic book series by writer Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell, originally published from 1991 to 1996, speculating upon the identity and motives of Jack the Ripper. The title is taken from the first words of the "From Hell" letter, which some authorities believe was an authentic message sent from the killer in 1888. The collected edition is 572 pages long. The 2000 and later editions are the most common prints. The comic was adapted into a film of the same title, released in 2001.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/From_hell_tpb.jpg
