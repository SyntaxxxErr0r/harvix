1.20	Antiballistic_missile	Anti-ballistic missile	An anti-ballistic missile is a missile designed to counter ballistic missiles (a missile for missile defense). A ballistic missile is used to deliver nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional warheads in a ballistic flight trajectory. The term "anti-ballistic missile" describes any antimissile system designed to counter ballistic missiles. However the term is used more commonly for systems designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/SM-3-launch-USS_Shiloh-20060622.jpg/220px-SM-3-launch-USS_Shiloh-20060622.jpg
