3.00	English_language_learner	English-language learner	An English-language learner (often capitalized as English-Language Learner or abbreviated to ELL) is a person who is learning the English language in addition to their native language. This can refer to any learners of English as a foreign or second language, but more often the term is used to refer to learners of English as a second language in mainstream schools where English is the language of instruction. The instruction and assessment of students, their cultural background, and the attitudes of classroom teachers towards ELLs have all been found to be factors in ELL student achievement. Some ways that have been suggested to assist ELLs include bringing their home cultures into the classroom, involving them in language-appropriate content-area instruction from the beginning, and by integrating literature into the learning program.
