1.00	Cutworms	Cutworm	Cutworms are not worms, biologically speaking, but caterpillars; they are moth larvae that hide under litter or soil during the day, coming out in the dark to feed on plants. A larva typically attacks the first part of the plant it encounters, namely the stem, often of a seedling, and consequently cuts it down; hence the name cutworm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Neil_Phillips_-_Large_Yellow_Underwing_caterpiller_%28by%29.jpg/220px-Neil_Phillips_-_Large_Yellow_Underwing_caterpiller_%28by%29.jpg
