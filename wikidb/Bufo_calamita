1.00	Bufo_calamita	Natterjack Toad	The Natterjack Toad is a toad native to sandy and heathland areas of Europe. Adults are 60â€“70 mm in length and are distinguished from Common Toads by a yellow line down the middle of the back. They have relatively short legs, and this gives them a distinctive gait, contrasting with the hopping movement of many other toad species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/BufoCalamita_Sand.jpg/250px-BufoCalamita_Sand.jpg
