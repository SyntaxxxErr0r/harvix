6.20	Kissy_Suzuki	Kissy Suzuki	Kissy Suzuki is a fictional character in Ian Fleming's 1964 James Bond novel, You Only Live Twice. Despite Bond's womanizing, Kissy Suzuki (at least the literary version) remains the only character known to the reader who bears a child by him. She is also one of the few known Bond girls (also in literature) to have died as a result of a non-violent, natural death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/98/MieHama_as_KissySuzuki.jpg/200px-MieHama_as_KissySuzuki.jpg
