3.00	Marc-Amable_Girard	Marc-Amable Girard	Marc-Amable Girard (April 25, 1822 â€“ September 12, 1892) was the second Premier of the Western Canadian province of Manitoba, and the first Franco-Manitoban to hold that post. The Canadian Parliamentary Guide lists Girard as having been Premier (or Chief Minister) from 1871 to 1872, but he did not have this title at the time and was not the government leader. In 1874, however, Girard led Manitoba's first ministry to be constituted on principles of "responsible government". In this sense, he may be regarded as the first Premier of Manitoba.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Marc-Amable_Girard.jpg
