7.20	Dying_Earth_(subgenre)	Dying Earth (subgenre)	The Dying Earth subgenre is a sub-category of science fiction or science fantasy which takes place in the far future at either the end of life on Earth or the End of Time, when the laws of the universe themselves fail. Themes of world-weariness, innocence (wounded or otherwise), idealism, entropy, (permanent) exhaustion/depletion of many or all resources (such as soil nutrients), and the hope of renewal tend to pre-dominate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/The_dying_earth_by_jack_vance.jpg/150px-The_dying_earth_by_jack_vance.jpg
