118.8	Charles_Shaw_wine	Charles Shaw wine	Charles Shaw is a brand of "extreme value" wine (bargain-priced premium wine). Largely made from California grapes, Charles Shaw wines currently include Cabernet Sauvignon, White Zinfandel, Merlot, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Shiraz, Valdiguie in the style of Beaujolais nouveau, and limited quantities of Pinot Grigio. These wines were introduced exclusively at Trader Joe's grocery stores in California at a price of $1.99 per bottle, earning the wines the nickname "Two Buck Chuck." In 2009, an international version of Chardonnay from Australia was introduced in limited stores.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/Two_buck_chuck_display.jpg/300px-Two_buck_chuck_display.jpg
