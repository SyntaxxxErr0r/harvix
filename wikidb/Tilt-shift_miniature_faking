69.7	Tilt-shift_miniature_faking	Miniature faking	Diorama effect or "diorama illusion" is a process in which a photograph of a life-size location or object is made to look like a photograph of a miniature scale model. Blurring parts of the photo simulates the shallow depth of field normally encountered in close-up photography, making the scene seem much smaller than it actually is; the blurring can be done either optically when the photograph is taken, or by digital postprocessing. Many diorama effect photographs are taken from a high angle to simulate the effect of looking down on a miniature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Jodhpur_tilt_shift.jpg/220px-Jodhpur_tilt_shift.jpg
