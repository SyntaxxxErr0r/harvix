54.1	Mycelium	Mycelium	Mycelium (plural mycelia) is the vegetative part of a fungus, consisting of a mass of branching, thread-like hyphae. The mass of hyphae is sometimes called shiro, especially within the fairy ring fungi. Fungal colonies composed of mycelia are found in soil and on or within many other substrates. A typical single spore germinates into a homokaryotic mycelium, which cannot reproduce sexually; when two compatible homokaryotic mycelia join and form a dikaryotic mycelium, that mycelium may form fruiting bodies such as mushrooms. A mycelium may be minute, forming a colony that is too small to see, or it may be extensive:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Mushroom%27s_roots_%28myc%C3%A9lium%29.jpg/220px-Mushroom%27s_roots_%28myc%C3%A9lium%29.jpg
