4.11	Earthen_floor	Earthen floor	An earthen floor, also called an adobe floor, is a floor made of dirt, raw earth, or other unworked ground materials. It is usually constructed, in modern times, with a mixture of sand, finely chopped straw and clay, mixed to a thickened consistency and spread with a trowel on a sub-surface such as concrete. Once dry, it is then usually saturated with several treatments of a drying oil.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Urthinflur.JPG/200px-Urthinflur.JPG
