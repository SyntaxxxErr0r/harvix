102.8	The_Troubles	The Troubles	The Troubles (Irish: ) was a period of ethno-political conflict in Northern Ireland which spilled over at various times into England, the Republic of Ireland, and mainland Europe. The duration of the Troubles is conventionally dated from the late 1960s and considered by many to have ended with the Belfast "Good Friday" Agreement of 1998. However, sporadic violence has been ongoing since then.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/225px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG
