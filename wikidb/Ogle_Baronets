1.00	Ogle_Baronets	Ogle Baronets	The Ogle Baronetcy, of Worthy, was a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 12 March 1816 for Admiral Chaloner Ogle, of Kings Worthy, Hampshire. The Ogles were a prominent Northumberland family from before the time of the Norman Conquest. They settled at Ogle, Northumberland and in 1341 were granted licence to fortify their manor house, which became known as Ogle Castle. In the 14th and 15th centuries the family included seven medieval Barons (see Baron Ogle). Their estates including Ogle and Bothal Castle fell by marriage to the Cavendish family ( later Dukes of Portland) on the death of the 7th and last Baron, without male heir in 1597.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Lady_OGLE%2C_Nord_de_Waterloo%2C_Brussels%2C_1856_%28cm_18%2C5_x_25%2C5%29.JPG/200px-Lady_OGLE%2C_Nord_de_Waterloo%2C_Brussels%2C_1856_%28cm_18%2C5_x_25%2C5%29.JPG
