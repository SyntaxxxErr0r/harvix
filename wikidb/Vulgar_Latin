56.3	Vulgar_Latin	Vulgar Latin	Vulgar Latin (in Renaissance Latin, vulgare Latinum or Latinum vulgare) is any of the nonstandard forms of Latin from which the Romance languages developed. Because of its nonstandard nature, it had no official orthography. All written works used Classical Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' Satyricon). It is sometimes also called colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Rome_Colosseum_inscription_2.jpg/200px-Rome_Colosseum_inscription_2.jpg
