2.00	Harada-Ito_procedure	Harada-Ito procedure	The Harada-Ito procedure is an eye muscle operation designed to improve the excyclotorsion experienced by some patients with cranial nerve IV palsy. In this procedure, the superior oblique tendon is split, and the anterior fibers -- the fibers most responsible for incyclotorsion -- are moved anteriorly and laterally. This selectively stretches and tightens these fibers, enhancing the incyclotorsion power of the superior oblique.
