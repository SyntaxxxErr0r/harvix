80.1	Anzac_Day	Anzac Day	Anzac Day is a national day of remembrance in Australia and New Zealand, commemorated by both countries on 25 April every year to honour the members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who fought at Gallipoli in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. It now more broadly commemorates all those who died and served in military operations for their countries. Anzac Day is also observed in the Cook Islands, Niue, and Tonga. It is no longer observed as a national holiday in Samoa.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Dawn_service_gnangarra_03.jpg/225px-Dawn_service_gnangarra_03.jpg
