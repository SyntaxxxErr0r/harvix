45.63	82nd_Academy_Awards	82nd Academy Awards	The 82nd Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored the best films of 2009 and took place March 7, 2010, at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles beginning at 5:30 p.m. PST / 8:30 p.m. EST. The ceremony was scheduled well after its usual late-February date to avoid conflicting with the 2010 Winter Olympics. During the ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony was televised in the United States by ABC. Actors Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin hosted the show. Martin hosted for the third time, having presided over the 73rd and 75th ceremonies, while Baldwin hosted the show for the first time. This was the first telecast to have multiple hosts since the 59th ceremony.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/82nd_Academy_Awards_poster.jpg/220px-82nd_Academy_Awards_poster.jpg
