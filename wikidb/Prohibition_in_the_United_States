155.6	Prohibition_in_the_United_States	Prohibition in the United States	Prohibition in the United States was a national ban on the sale, manufacture, and transportation of alcohol, in place from 1919 to 1933. The ban was mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and the Volstead Act set down the rules for enforcing the ban, as well as defining the types of alcoholic beverages that were prohibited. Prohibition ended with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment, on December 5, 1933.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Detroit_police_prohibition.jpg/250px-Detroit_police_prohibition.jpg
