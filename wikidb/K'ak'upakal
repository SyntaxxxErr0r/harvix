1.00	K'ak'upakal	K'ak'upakal	K'ak'upakal, or possibly K'ak'upakal K'awiil (fl. ca. 869–890) was a ruler or high ranking officeholder at the pre-Columbian Maya site of Chichen Itza, during the latter half of the 9th century CE. The name of this ruler, alternatively written K'ahk'upakal, K'ak' Upakal or K'ak'-u-pakal, is the most widely mentioned personal name in the surviving Maya inscriptions at Chichen Itza, and also appears on monumental inscriptions at other Yucatán Peninsula sites such as Uxmal. This 9th-century personage may also be the same individual with this name mentioned in some later ethnohistorical sources, such as the books of Chilam Balam.
