83.7	La_Ni%C3%B1a	La Niña	La Niña is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that is the counterpart of El Niño as part of the broader El Niño-Southern Oscillation climate pattern. During a period of La Niña, the sea surface temperature across the equatorial Eastern Central Pacific Ocean will be lower than normal by 3–5 °C. In the United States, an episode of La Niña is defined as a period of at least 5 months of La Niña conditions. The name La Niña originates from Spanish, meaning "the girl," analogous to El Niño meaning "the boy."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Sea_Surface_Temperature_-_November_2007.jpg/300px-Sea_Surface_Temperature_-_November_2007.jpg
