18.60	Windows_NT_3.51	Windows NT 3.51	Windows NT 3.51 is the third release of Microsoft's Windows NT line of operating systems. It was released on May 30, 1995, nine months after Windows NT 3.5. The release provided two notable feature improvements; firstly NT 3.51 was the first of a short-lived outing of Microsoft Windows on the PowerPC architecture. The second most significant enhancement offered through the release was that it provides client/server support for interoperating with Windows 95, which was released three months after NT 3.51. Windows NT 4.0 became its successor a year later; Microsoft continued to support 3.51 until 31 December 2001.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2e/Windows_NT_3.1_logo.svg/100px-Windows_NT_3.1_logo.svg.png
