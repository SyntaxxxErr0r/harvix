89.2	American_Civil_Liberties_Union	American Civil Liberties Union	The American Civil Liberties Union is a nonpartisan non-profit organization whose stated mission is "to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States." It works through litigation, lobbying, and community education. Founded in 1920 by Crystal Eastman, Roger Baldwin and Walter Nelles, the ACLU has over 500,000 members and has an annual budget over $100 million. Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases in which it considers civil liberties to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation, or preparation of amicus curiae briefs expressing legal arguments (when another law firm is already providing representation).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4d/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_logo.png/200px-American_Civil_Liberties_Union_logo.png
