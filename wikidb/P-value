73.8	P-value	P-value	In statistical significance testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In this context, value a is considered more "extreme" than b if a is less likely to occur under the null. One often "rejects the null hypothesis" when the p-value is less than the significance level Î± (Greek alpha), which is often 0.05 or 0.01. When the null hypothesis is rejected, the result is said to be statistically significant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/P_values.png/475px-P_values.png
