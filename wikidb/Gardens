18.22	Gardens	Garden	A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials. The most common form today is known as a residential garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one. Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens. Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Pieskowa_Ska%C5%82a_ogr%C3%B3d_zamkowy.jpg/220px-Pieskowa_Ska%C5%82a_ogr%C3%B3d_zamkowy.jpg
