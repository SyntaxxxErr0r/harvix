55.1	Stephen_Colbert_(character)	Stephen Colbert (character)	The Rev. Sir Dr. Stephen T. Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A. is the persona of political satirist Stephen Colbert, as portrayed on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report. Described as a "well-intentioned, poorly informed high-status idiot" and a "self-important right-wing commentator," the character incorporates aspects of the real Colbert's life and interests but is primarily a parody of cable news pundits, particularly Fox News' Bill O'Reilly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/Colbertreport.jpg/200px-Colbertreport.jpg
