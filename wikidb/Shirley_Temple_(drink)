1.00	Shirley_Temple_(drink)	Shirley Temple (cocktail)	A Shirley Temple (shir-ley tem-ple) is a non-alcoholic mixed drink made with two parts Ginger ale, one part orange juice, and a splash of grenadine, garnished with a maraschino cherry. More recent recipes omit the orange juice and instead combine equal parts lemon-lime soda and ginger ale. Many restaurants now serve a Shirley Temple as a mixture of lemon-lime soda, such as Sprite, and grenadine, with a cherry added in as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Canadia-style_Shirley_Temple.jpg/220px-Canadia-style_Shirley_Temple.jpg
