67.0	S-Video	S-Video	Separate Video, more commonly known as S-Video and Y/C, is an analog video transmission scheme, in which video information is encoded on two channels: luma (luminance, intensity, "Y") and chroma (colour, "C"). This separation is in contrast with lower-quality composite video, in which all video information is encoded on one channel, and higher-quality component video, in which video information is encoded on three channels. S-Video carries standard definition video (typically at 480i or 576i resolution), but does not carry audio on the same cable. It's often referred to by JVC (who introduced the DIN-connector pictured) as both an S-VHS connector and as Super Video.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/MiniDIN-4_Connector_Pinout.svg/170px-MiniDIN-4_Connector_Pinout.svg.png
