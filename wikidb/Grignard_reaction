12.41	Grignard_reaction	Grignard reaction	The Grignard reaction is an organometallic chemical reaction in which alkyl- or aryl-magnesium halides add to a carbonyl group in an aldehyde or ketone. This reaction is an important tool for the formation of carbonâ€“carbon bonds. The reaction of an organic halide with magnesium is not a Grignard reaction, but provides a Grignard reagent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Grignard_reaction_experiment_07.jpg/220px-Grignard_reaction_experiment_07.jpg
