83.6	Adsorption	Adsorption	Adsorption is the adhesion of atoms, ions, or molecules from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid to a surface. This process creates a film of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent. This process differs from absorption, in which a fluid (the absorbate) permeates or is dissolved by a liquid or solid (the absorbent). Note that adsorption is a surface-based process while absorption involves the whole volume of the material. The term sorption encompasses both processes, while desorption is the reverse of adsorption. It is a surface phenomenon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/BET_Multilayer_Adsorption.svg/220px-BET_Multilayer_Adsorption.svg.png
