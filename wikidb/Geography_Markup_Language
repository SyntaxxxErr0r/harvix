97.7	Geography_Markup_Language	Geography Markup Language	The Geography Markup Language is the XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to express geographical features. GML serves as a modeling language for geographic systems as well as an open interchange format for geographic transactions on the Internet. Note that the concept of feature in GML is a very general one and includes not only conventional "vector" or discrete objects, but also coverages (see also GMLJP2) and sensor data. The ability to integrate all forms of geographic information is key to the utility of GML.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Simple_vector_map.svg/250px-Simple_vector_map.svg.png
