16.23	Gongfu_tea_ceremony	Gongfu tea ceremony	The gongfu tea ceremony or kungfu tea ceremony , is a commercialized show based on the tea preparation approach originated probably in Fujian or Guangdong. The original term "Gongfu Cha (工夫茶)" literally means "making tea with efforts". Sometimes '功' instead of '工' is used thus 功夫茶. Today, the approach is used popularly by teashops carrying tea of Chinese or Taiwan origins, and by tea connoisseurs as a way to maximize the taste of a tea selection, especially a finer one. The "ceremony" show aspect has become an entertainment in various fairs, ceremonies and tourist programs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Gong_fu_cha.jpg/220px-Gong_fu_cha.jpg
