2.00	En_passante	En passant	En passant (from French: ) is a move in the board game of chess . It is a special pawn capture which can occur immediately after a player moves a pawn two squares forward from its starting position, and an enemy pawn could have captured it had it moved only one square forward. The opponent captures the just-moved pawn as if taking it "as it passes" through the first square. The resulting position is the same as if the pawn had moved only one square forward and the enemy pawn had captured normally.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Ajedrez_captura_al_paso_del_peon.png
