54.4	Nationalization	Nationalization	Nationalization, also spelled nationalisation, is the process of taking an industry or assets into government ownership by a national government or state. Nationalization usually refers to private assets, but may also mean assets owned by lower levels of government, such as municipalities, being transferred to the public sector to be operated and owned by the state. The opposite of nationalization is usually privatization or de-nationalization, but may also be municipalization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/D%C3%A9cret_de_nationalisation_des_locaux_de_couvent_Sainte-C%C3%A9cile_%281793%29_%28Nationalization_decree_affecting_the_premises_of_the_convent_of_Sainte-C%C3%A9cile%29%2C_Grenoble%2C_France.jpg/200px-D%C3%A9cret_de_nationalisation_des_locaux_de_couvent_Sainte-C%C3%A9cile_%281793%29_%28Nationalization_decree_affecting_the_premises_of_the_convent_of_Sainte-C%C3%A9cile%29%2C_Grenoble%2C_France.jpg
