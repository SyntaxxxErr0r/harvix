3.00	NL_Central	National League Central	The National League Central Division is one of Major League Baseball's six divisions. This division was created in 1994, by moving two teams from the Western Division (the Cincinnati Reds and the Houston Astros) and three teams from the Eastern Division (the Chicago Cubs, the Pittsburgh Pirates, and the St. Louis Cardinals) of the National League. In 1998, the Central Division became the largest division in Major League Baseball when the Milwaukee Brewers were moved in from the American League. In 2013, the Houston Astros will be moving to the American League West division as part of a realignment by Major League Baseball.
