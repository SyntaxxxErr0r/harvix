1.00	Peter_Fischli	Peter Fischli &amp; David Weiss	Peter Fischli (8 June 1952 in Zurich) and David Weiss (21 June 1946 in Zurich), often shortened to Fischli/Weiss, are an artist duo that have been collaborating since 1979. They are among the most renowned contemporary artists of Switzerland. Their best known work is the film "Der Lauf der Dinge (The Way Things Go)." This was described by The Guardian as being "post apocalyptic" as it is all about chain reactions and the way in which objects fly, crash, and explode across the studio it was shot in. Both artists live and work in Zurich.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1e/Still_from_the_way_things_go.jpg/220px-Still_from_the_way_things_go.jpg
