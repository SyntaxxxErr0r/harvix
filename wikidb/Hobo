57.2	Hobo	Hobo	A hobo is a migratory worker or homeless vagabond, especially one who is penniless. The term originated in the Western—probably Northwestern—United States during the last decade of the 19th century. Unlike 'tramps', who work only when they are forced to, and 'bums', who do not work at all, 'hobos' are workers who wander.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Hobos2.jpg/220px-Hobos2.jpg
