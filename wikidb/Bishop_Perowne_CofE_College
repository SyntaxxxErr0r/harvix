1.10	Bishop_Perowne_CofE_College	Bishop Perowne CofE College	Bishop Perowne CE College is a Church of England school in Worcester, Worcestershire, England. It is a co-educational school, secondary school with a capacity of 1,050 pupils aged between 11 and 16. The school is a specialist Performing Arts College and was the first Worcestershire school to take Specialist Performing Arts status in 2002. The school takes its name from two former Bishops of Worcester, John Perowne (Bishop from 1891 to 1901), and his son Arthur who was also Bishop of Worcester from 1931 to 1941. An Ofsted inspection in June 2009 awarded the school a Grade 3 (satisfactory). Although the school has been slow to address the examination needs of all the students, inspector Clive Kempton was particularly impressed with the strength of the students' Christian values, going on to say that the students "...are polite, well behaved and courteous to visitors and want to share how proud you are to go to Bishop Perowne." The school is popular and over subscribed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/08/Bishop_Perowne_Sch_logo.jpg/220px-Bishop_Perowne_Sch_logo.jpg
