74.7	Meister_Eckhart	Meister Eckhart	Eckhart von Hochheim O.P. (c. 1260 â€“ c. 1327), commonly known as Meister Eckhart, was a German theologian, philosopher and mystic, born near Gotha, in the Landgraviate of Thuringia in the Holy Roman Empire. Meister is German for "Master", referring to the academic title Magister in theologia he obtained in Paris. Coming into prominence during the Avignon Papacy and a time of increased tensions between the Franciscans and Eckhart's Dominican Order of Friars Preachers, he was brought up on charges later in life before the local Franciscan-led Inquisition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Meister-Ekkehard-Portal_der_Erfurter_Predigerkirche.jpg/220px-Meister-Ekkehard-Portal_der_Erfurter_Predigerkirche.jpg
