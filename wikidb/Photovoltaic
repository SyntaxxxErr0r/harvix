77.4	Photovoltaic	Photovoltaics	Photovoltaics is a method of generating electrical power by converting solar radiation into direct current electricity using semiconductors that exhibit the photovoltaic effect. Photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells containing a photovoltaic material. Materials presently used for photovoltaics include monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium gallium selenide/sulfide. Due to the growing demand for renewable energy sources, the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Nellis_AFB_Solar_panels.jpg/220px-Nellis_AFB_Solar_panels.jpg
