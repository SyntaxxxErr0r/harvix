3.01	Cierva_C.6	Cierva C.6	The Cierva C.6 was the sixth autogiro designed by engineer Juan de la Cierva, and the first one to travel a "major" distance. Cierva, the engineer responsible for the invention of the autogiro, had spent all his funds in the research and creation of his first five prototypes. So, in 1923, he turned to the Cuatro Vientos Aerodynamics Laboratory chief, Commander Emilio Herrera, who succeeded in persuading General Francisco Echag√ºe, the director of the Military Aviation Aeronautics Department, to take over the second stage in the research and development of Cierva's Autogiros.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/La_Cierva_C-6.jpeg/300px-La_Cierva_C-6.jpeg
