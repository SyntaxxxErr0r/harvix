A show cave is defined here as a natural, underground cavity, which has been equipped for visitors, is accessible on foot using walkways and steps and is fitted with lighting. Show caves have regular opening times, usually with regular guided tours of about 30 to 45 minutes duration. They are almost all electrically lighted. Only the Easter Cave and the Schellenberg Ice Cave still use carbide lamps. In 1884 the Olga Cave was the first German show cave to be equipped with electrical lighting and the second in the world to be thus fitted. Only the Kraus Cave in the Styria in Austria was equipped earlier, in 1883.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Schauh%C3%B6hlen_in_Deutschland.png/400px-Schauh%C3%B6hlen_in_Deutschland.png
