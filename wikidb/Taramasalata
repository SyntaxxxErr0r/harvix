8.20	Taramasalata	Taramosalata	Taramosalata is a Greek and Turkish meze. It is traditionally made from taramas, the salted and cured roe of the cod or the carp, though blends based on other forms of fish roe have become more common. The roe is mixed with either bread crumbs or mashed potato, and lemon juice, vinegar and olive oil. It is usually eaten as a dip, with bread or raw vegetables. The colour can vary from creamy beige to pink, depending on the type of roe used. Mass-produced taramosalata is often a bright pink due to the addition of food colouring. The alternative spelling 'taramasalata' is sometimes found. In Greece Taramosalata is mainly eaten at Καθαρά Δευτέρα (Clean Monday), the first day of the Easter lent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Taramosalata01.jpg/220px-Taramosalata01.jpg
