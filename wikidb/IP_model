66.4	IP_model	TCP/IP model	The TCP/IP model is a descriptive framework for computer network protocols created in the 1970s by DARPA, an agency of the United States Department of Defense. The name derives from the two most important protocols of the networking protocol suite, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). The model evolved from the operational principles of the ARPANET, which was an early wide area network and a predecessor of the Internet. The TCP/IP model is formalized in the Internet protocol suite and is sometimes called the Internet model or the DoD model.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/IP_stack_connections.svg/350px-IP_stack_connections.svg.png
