56.6	Hibernation	Hibernation	Hibernation is a state of inactivity and metabolic depression in animals, characterized by lower body temperature, slower breathing, and/or lower metabolic rate. Hibernating animals conserve energy, especially during winter when food supplies are limited, tapping energy reserves, body fat, at a slow rate. Although traditionally reserved for "deep" hibernators such as rodents, the term has been redefined based on specialized metabolic reductions and many experts believe that the processes of daily torpor and hibernation form a continuum. Hibernation during summer months is known as aestivation. Some reptile species are said to brumate, or undergo brumation, but the connection to this phenomenon with hibernation is not clear.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Eptesicus_nilssonii_hibernating.JPG/220px-Eptesicus_nilssonii_hibernating.JPG
