8.00	QuickBasic	QuickBASIC	Microsoft QuickBASIC (also QB; not to be confused with "QBasic") is an Integrated Development Environment (or IDE) and compiler for the BASIC programming language that was developed by Microsoft. QuickBASIC runs mainly on DOS, though there was a short-lived version for Mac OS. It is loosely based on GW-BASIC but adds user-defined types, improved programming structures, better graphics and disk support and a compiler in addition to the interpreter. Microsoft marketed QuickBASIC as the introductory level for their BASIC Professional Development System.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/QuickBasic_Opening_Screen.png/300px-QuickBasic_Opening_Screen.png
