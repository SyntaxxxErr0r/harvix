75.0	Operation_Cyclone	Operation Cyclone	Operation Cyclone was the code name for the United States Central Intelligence Agency program to arm, train, and finance the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, 1979 to 1989. The program leaned heavily towards supporting militant Islamic groups that were favored by neighboring Pakistan, rather than other, less ideological Afghan resistance groups that had also been fighting the Marxist-oriented Democratic Republic of Afghanistan regime since before the Soviet intervention. Operation Cyclone was one of the longest and most expensive covert CIA operations ever undertaken; funding began with $20â€“30 million per year in 1980 and rose to $630 million per year in 1987.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Mujahid-MANPAD.JPEG/250px-Mujahid-MANPAD.JPEG
