3.00	Khaki_Election	Khaki election	In British political history, a khaki election is any national election which is heavily influenced by wartime or postwar sentiment. In the British general election of 1900, the Conservative Party government of Lord Salisbury was returned to office with an increased majority over the Liberal Party. The reason for this name is that the main issue of the election was the Second Boer War, as "khaki" was the colour of the relatively new military uniform of the British army that had been universally adopted in that war.
