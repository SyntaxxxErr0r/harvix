1.00	Lydian_dominant	Acoustic scale	In music, the acoustic scale, overtone scale, Lydian dominant scale, or Lydian 7 scale, is a seven-note synthetic scale which, starting on C, contains the notes: C, D, E, F, G, A and B. This differs from the major scale in having a raised fourth and lowered seventh scale degree. It is the fourth mode of the melodic minor ascending scale. The term "acoustic scale" is sometimes used to describe a particular mode of this seven note collection (e.g. the specific ordering C-D-E-F-G-A-B) and is sometimes used to describe the collection as a whole (e.g. including orderings such as E-F-G-A-B-C-D).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Lydian_dominant_C.png/300px-Lydian_dominant_C.png
