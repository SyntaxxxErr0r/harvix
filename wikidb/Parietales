2.00	Parietales	Parietales	Parietales is a botanical name of an order of flowering plants. It is a descriptive botanical name, short for "placentae parietales". Thus it could be used even today (for a taxon above the rank of family). The termination -ales is only coincidentally identical to that appropriate to the rank of order.
