Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production. DOE also sponsors more basic and applied scientific research than any other US federal agency; most of this is funded through its system of United States Department of Energy National Laboratories.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/US-DeptOfEnergy-Seal.svg/140px-US-DeptOfEnergy-Seal.svg.png
