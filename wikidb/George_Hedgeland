1.00	George_Hedgeland	George Hedgeland	George Caleb Hedgeland (1825â€“1898) was a British designer of stained glass windows in the 19th century. He was the son of the architect John Pike Hedgeland and worked from a studio in London in the 1850s. His work, which was displayed at the Great Exhibition in 1851, was characterised by the use of bold designs. His career was short, as ill-health led to a move to Australia in 1860, where he died.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Norwich_Cathedral_west_window.jpg/220px-Norwich_Cathedral_west_window.jpg
