95.8	Extensible_Firmware_Interface	Unified Extensible Firmware Interface	The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI is a replacement for the older BIOS firmware interface, present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers, which is vulnerable to bootkit malware. It can be used in business computers to allow remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even if the operating system will not load.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Uefi_logo.svg/150px-Uefi_logo.svg.png
