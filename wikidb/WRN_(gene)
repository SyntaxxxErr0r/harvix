2.00	WRN_(gene)	Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase	WRN is a human gene that provides instructions for producing Werner protein, which is a type of enzyme called a helicase. Helicase enzymes generally unwind and separate double-stranded DNA. These activities are necessary before DNA can be copied in preparation for cell division (DNA replication). Helicase enzymes are also critical for making a blueprint of a gene for protein production, a process called transcription. Further evidence suggests that Werner protein plays a critical role in repairing DNA. Overall, this protein helps maintain the structure and integrity of a person's DNA.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Protein_WRN_PDB_2axl.png/250px-Protein_WRN_PDB_2axl.png
