52.4	Hilbert_space	Hilbert space	The mathematical concept of a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are required to be complete, a property that stipulates the existence of enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Harmonic_partials_on_strings.svg/220px-Harmonic_partials_on_strings.svg.png
