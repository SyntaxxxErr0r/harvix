80.8	Theory_of_Constraints	Theory of constraints	The theory of constraints (TOC) adopts the common idiom "A chain is no stronger than its weakest link" as a new management paradigm. This means that processes, organizations, etc., are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely affect the outcome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Factory.svg/100px-Factory.svg.png
