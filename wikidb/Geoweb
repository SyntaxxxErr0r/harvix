92.2	Geoweb	Geoweb	The Geospatial Web (Pronunciation: 'gēō-spãy-shee-ăl wěb', Grammatical Function: adjective noun) or Geoweb is a relatively new term that implies the merging of geographical (location-based) information with the abstract information that currently dominates the Internet. This would create an environment where one could search for things based on location instead of by keyword only – e.g. “What is Here?”.
