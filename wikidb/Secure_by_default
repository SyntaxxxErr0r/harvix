4.10	Secure_by_default	Secure by default	Security by default, in software, means that the default configuration settings are the most secure settings possible, which are not necessarily the most user friendly settings. In many cases, security and user friendliness is waged based on both risk analysis and usability tests. This leads to the discussion what the most secure settings actually are. As a result, the precise meaning of secure by default remains undefined.
