87.6	Ampere	Ampere	The ampere (SI unit symbol: A), often shortened to amp, is the SI unit of electric current (quantity symbol: I,i) and is one of the seven SI base units. It is named after André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836), French mathematician and physicist, considered the father of electrodynamics. Note that SI supports only the use of symbols and deprecates the use of any abbreviations for units.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Galvanometer_1890_drawing.png/200px-Galvanometer_1890_drawing.png
