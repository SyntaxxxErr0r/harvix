215.6	Obesity	Obesity	Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health, leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems. Body mass index (BMI), a measurement which compares weight and height, defines people as overweight (pre-obese) if their BMI is between 25 and 30 kg/m2, and obese when it is greater than 30 kg/m2.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Obesity-waist_circumference.svg/230px-Obesity-waist_circumference.svg.png
