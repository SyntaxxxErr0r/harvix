51.4	Contango	Contango	Contango is the market condition wherein the price of a forward or futures contract is trading above the expected spot price at contract maturity. The resulting futures or forward curve would typically be upward sloping (i.e. "normal"), since contracts for further dates would typically trade at even higher prices. (The curves in question plot market prices for various contracts at different maturitiesâ€”cf. term structure of interest rates)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Contangobackwardation.png/300px-Contangobackwardation.png
