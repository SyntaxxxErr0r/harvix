114.7	IP	Internet protocol suite	The Internet protocol suite is the set of communications protocols used for the Internet and other similar networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP, because of its most important protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), which were the first networking protocols defined in this standard. Modern IP networking represents a synthesis of several developments that began to evolve in the 1960s and 1970s, namely the precursors of the Internet and local area networks, which emerged during the 1980s, together with the advent of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/SRI_First_Internetworked_Connection_diagram.jpg/220px-SRI_First_Internetworked_Connection_diagram.jpg
