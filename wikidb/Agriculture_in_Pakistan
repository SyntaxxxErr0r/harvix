1.00	Agriculture_in_Pakistan	Agriculture in Pakistan	Pakistan's principal natural resources are arable land and water. About 25% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. Pakistan irrigates three times more acres than Russia. Agriculture accounts for about 21.2% of GDP and employs about 43% of the labor force. In Pakistan, the most agricultural province is Punjab where wheat and cotton are the most grown. Some people also have mango orchards but due to some problems like weather, they're not found in a big range.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Pakistan_Agriculture.png/300px-Pakistan_Agriculture.png
