51.6	Bitches_Brew	Bitches Brew	Bitches Brew is a studio double album by jazz musician Miles Davis, released in April 1970 on Columbia Records. The album continued his experimentation with electric instruments previously featured on his critically acclaimed In a Silent Way album. With the use of these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis rejected traditional jazz rhythms in favor of a looser, rock-influenced improvisational style.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Bitches_brew.jpg/220px-Bitches_brew.jpg
