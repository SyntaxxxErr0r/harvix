52.4	Shallot	Shallot	The shallot is a botanical variety of the species Allium cepa, to which the multiplier onion also belongs. The shallot was formerly classified as a separate species, A. ascalonicum, a name now considered a synonym of the currently accepted name. Shallots, like onions and garlic, are now classified in the plant family Amaryllidaceae, but were formerly considered to belong to the separate family Alliaceae.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Shallots_-_sliced_and_whole.jpg/220px-Shallots_-_sliced_and_whole.jpg
