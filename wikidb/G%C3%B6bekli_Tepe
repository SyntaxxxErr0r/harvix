56.5	G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe	Göbekli Tepe	Göbekli Tepe ("Potbelly Hill") is a Neolithic (stone-age) hilltop sanctuary erected at the top of a mountain ridge in southeastern Anatolia, some 15 kilometers (9 mi) northeast of the town of Şanlıurfa (formerly Urfa / Edessa). It is the oldest known human-made religious structure. The site was most likely erected by hunter-gatherers in the 10th millennium BCE (c. 12,000 years ago) and has been under excavation since 1994 by German and Turkish archaeologists. Together with Nevalı Çori, it has revolutionized understanding of the Eurasian Neolithic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Smithsonian_map_g%C3%B6bekli_tepe.jpg/285px-Smithsonian_map_g%C3%B6bekli_tepe.jpg
