8.01	Hi_Ho!_Cherry-O	Hi Ho! Cherry-O	Hi Ho! Cherry-O is a children's put and take board game currently published by Milton Bradley in which two to four players spin a spinner in an attempt to collect cherries. The original edition, designed by Hermann Wernhard and first published in 1960 by Whitman Publishers , had players compete to collect 10 cherries. During an update in 2007, the rules were updated to include a cooperative play variant, where players cooperate to remove all fruit from the board before a bird puzzle is completed.
