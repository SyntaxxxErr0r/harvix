1.00	Debt_forgiveness	Debt relief	Debt relief is the partial or total forgiveness of debt, or the slowing or stopping of debt growth, owed by individuals, corporations, or nations. From antiquity through the 19th century, it refers to domestic debts, in particular agricultural debts and freeing of debt slaves. In the late 20th century, it came to refer primarily to Third World debt, which started exploding with the Latin American debt crisis (Mexico 1982, etc.). In the early 21st century, it is of increased applicability to individuals in developed countries, due to credit bubbles and housing bubbles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/95/Sick_men%27s_ward_in_the_Marshalsea_prison.JPG/170px-Sick_men%27s_ward_in_the_Marshalsea_prison.JPG
