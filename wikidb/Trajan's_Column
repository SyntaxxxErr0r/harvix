56.8	Trajan's_Column	Trajan's Column	Trajan's Column (Italian: ) is a Roman triumphal column in Rome, Italy, which commemorates Roman emperor Trajan's victory in the Dacian Wars. It was probably constructed under the supervision of the architect Apollodorus of Damascus at the order of the Roman Senate. It is located in Trajan's Forum, built near the Quirinal Hill, north of the Roman Forum. Completed in AD 113 , the freestanding column is most famous for its spiral bas relief, that artistically describes the epic wars between the Romans and Dacians (101–102 and 105–106). Its design has inspired numerous victory columns, both ancient and modern.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Italien_Rom_Trajansaeule_sb1.JPG/250px-Italien_Rom_Trajansaeule_sb1.JPG
