The issue has been part of the political debate over abortion, dating to 1988 when U.S. President Ronald Reagan directed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to produce a report on physical and psychological effects of abortion in the expectation that such a report could be used to justify restricting access to abortion. There is no scientific evidence of a causal relationship between abortion and poor mental health. Pre-existing factors in a woman's life, such as emotional attachment to the pregnancy, lack of social support, pre-existing psychiatric illness, and conservative views on abortion increase the likelihood of experiencing negative feelings after an abortion.
