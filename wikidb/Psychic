61.9	Psychic	Psychic	A psychic (from the Greek ψυχικός psychikos—"of the mind, mental" some times spelled phycics) is a person who professes an ability to perceive information hidden from the normal senses through extrasensory perception (ESP), or who is said by others to have such abilities. The word "psychic" is also used to describe theatrical performers, such as stage magicians, who use techniques such as prestidigitation, cold reading, and hot reading to produce the appearance of such abilities. It can also denote an ability of the mind to influence the world physically using psychokinetic powers such as those professed by Uri Geller.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/PsychicBoston.jpg/222px-PsychicBoston.jpg
