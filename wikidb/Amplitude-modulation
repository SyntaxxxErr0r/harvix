1.00	Amplitude-modulation	Amplitude modulation	Amplitude modulation is a technique used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave. AM works by varying the strength of the transmitted signal in relation to the information being sent. For example, changes in signal strength may be used to specify the sounds to be reproduced by a loudspeaker, or the light intensity of television pixels. Contrast this with frequency modulation, in which the frequency is varied, and phase modulation, in which the phase is varied.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif
