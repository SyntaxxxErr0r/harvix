It is famous for its performances of revolutionary and folk songs. They have been reported to be one of the country's most popular groups, although other critics have questioned what it means for a group to be popular in a country where the only music legally available comes from the few state-sanctioned musicians.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Pochonbo_Electronic_Ensemble_cover.jpg/220px-Pochonbo_Electronic_Ensemble_cover.jpg
