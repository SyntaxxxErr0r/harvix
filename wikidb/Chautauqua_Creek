2.00	Chautauqua_Creek	Chautauqua Creek	Chautauqua Creek is a tributary of Lake Erie, approximately 15 miles (24 km) long, in the southwestern corner of New York in the United States. The headwaters of the creek rise in the town of Sherman, in Chautauqua County, and flow in a northerly direction through the town and village of Westfield where they empty into Lake Erie. For much of its length, the creek serves as the boundary line between the towns of Westfield and Chautauqua.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/Chautauqua_Creek.JPG/256px-Chautauqua_Creek.JPG
