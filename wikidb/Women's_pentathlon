The women's pentathlon was contested in the Olympics from 1964 until 1980, and it was replaced in the 1984 Games with the heptathlon. It had a different set of events than the ancient Olympic pentathlon. The events were shot put, high jump, a hurdling race, sprint and long jump. Pentathlon is sometimes contested instead of heptathlon even today because of facility limitations. Indoor arenas are incapable of hosting events such as the javelin throw. The events in indoor pentathlon are 60 metre hurdles, high jump, shot put, long jump and 800 metres. The current world record belongs to Nataliya Dobrynska, who scored 5013 points on 9 March 2012 at the World Indoor Championships held in Istanbul.
