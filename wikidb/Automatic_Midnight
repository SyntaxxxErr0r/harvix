1.00	Automatic_Midnight	Automatic Midnight	Automatic Midnight is the first album by the San Diego, California rock band Hot Snakes, released in 2000 by Swami Records. Both the band and the album began as a "side project" for John Reis in June 1999, during time off from his main band Rocket From the Crypt. Reis wrote and recorded a batch of songs in San Diego with Delta 72 drummer Jason Kourkounis. To provide vocals for the tracks Reis called in Rick Froberg, whom he had played with in Pitchfork and Drive Like Jehu from 1986 to 1995. Most of the material from these sessions was used to create Automatic Midnight, which became the first release for Reis' newly formed Swami Records label.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/Hot_Snakes_-_Automatic_Midnight_cover.jpg/220px-Hot_Snakes_-_Automatic_Midnight_cover.jpg
