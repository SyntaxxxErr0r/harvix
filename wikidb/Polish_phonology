7.63	Polish_phonology	Polish phonology	The phonological system of the Polish language is similar in many ways to those of other Slavic languages, although there are some characteristic features found in only a few other languages of the family, such as contrasting retroflex and palatal fricatives and affricates, and nasal vowels. The vowel system is relatively simple, with just six oral monophthongs and two nasals, while the consonant system is more complex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Polish_vowel_chart.svg/250px-Polish_vowel_chart.svg.png
