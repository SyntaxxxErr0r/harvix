56.8	De_Lorean_DMC-12	DeLorean DMC-12	The DeLorean DMC-12 is a sports car originally manufactured in Dunmurry, a suburb of south west Belfast, Northern Ireland by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company for the American market in 1981-82. Most commonly known as the DeLorean, it was the only model produced by the company which would go into liquidation as the US car market went through its largest slump since the 1930s. The DMC-12 features gull-wing doors with a fiberglass "underbody", to which non-structural brushed stainless steel panels are affixed. A modified version of the car became iconic for its appearance as a time machine in the Back to the Future film franchise.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Delorean_dmc12_front.jpg/250px-Delorean_dmc12_front.jpg
