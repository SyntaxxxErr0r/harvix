70.8	Aquaponics	Aquaponics	Aquaponics is a sustainable food production system that combines a traditional aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as snails, fish, crayfish or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in a symbiotic environment. In the aquaculture, effluents accumulate in the water, increasing toxicity for the fish. This water is led to a hydroponic system where the by-products from the aquaculture are filtered out by the plants as vital nutrients, after which the cleansed water is recirculated back to the animals. The term aquaponics is a portmanteau of the terms aquaculture and hydroponic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Portable_fish_farm_at_growing_power.jpg/250px-Portable_fish_farm_at_growing_power.jpg
