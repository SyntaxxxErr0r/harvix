20.86	Sperm_donation	Sperm donation	Sperm donation is the provision (or ‘donation’) by a man, (known as a ‘sperm donor’), of his sperm, with the intention that it be used to impregnate a woman who is not his sexual partner. While the sperm donor is the natural or biological father of every child produced as a result of his donations, he is generally not intended to be the legal or de jure father. Depending on the jurisdiction and its laws, he may or may not later be eligible to seek parental rights or be held responsible for parental obligations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Success_rates_by_amount_of_sperm.svg/250px-Success_rates_by_amount_of_sperm.svg.png
