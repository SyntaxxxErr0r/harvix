6.30	Grimsby_Dock_Tower	Grimsby Dock Tower	Grimsby Dock Tower is a hydraulic accumulator tower and a famous maritime landmark in Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, England. It was completed on 27 March 1852 with the purpose of containing a 30,000 UK gallon (136 mÂ³) hydraulic wrought iron reservoir at a height of 200 feet (61 m), to provide hydraulic power (rather than a supply of water) to the lock gates and cranes of Grimsby Docks. The extreme height of the tower was necessary to achieve sufficient pressure. Water towers for water supply purposes don't need anything approaching this height.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Grimsby_Dock_Tower.jpg/220px-Grimsby_Dock_Tower.jpg
