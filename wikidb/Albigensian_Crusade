71.6	Albigensian_Crusade	Albigensian Crusade	The Albigensian Crusade or Cathar Crusade (1209â€“1229) was a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Catholic Church to eliminate Catharism in Languedoc. The Crusade was prosecuted primarily by the French crown and promptly took on a political flavour, resulting in not only a significant reduction in the number of practicing Cathars but also a realignment of Occitania, bringing it into the sphere of the French crown and diminishing the distinct regional culture and high level of Aragonese influence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Cartes_Occitanie.png/300px-Cartes_Occitanie.png
