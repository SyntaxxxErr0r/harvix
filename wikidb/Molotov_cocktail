74.0	Molotov_cocktail	Molotov cocktail	The Molotov cocktail, also known as the petrol bomb, gasoline bomb, Molotov bomb, fire bottle, fire bomb, or simply Molotov, is a generic name used for a variety of improvised incendiary weapons. Due to the relative ease of production, they are frequently used by non-professionally equipped fighters and others who cannot afford, manufacture, or obtain hand grenades. They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than instantly destroy them. The name "Molotov cocktail" was coined by the Finns during the Winter War. The name is an insulting reference (not a tribute) to Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov, who was responsible for the partition of Finland.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Talvisota_Molotov_Cocktail.PNG/220px-Talvisota_Molotov_Cocktail.PNG
