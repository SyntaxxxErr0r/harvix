3.00	Badge_engineered	Badge engineering	Badge engineering is a term that describes the rebadging (that is, the replacement of the branding trademark) of one product (especially automobiles) as another. Due to the high cost of designing and engineering a totally new model, or establishing a new brand (which may take many years to gain acceptance), it is often more cost-effective to rebadge a single product multiple times.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/2004-2005_Holden_VZ_Monaro_CV8_coupe_01.jpg/120px-2004-2005_Holden_VZ_Monaro_CV8_coupe_01.jpg
