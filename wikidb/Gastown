44.54	Gastown	Gastown	Gastown is a national historic site in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the northeast end of Downtown adjacent to the Downtown Eastside. Its historical boundaries were the waterfront (now Water Street and the CPR tracks), Columbia Street, Hastings Street, and Cambie Street, which were the borders of the 1870 townsite survey, the proper name and postal address of which was Granville, B.I. ("Burrard Inlet"). Today's official boundary does not include most of Hastings Street except for the Woodward's and Dominion Buildings, and stretches east past Columbia St., to the laneway running parallel to the west side of Main Street.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Vancouver_Gastown_Gassy_Jack.jpg/220px-Vancouver_Gastown_Gassy_Jack.jpg
