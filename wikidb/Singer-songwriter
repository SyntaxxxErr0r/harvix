238.2	Singer-songwriter	Singer-songwriter	Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose and sing their own musical material including lyrics and melodies. As opposed to contemporary popular music singers who write their own songs, the term singer-songwriter describes a distinct form of artistry, closely associated with the folk-acoustic tradition. Singer-songwriters often provide the sole accompaniment to an entire composition or song, typically using a guitar or piano; both the compositions and the arrangements are written primarily as solo vehicles, with the material angled toward topical issuesâ€”sometimes political, sometimes introspective, sensitive, romantic, and confessional.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Joan_Baez_Bob_Dylan_crop.jpg/220px-Joan_Baez_Bob_Dylan_crop.jpg
