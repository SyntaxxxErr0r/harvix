13.03	History_of_Lindy_Hop	History of Lindy Hop	The History of Lindy Hop begins in the African American communities of Harlem, New York during the late 1920s in conjunction with swing jazz. Lindy Hop is closely related to earlier African American vernacular dances but quickly gained its own fame through dancers in films, performances, competitions, and professional dance troupes. It became especially popular in the 1930s with the invention of aerials. The popularity of Lindy Hop declined after World War II, and the dance remained dormant until revived by European and American dancers in the 1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e1/JitterbugFSA_1.jpg/220px-JitterbugFSA_1.jpg
