A large molasses storage tank burst, and a wave of molasses rushed through the streets at an estimated 35 mph (56 km/h), killing 21 and injuring 150. The event has entered local folklore, and residents claim that on hot summer days, the area still smells of molasses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/BostonMolassesDisaster.jpg/400px-BostonMolassesDisaster.jpg
