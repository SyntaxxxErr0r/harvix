176.7	Infection	Infection	An infection is the invasion of body tissues by disease-causing microorganisms, their multiplication and the reaction of body tissues to these microorganisms and the toxins that they produce. Infections are caused by microorganisms such as viruses, prions, bacteria, and viroids, though larger organisms like macroparasites and fungi can also infect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Herrerasaurus1.JPG/150px-Herrerasaurus1.JPG
