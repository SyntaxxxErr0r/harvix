3.20	1993%E2%80%9394_UEFA_Champions_League	1993–94 UEFA Champions League	The 1993–94 UEFA Champions League was the 39th edition of UEFA's top club football tournament, and the second since the tournament was rebranded as the UEFA Champions League. The competition was won by A.C. Milan, their fifth title, beating Barcelona 4–0 in the final. Marseille were the defending champions, but were not allowed to enter the competition after a match-fixing scandal revealed after the final that Marseille came out victorious in the preceding season. This saw them relegated to Division 2 and stripped of their league title.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/World_Map_FIFA.svg/300px-World_Map_FIFA.svg.png
