54.5	Flush_toilet	Flush toilet	A flush toilet is a toilet that disposes of human waste by using water to flush it through a drainpipe to another location. Flushing mechanisms are found more often on western toilets (used in the sitting position), but many squat toilets also are made for automated flushing. Modern toilets incorporate an 'S','U', 'J', or 'P' shaped bend that causes the water in the toilet bowl to collect and act as a seal against sewer gases. Since flush toilets are typically not designed to handle waste on site, their drain pipes must be connected to waste conveyance and waste treatment systems. A flush toilet may be euphemistically called a lavatory, a loo, a john, a water closet, abbreviated to "W.C.", or simply "toilet."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Toilet_370x580.jpg/220px-Toilet_370x580.jpg
