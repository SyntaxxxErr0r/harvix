108.7	Alcoholic_beverage	Alcoholic beverage	An alcoholic beverage is a drink containing ethanol, commonly known as alcohol. Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes: beers, wines, and spirits. They are legally consumed in most countries, and over 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. In particular, such laws specify the minimum age at which a person may legally buy or drink them. This minimum age varies between 16 and 25 years, depending upon the country and the type of drink. Most nations set it at 18 years of age.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Bar_Hard_Rock_Cafe_Prague.png/300px-Bar_Hard_Rock_Cafe_Prague.png
