51.46	Audioslave	Audioslave	Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles, California, in 2001 and disbanded in 2007. The four-piece band consisted of then-former Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist, Chris Cornell, and then-former Rage Against the Machine members, Tom Morello , Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics initially described Audioslave as an amalgamation of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Audioslave_2005.jpg/250px-Audioslave_2005.jpg
