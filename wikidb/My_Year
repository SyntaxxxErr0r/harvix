1.10	My_Year	My Year	My Year is a book by Roald Dahl and was published in 1993. It contains some of Roald Dahl's most remarkable writing and is based on a diary he wrote during the final year of his life. In a month-by-month journey, he reflects on the past and present from many perspectives. Reminiscences of his childhood and adolescence are combined with tips on how to rid your lawn of moles or produce a first-class conker. All of this is woven into Roald Dahl's observations of the changing seasons. It features watercolours by Quentin Blake.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/MyYear.jpg/200px-MyYear.jpg
