74.5	Joe_job	Joe job	A joe job is a spamming technique that sends out unsolicited e-mails using spoofed sender data. Early joe jobs aimed at tarnishing the reputation of the apparent sender or inducing the recipients to take action against him (see also e-mail spoofing), but they are now typically used by commercial spammers to conceal the true origin of their messages.
