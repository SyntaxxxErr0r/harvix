81.2	Holy_See	Holy See	The Holy See (Latin: "holy chair") is the episcopal jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome. The primacy of Rome makes its bishop the worldwide leader of the Catholic Church, commonly known as the Pope. It is the preeminent episcopal see of the Catholic Church, forming the central government of the Church. As such, diplomatically, the Holy See acts and speaks for the whole Catholic Church. It is also recognized by other subjects of international law as a sovereign entity, headed by the Pope, with which diplomatic relations can be maintained."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Holy_See.svg/220px-Coat_of_arms_of_the_Holy_See.svg.png
