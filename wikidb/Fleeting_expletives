4.00	Fleeting_expletives	Fleeting expletive	On March 17, 2008, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear, in September 2008, a case on whether the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is allowed to regulate the use of fleeting expletives on television broadcasts. The parties in the case are the Fox Broadcasting Company (supported by other television networks including ABC, CBS, and NBC) and the FCC. A federal appeals court had ruled in the favor of the networks; the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the FCC's appeal.
