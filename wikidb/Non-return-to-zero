13.63	Non-return-to-zero	Non-return-to-zero	In telecommunication, a non-return-to-zero line code is a binary code in which 1's are represented by one significant condition (usually a positive voltage) and 0s are represented by some other significant condition (usually a negative voltage), with no other neutral or rest condition. The pulses have more energy than a RZ code. Unlike RZ, NRZ does not have a rest state. NRZ is not inherently a self-synchronizing code, thus some additional synchronization technique (for example a run length limited constraint, or a parallel synchronization signal) must be used for avoiding bit slip.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/NRZcode.png
