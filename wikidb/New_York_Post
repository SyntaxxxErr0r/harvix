77.4	New_York_Post	New York Post	The New York Post is the 13th-oldest newspaper published in the United States and is generally acknowledged as the oldest to have been published continuously as a daily, although – as is the case with most other papers – its publication has been periodically interrupted by labor actions. Since 1993, it has been owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which had owned it previously from 1976 to 1988. It is the seventh-largest newspaper in the U.S. by circulation. Its editorial offices are located at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, in New York City, New York. The Post is known for its right-wing orientation and sensationalist headlines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8e/New_York_Post_font_page_111307.jpg/225px-New_York_Post_font_page_111307.jpg
