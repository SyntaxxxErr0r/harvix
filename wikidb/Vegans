10.03	Vegans	Veganism	Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products. Ethical vegans reject the commodity status of animals and the use of animal products for any purpose, while dietary vegans or strict vegetarians eliminate them from their diet only. Another form, environmental veganism, rejects the use of animal products on the premise that the industrial practice is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Tofu_scr.jpg/133px-Tofu_scr.jpg
