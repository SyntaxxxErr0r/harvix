There are many approaches to motivation: physiological, behavioural, cognitive, and social.It's the crucial element in setting and attaining goalsâ€”and research shows you can influence your own levels of motivation and self-control . According to various theories, motivation may be rooted in a basic need to minimize physical pain and maximize pleasure, or it may include specific needs such as eating and resting, or a desired object, goal, state of being, ideal, or it may be attributed to less-apparent reasons such as altruism, selfishness, morality, or avoiding mortality.
