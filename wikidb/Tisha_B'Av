60.7	Tisha_B'Av	Tisha B'Av	Â·) of the month of Av in the Hebrew calendar. The fast commemorates the destruction of both the First Temple and Second Temple in Jerusalem, which occurred about 655 years apart, but on the same Hebrew calendar date. Although primarily meant to commemorate the destruction of the Temples, it is also considered appropriate to commemorate other Jewish tragedies that occurred on this day, most notably the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. Accordingly, the day has been called the "saddest day in Jewish history".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Francesco_Hayez_017.jpg/225px-Francesco_Hayez_017.jpg
