77.1	Knee	Knee	The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia, and one between the femur and patella. It is the largest joint in the human body and is very complicated. The knee is a mobile trocho-ginglymus (a pivotal hinge joint), which permits flexion and extension as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation. Since in humans the knee supports nearly the whole weight of the body, it is vulnerable to both acute injury and the development of osteoarthritis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Knee.agr.jpg/250px-Knee.agr.jpg
