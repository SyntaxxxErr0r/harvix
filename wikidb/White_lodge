Formerly a royal residence, today, it houses the Royal Ballet Lower School, instructing students aged 11â€“16. As part of a major redevelopment project led by the ballet school, the building now also houses the newly appointed White Lodge Museum and Ballet Resource Centre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/White_Lodge.jpg/300px-White_Lodge.jpg
