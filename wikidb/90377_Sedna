51.6	90377_Sedna	90377 Sedna	90377 Sedna is a very large trans-Neptunian object, which as of 2012 was about three times as far from the Sun as Neptune. Spectroscopy has revealed that Sedna's surface composition is similar to that of some other trans-Neptunian objects, being largely a mixture of water, methane and nitrogen ices with tholins. Its surface is one of the reddest in the Solar System. Neither its mass nor its size are well known and the IAU has not formally designated it as a dwarf planet, although it is considered to be one by several astronomers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Nasasedna.jpg/250px-Nasasedna.jpg
