286.4	Milgram_experiment	Milgram experiment	The Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of notable social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram, which measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts that conflicted with their personal conscience. Milgram first described his research in 1963 in an article published in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Milgram_Experiment_v2.png/200px-Milgram_Experiment_v2.png
