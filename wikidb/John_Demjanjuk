54.9	John_Demjanjuk	John Demjanjuk	John Demjanjuk (born Ivan Mykolaiovych Demianiuk; Ukrainian: ; 3 April 1920 â€“ 17 March 2012) was a Ukrainian-American convicted for war crimes as an accessory to the murder of 27,900 Jews while acting as a guard at the Sobibor Nazi German extermination camp. Since his conviction was pending appeal at the time of his death, Demjanjuk remains "presumed innocent" under German law, and his earlier conviction is invalidated. According to the Munich state court, Demjanjuk does not have a criminal record.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/John_Demjanjuk_3.jpg/235px-John_Demjanjuk_3.jpg
