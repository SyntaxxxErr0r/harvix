60.1	Pointy_Haired_Boss	Pointy-haired Boss	The pointy-haired boss (often abbreviated to just PHB or "The Boss") is Dilbert's boss in the Dilbert comic strip. He is notable for his micromanagement, gross incompetence and unawareness of his surroundings, yet somehow retains power in the workplace. In the Dilbert TV series, in which he is voiced by comedian Larry Miller, the character is notably smarter (although still quite stupid and inept) and more openly corrupt. He is also parodied in Bee Movie as Dean Buzzwell, also voiced by Larry Miller.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Pointy-Haired_Boss.jpg/130px-Pointy-Haired_Boss.jpg
