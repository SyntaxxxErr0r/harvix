1.00	Internally_displaced_Palestinians	Present absentee	A present absentee is a Palestinian who fled or was expelled from his home in Palestine by Jewish or Israeli forces, before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, but who remained within the area that became the state of Israel. Present absentees are also referred to as internally displaced Palestinians (IDPs). The term applies to the present absentee's descendants too. In 1950 these were 46,000 of the 156,000 Palestinians in Israel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Flag_of_Palestine.svg/160px-Flag_of_Palestine.svg.png
