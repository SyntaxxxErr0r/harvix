1.10	131st_Bomb_Wing	131st Bomb Wing	The United States Air Force's 131st Bomb Wing is a B-2 unit of the Missouri Air National Guard. It is located at Whiteman AFB, in association with the 509th Bomb Wing of the active duty United States Air Force, and a small Guard base located at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. With its roots going back to the early 1920s, it has become one of the most historical and important wings in the United States Air Force. The F-15C Eagles formally operated by the wing were distributed to the 120th Fighter Wing and Hickam AFB In Hawaii.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/131st_Fighter_Wing.png/200px-131st_Fighter_Wing.png
