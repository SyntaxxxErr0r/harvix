64.5	Harry_Nilsson	Harry Nilsson	Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 â€“ January 15, 1994) was an American singer-songwriter who achieved the peak of his commercial success in the early 1970s. On all but his earliest recordings he is credited as Nilsson. He is known for the hit singles "Without You", "Everybody's Talkin'" and "Coconut". Nilsson's career is also notable for the fact that he was one of the few major pop-rock recording artists of his era to achieve significant commercial success without ever performing major public concerts or undertaking regular tours.
