108.6	Tetrahydrocannabinol	Tetrahydrocannabinol	Tetrahydrocannabinol ( -drə-kə--i-nol; THC), also known as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), is the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant. First isolated in 1964, in its pure form, it is a glassy solid when cold, and becomes viscous and sticky if warmed. An aromatic terpenoid, THC has a very low solubility in water, but good solubility in most organic solvents, specifically lipids and alcohols.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Tetrahydrocannabinol.svg/200px-Tetrahydrocannabinol.svg.png
