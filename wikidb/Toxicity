59.1	Toxicity	Toxicity	Toxicity is the degree to which a substance can damage a living or non-living organism. Toxicity can refer to the effect on a whole organism, such as an animal, bacterium, or plant, as well as the effect on a substructure of the organism, such as a cell or an organ (organotoxicity), such as the liver (hepatotoxicity). By extension, the word may be metaphorically used to describe toxic effects on larger and more complex groups, such as the family unit or society at large.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Skull_and_crossbones.svg/200px-Skull_and_crossbones.svg.png
