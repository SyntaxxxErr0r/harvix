114.2	Divine_Comedy	Divine Comedy	The Divine Comedy is an epic poem written by Dante Alighieri between 1308 and his death in 1321. It is widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative and allegorical vision of the afterlife is a culmination of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church. It helped establish the Tuscan dialect, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Michelino_DanteAndHisPoem.jpg/300px-Michelino_DanteAndHisPoem.jpg
