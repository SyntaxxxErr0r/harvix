54.3	Flash_flood	Flash flood	A flash flood is a rapid flooding of geomorphic low-lying areasâ€”washes, rivers, dry lakes and basins. It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a storm, hurricane, or tropical storm or meltwater from ice or snow flowing over ice sheets or snowfields. Flash floods may occur after the collapse of a natural ice or debris dam, or a human structure such as a man-made dam, as occurred before the Johnstown Flood of 1889. Flash floods are distinguished from a regular flood by a timescale less than six hours. The temporary availability of water is often utilized by foliage with rapid germination and short growth cycle, and by specially adapted animal life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Driving_through_flash_flood.jpg/220px-Driving_through_flash_flood.jpg
