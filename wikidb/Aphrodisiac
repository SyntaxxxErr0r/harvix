74.5	Aphrodisiac	Aphrodisiac	An aphrodisiac is a substance that increases sexual desire. The name comes from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of sexuality and love. Throughout history, many foods, drinks, and behaviors have had a reputation for making sex more attainable and/or pleasurable. However, from a historical and scientific standpoint, the alleged results may have been mainly due to mere belief by their users that they would be effective (i.e., the placebo effect). In particular, Western medical science has no substantiated claims that any particular food increases sexual desire or performance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Mucuna-pruriens-fruit.jpg/220px-Mucuna-pruriens-fruit.jpg
