10.32	Karma_in_Jainism	Karma in Jainism	In Jainism, karma is the basic principle within an overarching psycho-cosmology. In the Jain cosmology, human moral actions form the basis of the transmigration of the soul . The soul is constrained to a cycle of rebirth, trapped within the temporal world (), until it finally achieves liberation (). Liberation is achieved by following a path of purification.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Mahavra_1900_art.jpg/250px-Mahavra_1900_art.jpg
