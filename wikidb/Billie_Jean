55.4	Billie_Jean	Billie Jean	"Billie Jean" is a dance-pop R&amp;B song by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It is the second single from the singer's sixth solo album, Thriller (1982). It was written by Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. Originally disliked by Jones, the track was almost removed from the album after he and Jackson had disagreements regarding it. There are contradictory claims to what the song's lyrics refer to. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a mentally ill female fan claimed that Jackson had fathered one of her twins. Jackson himself, however, stated that "Billie Jean" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bass line and Jackson's vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Billie_Jean.jpg/220px-Billie_Jean.jpg
