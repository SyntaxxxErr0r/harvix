1.00	Sackers	Looting	Looting (Hindi lūṭ, akin to Sanskrit luṭhati, steals; also Latin latro, latronis "thief")—also referred to as sacking, plundering, despoiling, despoliation, and pillaging—is the indiscriminate taking of goods by force as part of a military or political victory, or during a catastrophe, such as during war, natural disaster, or rioting. The term is also used in a broader sense, to describe egregious instances of theft and embezzlement, such as the "plundering" of private or public assets by corrupt or greedy authorities. Looting is loosely distinguished from scavenging by the objects taken; scavenging implies taking of essential items such as food, water, shelter, or other material needed for survival while looting implies items of luxury or not necessary for survival such as art work, precious metals or other valuables. The proceeds of all these activities can be described as loot, plunder, or pillage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Spaanse_Furie_-_De_plundering_van_Mechelen_door_de_hertog_van_Alba_in_1572_%28Frans_Hogenberg%29.jpg/220px-Spaanse_Furie_-_De_plundering_van_Mechelen_door_de_hertog_van_Alba_in_1572_%28Frans_Hogenberg%29.jpg
