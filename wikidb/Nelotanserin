1.00	Nelotanserin	Nelotanserin	Nelotanserin is a drug developed by Arena Pharmaceuticals which acts as an inverse agonist on the serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT2A. APD-125 was shown to be effective and well tolerated in clinical trials, but development was halted in December 2008 because the substance did not meet the trial's endpoints. Research continues on newer analogues which may potentially be more successful.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Nelotanserin_structure.png/220px-Nelotanserin_structure.png
