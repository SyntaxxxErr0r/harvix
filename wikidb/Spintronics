51.4	Spintronics	Spintronics	There are many mechanisms of decay for a spin polarized population, but they can be broadly classified as spin-flip scattering and spin dephasing. Spin-flip scattering is a process inside a solid that does not conserve spin, and can therefore send an incoming spin up state into an outgoing spin down state. Spin dephasing is when a population of electrons with a common spin state, precess at different rates, losing the common spin state over time. In confined structures, spin dephasing can be suppressed, leading to spin lifetimes of milliseconds in semiconductor quantum dots at low temperatures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Spin_Injection.jpg/220px-Spin_Injection.jpg
