3.70	Fredrik_Idestam	Fredrik Idestam	Knut Fredrik Idestam (October 28, 1838, Tyrväntö, Finland, Russia – April 8, 1916, Helsinki, Finland, Russia) was a Finnish mining engineer and businessman, best known as a founder of Nokia. Fredrik Idestam's training was in Mining, in which he held a Master's degree; and, following in his father's footsteps, he planned a career as a civil servant in the Board of Mines of the Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1863 - 64, on a Finnish Senate (government) scholarship, Idestam undertook further studies in basic metals in Germany at the School of Mines (Bergakademie) in Freiberg, Saxony. While there, he was appointed as a mining engineer at the Finnish Board of Mines. But as early as the summer of 1864 his career plans changed. On his way through the Harz Mountains on his return trip from Freiberg, he visited a groundwood mill. This was a new invention: a factory which produced raw material for paper from wood. The process and equipment had been developed by the paper manufacturer Heinrich Voelter. The plant that Idestam saw had already reached the stage where it was capable of commercial production.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Fredrik_Idestam.png/175px-Fredrik_Idestam.png
