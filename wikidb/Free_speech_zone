55.6	Free_speech_zone	Free speech zone	Free speech zones (also known as First Amendment Zones, Free speech cages, and Protest zones) are areas set aside in public places for political activists to exercise their right of free speech in the United States. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that "Congress shall make no law... abridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." The existence of free speech zones is based on U.S. court decisions stipulating that the government may regulate the time, place, and manner—but not content—of expression. A Free Speech Zone is more restrictive than an Exclusion zone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/First_amendment_zone2.jpg/220px-First_amendment_zone2.jpg
