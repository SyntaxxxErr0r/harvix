1.10	Hyperparathyroidism,_secondary	Secondary hyperparathyroidism	Secondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) and associated hypertrophy of the glands. This disorder is especially seen in patients with chronic renal failure. It is often—although not consistently—abbreviated as SHPT in medical literature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Illu_thyroid_parathyroid.jpg/230px-Illu_thyroid_parathyroid.jpg
