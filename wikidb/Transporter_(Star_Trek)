54.2	Transporter_(Star_Trek)	Transporter (Star Trek)	A transporter is a fictional teleportation machine used in the Star Trek universe. Transporters convert a person or object into an energy pattern (a process called dematerialization), then "beam" it to a target, where it is reconverted into matter . The term transporter accident is a catch-all term for when a person or object does not rematerialize correctly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Transporter2.jpg/250px-Transporter2.jpg
