59.4	Endemism	Endemism	Endemism is the ecological state of being unique to a defined geographic location, such as an island, nation or other defined zone, or habitat type; organisms that are indigenous to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere. For example, all species of lemur are endemic to the island of Madagascar; none are native elsewhere. The extreme opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Orange-breasted_Sunbird_%28Nectarinia_violacea%29.jpg/220px-Orange-breasted_Sunbird_%28Nectarinia_violacea%29.jpg
