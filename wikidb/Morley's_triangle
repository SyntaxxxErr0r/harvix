1.00	Morley's_triangle	Morley's trisector theorem	In plane geometry, Morley's trisector theorem states that in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle, called the first Morley triangle or simply the Morley triangle. The theorem was discovered in 1899 by Anglo-American mathematician Frank Morley. It has various generalizations; in particular, if all of the trisectors are intersected, one obtains four other equilateral triangles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Morley_triangle.svg/300px-Morley_triangle.svg.png
