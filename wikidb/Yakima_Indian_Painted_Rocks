The Indian rock paintings, also known as pictographs are on a cliff of basaltic rocks parallel to the current Powerhouse road which was once an Indian trail and later a main pioneer road that connected the Ahtanum valley to the Wenas mountains.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/PR02_sm72dpi.jpg
