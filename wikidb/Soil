214.1	Soil	Soil	Soil is a natural body consisting of layers of primarily mineral constituents of variable thicknesses, which differ from the parent materials in their texture, structure, consistence, color, chemical, biological and other physical characteristics. In engineering, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material. Strictly speaking, soil is the depth of regolith that influences and has been influenced by plant roots.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Estructura-suelo.jpg/220px-Estructura-suelo.jpg
