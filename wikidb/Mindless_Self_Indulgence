Their music has a mixed style including rap, punk rock, alternative rock, electronica, techno and industrial. Due to the style of their music lacking a definite genre, they coined the term 'Industrial Jungle Pussy Punk' to describe their music, but later, they denounced the term. Their group name is derived from a solo album that frontman Jimmy Urine and his brother self-recorded in 1995.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/JimmyMSI.jpg/220px-JimmyMSI.jpg
