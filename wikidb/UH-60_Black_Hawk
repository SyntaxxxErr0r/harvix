51.9	UH-60_Black_Hawk	Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk	The UH-60 Black Hawk is a four-bladed, twin-engine, medium-lift utility helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft. Sikorsky submitted the S-70 design for the United States Army's Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the YUH-60A and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the Boeing Vertol YUH-61.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Blackhawk.jpg/300px-Blackhawk.jpg
