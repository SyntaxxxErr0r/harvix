1.00	South_Australia_(wine)	South Australian wine	The South Australian wine industry is responsible for more than half the production of all Australian wine. The state of South Australia has a vast diversity in geography and climate which allows the state to be able to successfully produce a wide range of grape varieties-from the cool climate Riesling variety in the Clare Valley to the big, full bodied Shiraz wines of the Barossa Valley.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/South_Australia_locator-MJC.png/220px-South_Australia_locator-MJC.png
