51.5	Hirsutism	Hirsutism	Hirsutism or frazonism is the excessive hairiness on women in those parts of the body where terminal hair does not normally occur or is minimal - for example, a beard or chest hair. It refers to a male pattern of body hair and it is therefore primarily of cosmetic and psychological concern. Hirsutism is a symptom rather than a disease and may be a sign of a more serious medical condition, especially if it develops well after puberty. The amount and location of the hair is measured by a Ferriman-Gallwey score.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Nuremberg_chronicles_-_Strange_People_-_Hairy_Lady_%28XIIv%29.jpg/230px-Nuremberg_chronicles_-_Strange_People_-_Hairy_Lady_%28XIIv%29.jpg
