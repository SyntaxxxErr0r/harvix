53.7	Electrode	Electrode	An electrode is an electrical conductor used to make contact with a nonmetallic part of a circuit (e.g. a semiconductor, an electrolyte or a vacuum). The word was coined by the scientist Michael Faraday from the Greek words elektron (meaning amber, from which the word electricity is derived) and hodos, a way.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Arc_welding_electrodes_and_electrode_holder.triddle.jpg/300px-Arc_welding_electrodes_and_electrode_holder.triddle.jpg
