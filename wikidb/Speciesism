54.9	Speciesism	Speciesism	Speciesism is the assigning of different values or rights to beings on the basis of their species membership. The term was created by British psychologist Richard D. Ryder in 1973 to denote a prejudice against non-humans based on physical differences that are given moral value "I use the word 'speciesism'," he wrote in 1975, "to describe the widespread discrimination that is practised by man against other species ... Speciesism is discrimination, and like all discrimination it overlooks or underestimates the similarities between the discriminator and those discriminated against."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Trial_of_Bill_Burns.jpg/270px-Trial_of_Bill_Burns.jpg
