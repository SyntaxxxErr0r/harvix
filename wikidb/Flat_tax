67.8	Flat_tax	Flat tax	A flat tax (short for flat tax rate) is a tax system with a constant marginal tax rate. Typically the term flat tax is applied in the context of an individual or corporate income that will be taxed at one marginal rate. Flat taxes in application often allow certain deductions and thus are a special case of a proportional tax.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Flat_tax_in_Europe.svg/220px-Flat_tax_in_Europe.svg.png
