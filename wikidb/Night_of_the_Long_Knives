74.6	Night_of_the_Long_Knives	Night of the Long Knives	The Night of the Long Knives (German: ·)), sometimes called Operation Hummingbird or, in Germany, the Röhm-Putsch, was a purge that took place in Nazi Germany between June 30 and July 2, 1934, when the Nazi regime carried out a series of political murders. Leading figures of the left-wing Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party, along with its namesake, Gregor Strasser, were murdered, as were prominent conservative anti-Nazis (such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had suppressed Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch in 1923). Many of those killed were members of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the paramilitary brownshirts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Boycot_of_Jewish_shops_april_1_1933.jpeg/250px-Boycot_of_Jewish_shops_april_1_1933.jpeg
