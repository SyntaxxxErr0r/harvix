62.9	Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships	Age disparity in sexual relationships	Age disparity in sexual relationships refers to sexual relations between people with a significant difference in age. Whether these relationships are accepted and the question of what counts as a significant difference in age has varied over time; and varies over cultures, different legal systems, and different ethical systems. It often depends on differing attitudes towards perceived social and economic differences between age groups and how consent is viewed, and sometimes whether or not the relationship is part of a spiritual or legal marriage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Pukirev_ner_brak.jpg/220px-Pukirev_ner_brak.jpg
