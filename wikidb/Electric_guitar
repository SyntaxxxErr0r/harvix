74.1	Electric_guitar	Electric guitar	An electric guitar is a guitar that uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction or piezoelectricity to convert vibrations of its metal strings into electric audio signals. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is amplified before sending it to a loudspeaker. Since the output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, the signal may easily be altered using electronic circuits to add "color" to the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Godin_LG-Squier_Strat.jpg/166px-Godin_LG-Squier_Strat.jpg
