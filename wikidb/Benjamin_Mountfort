4.00	Benjamin_Mountfort	Benjamin Mountfort	Benjamin Woolfield Mountfort (13 March 1825 â€“ 15 March 1898) was an English emigrant to New Zealand, where he became one of that country's most prominent 19th century architects. He was instrumental in shaping the city of Christchurch's unique architectural identity and culture, and was appointed the first official Provincial Architect of the developing province of Canterbury. Heavily influenced by the Anglo-Catholic philosophy behind early Victorian architecture, he is credited with importing the Gothic revival style to New Zealand. His Gothic designs constructed in both wood and stone in the province are considered unique to New Zealand. Today he is considered the founding architect of the province of Canterbury.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Benjamin_Mountfort.png/200px-Benjamin_Mountfort.png
