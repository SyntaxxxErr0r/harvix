4.01	Double_EP	Double extended play	A double extended play is the name typically given to vinyl records or CDs released as a set of two discs, each of which would normally qualify as an EP. The name is thus analogous to double album. As vinyl records, they may consist of a pair of 7" discs recorded at 33rpm, or two 12" discs recorded at 45rpm.
