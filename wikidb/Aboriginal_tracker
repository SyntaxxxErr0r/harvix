The trackers' hunter-gatherer lifestyle gave rise to excellent tracking skills which were advantageous to settlers in assisting them in finding food and water and locating missing persons or capturing bushrangers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Aboriginal_tracker_piper.jpg/220px-Aboriginal_tracker_piper.jpg
