165.3	Michelangelo	Michelangelo	Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 â€“ 18 February 1564), commonly known as Michelangelo , was an Italian Renaissance sculptor, painter, architect, poet, and engineer who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with fellow Italian Leonardo da Vinci.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Michelangelo-Buonarroti1.jpg/220px-Michelangelo-Buonarroti1.jpg
