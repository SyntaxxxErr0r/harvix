3.00	Ballantrae,_Ontario	Ballantrae, Ontario	Ballantrae, Ontario and Highway 48. The hamlet was first settled in the early 19th century, and by 1895 it had a population of 300. The town was located on the edge of the vast lumber industry centred in the hamlet of Vivian; a spur-line of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway built in 1877 ran through Ballantrae from Stouffville to Jackson's Point on Lake Simcoe. In the early 20th century, Ballantrae's population declined dramatically due to large-scale deforestation and the erosion of the thin soil of northern Whitchurch Township into virtual sand deserts. &lt;/ref&gt; With the passage of the Reforestation Act (1911), the process of reclaiming these areas slowly began. The Vivian Forest, a large conservation area on the edge of Ballantrae, was established in 1924 for this purpose.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Ballantrae_Ontario.jpg/250px-Ballantrae_Ontario.jpg
