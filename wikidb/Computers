93.8	Computers	Computer	A computer is a programmable machine designed to automatically carry out a sequence of arithmetic or logical operations. The particular sequence of operations can be changed readily, allowing the computer to solve more than one kind of problem. An important class of computer operations on some computing platforms is the accepting of input from human operators and the output of results formatted for human consumption. The interface between the computer and the human operator is known as the user interface.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Jacquard.loom.full.view.jpg/170px-Jacquard.loom.full.view.jpg
