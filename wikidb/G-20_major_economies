Their heads of government or heads of state have also periodically conferred at summits since their initial meeting in 2008. Collectively, the G-20 economies account for more than 80 percent of the global gross national product (GNP), 80 percent of world trade (including EU intra-trade) and two-thirds of the world population. They contribute to 84.1 percent and 82.2 percent of the world's economic growth by nominal GDP and GDP (PPP) respectively from the years 2010 to 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/G20.svg/280px-G20.svg.png
