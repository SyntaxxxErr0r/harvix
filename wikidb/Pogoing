2.00	Pogoing	Pogo (dance)	The pogo is a dance in which the dancers jump up and down, while remaining in the same location; the dance takes its name from its resemblance to the use of a pogo stick, especially in a common version of the dance, where an individual keeps their torso stiff, their arms rigid, and their legs close together. Similar to the religious dances of the Pentecostal faith and various African tribes, pogo dancing is most associated with punk rock, and is a precursor to moshing.
