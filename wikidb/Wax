96.1	Wax	Wax	Wax refers to a class of chemical compounds that are plastic near ambient temperatures. Characteristically, they melt above 45 °C (113 °F) to give a low viscosity liquid. Waxes are insoluble in water but soluble in organic, nonpolar solvents. All waxes are organic compounds, both synthetic and naturally occurring.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Cetyl_palmitate.png/220px-Cetyl_palmitate.png
