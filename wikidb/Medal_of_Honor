91.1	Medal_of_Honor	Medal of Honor	The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government. It is bestowed by the President, in the name of Congress, upon members of the United States Armed Forces who distinguish themselves through "conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States." Due to the nature of its criteria, it is often awarded posthumously (more than half have been since 1941).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Medalsofhonor2.jpg/300px-Medalsofhonor2.jpg
