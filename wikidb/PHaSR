2.00	PHaSR	Personnel halting and stimulation response rifle	The personnel halting and stimulation response rifle is a prototype non-lethal laser dazzler developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. Its purpose is to temporarily disorient and blind a target. Blinding laser weapons have been tested in the past, but were banned under the 1995 UN Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, which the United States acceded to on 21 January 2009. The PHASR rifle, a low-intensity laser, can skirt this regulation, as the blinding effect is apparently temporary. It also uses a two-wavelength laser. The PHASR was developed at Kirtland Air Force Base, part of the Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate in New Mexico.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/PHASR_Rifle.jpg/200px-PHASR_Rifle.jpg
