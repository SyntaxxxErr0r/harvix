1.00	Humberto_Gessinger	Humberto Gessinger	Humberto Gessinger (born December 24, 1963) is the singer and bassist of the Brazilian band Engenheiros do Hawaii. Gessinger was born in Porto Alegre, Brazil. In late 1984, he formed a rock band with two friends from the faculty of architecture at UFRGS, Carlos Maltz and Marcelo Pitz, to play in a parade made by students. The band decided to call themselves Engenheiros do Hawaii (Engineers from Hawaii), which was a name making fun of the surf wears that most of the Engineering students used to wear at the university campus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Humberto_Gessinger.JPG/220px-Humberto_Gessinger.JPG
