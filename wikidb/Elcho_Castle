2.10	Elcho_Castle	Elcho Castle	Elcho Castle is located a short distance above the south bank of the River Tay approximately four miles south-east of Perth, Scotland. It consists of a Z-plan tower house, with fragments of a surrounding wall with corner towers. The Castle was built on the site of an older structure about 1560, and is one of the best surviving examples of its date in Scotland. A large portion of the Castle is accessible, although floors in some rooms have fallen, and much of the building can be walked through. The wall-walk is accessible at two points.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Elcho_castle.jpg/270px-Elcho_castle.jpg
