2.00	Karamuru	Karamuru	Karamuru is a genus of prestosuchid archosaur from the Middle Triassic-age Santa Maria Formation of Brazil. It was found in the Paleorrota geopark. It is based on remains that had been assigned to Prestosuchus chininiquensis, including a nearly complete skull. There is some uncertainty about the publication date and authors; as noted by Langer et al. (2007), Kischlat (2000) records it as having been published by Kischlat and Barberena, with no year given. Later, Schultz and Langer considered it to be a junior synonym of Prestosuchus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Karamuru_museu1x.jpg/220px-Karamuru_museu1x.jpg
