15.01	Logic_synthesis	Logic synthesis	Logic operations usually consist of boolean AND, OR, XOR and NAND operations, and are the most basic forms of operations in an electronic circuit. Arithmetic operations are usually implemented with the use of logic operators. Circuits such as a binary multiplier or a binary adder are examples of more complex binary operations that can be implemented using basic logic operators.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Baops.gif/450px-Baops.gif
