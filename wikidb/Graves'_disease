57.4	Graves'_disease	Graves' disease	Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease where the thyroid is overactive, producing an excessive amount of thyroid hormones (a serious metabolic imbalance known as hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis). This is caused by thyroid autoantibodies (TSHR-Ab) that activate the TSH-receptor (TSHR), thereby stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, and thyroid growth (causing a diffusely enlarged goiter). The resulting state of hyperthyroidism can cause a dramatic constellation of neuropsychological and physical signs and symptoms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Proptosis_and_lid_retraction_from_Graves%27_Disease.jpg/230px-Proptosis_and_lid_retraction_from_Graves%27_Disease.jpg
