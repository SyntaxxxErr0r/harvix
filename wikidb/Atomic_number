55.4	Atomic_number	Atomic number	In chemistry and physics, the atomic number (also known as the proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an atom of neutral charge, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Atomic_number_depiction.jpg/300px-Atomic_number_depiction.jpg
