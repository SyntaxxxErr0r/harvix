55.1	Epiphany_(feeling)	Epiphany (feeling)	An epiphany (from the ancient Greek ἐπιφάνεια, epiphaneia, "manifestation, striking appearance") is the sudden realization or comprehension of the (larger) essence or meaning of something. The term is used in either a philosophical or literal sense to signify that the claimant has "found the last piece of the puzzle and now sees the whole picture," or has new information or experience, often insignificant by itself, that illuminates a deeper or numinous foundational frame of reference. This concept is studied by psychologists and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of innovation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Fry-lightbulb-on-forehead1.jpg/220px-Fry-lightbulb-on-forehead1.jpg
