85.0	Invasion_of_Grenada	Invasion of Grenada (1983)	The Invasion of Grenada, codenamed Operation Urgent Fury, was a 1983 United States-led invasion of Grenada, a Caribbean island nation with a population of about 100,000 located 100 miles (160 km) north of Venezuela. Triggered by a bloody military coup which had ousted a four-year revolutionary government, the invasion resulted in a restoration of constitutional government. It was controversial due to charges of American imperialism, Cold War politics, the involvement of Cuba, the unstable state of the Grenadian government, and Grenada's status as a Commonwealth realm. Media, outside the US, covered the invasion in a negative outlook despite the OAS request for intervention (on the request of the US Government), Soviet and Cuban presence on the island and the holding of American medical students at the True Blue Medical Facility.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/CH-53D_HMM-261_Grenada_Okt1983.jpeg/300px-CH-53D_HMM-261_Grenada_Okt1983.jpeg
