These workers are often represented by a company or an agency that resells their labor and that of others to its clients with or without project management and labor contributed by its regular employees. Others are completely independent. 'Independent contractor" would be the term used in a higher register of English.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/MODERN_DAY_FREELANCE_WRITING.jpg/230px-MODERN_DAY_FREELANCE_WRITING.jpg
