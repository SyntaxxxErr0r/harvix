64.8	Thangka	Thangka	A "Thangka," also known as "Tangka", "Thanka" or "Tanka" (Nepali pronunciation: ; Tibetan: ; Nepal Bhasa: पौभा) is a Tibetan silk painting with embroidery, usually depicting a Buddhist deity, scene, or mandala of some sort. The thankga is not a flat creation like an oil painting or acrylic painting but consists of a picture panel which is painted or embroidered over which a textile is mounted and then over which is laid a cover, usually silk. Generally, thankgas last a very long time and retain much of their lustre, but because of their delicate nature, they have to be kept in dry places where moisture won't affect the quality of the silk. It is sometimes called a scroll-painting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Shakyamuni-Thangka.jpg/350px-Shakyamuni-Thangka.jpg
