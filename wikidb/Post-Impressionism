51.6	Post-Impressionism	Post-Impressionism	Post-Impressionism is the term coined by the British artist and art critic Roger Fry in 1910 to describe the development of French art since Manet. Fry used the term when he organized the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists. Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, thick application of paint, distinctive brush strokes, and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Henri_Rousseau_007.jpg/300px-Henri_Rousseau_007.jpg
