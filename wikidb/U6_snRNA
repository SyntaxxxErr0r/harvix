1.00	U6_snRNA	U6 spliceosomal RNA	U6 snRNA is the non-coding small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of U6 snRNP , an RNA-protein complex that combines with other snRNPs, unmodified pre-mRNA, and various other proteins to assemble a spliceosome, a large RNA-protein molecular complex upon which splicing of pre-mRNA occurs. Splicing, or the removal of introns, is a major aspect of post-transcriptional modification, and takes place only in the nucleus of eukaryotes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/RF00026.jpg/220px-RF00026.jpg
