The name is also used for dye preparations derived from the plant, and for the art of temporary tattooing based on those dyes. Additionally, the name is misused for other skin and hair dyes, such as black henna or neutral henna, which are not derived from the plant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Lawsonia_inermis_Ypey36.jpg/240px-Lawsonia_inermis_Ypey36.jpg
