102.9	Translation	Translation	Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. Whereas interpreting undoubtedly antedates writing, translation began only after the appearance of written literature; there exist partial translations of the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh (ca. 2000 BCE) into Southwest Asian languages of the second millennium BCE.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Rosetta_Stone_BW.jpeg/125px-Rosetta_Stone_BW.jpeg
