55.4	San_Francisco_49ers	San Francisco 49ers	The San Francisco 49ers are a professional American football team based in San Francisco, California, playing in the West Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The team was founded in 1946 as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and joined the NFL in 1950 after the two leagues merged. The 49ers are well known for having one of the greatest dynasties in NFL and American sports history during the 1980s and early 1990s, winning five Super Bowl championships, including four in the 1980s. Those championship teams were led by notable hall of famers such as Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Steve Young, and coach Bill Walsh. They are currently second only to the Pittsburgh Steelers in total Super Bowl wins (6), tied with the Dallas Cowboys at 5. The 49ers won 10 or more games for 16 straight seasons. The 49ers remain the only team in NFL history to appear in more than one Super Bowl without ever losing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/49ers_Logo.svg/100px-49ers_Logo.svg.png
