54.9	Space-filling_curve	Space-filling curve	In mathematical analysis, a space-filling curve is a curve whose range contains the entire 2-dimensional unit square (or more generally an N-dimensional hypercube). Because Giuseppe Peano (1858â€“1932) was the first to discover one, space-filling curves in the 2-dimensional plane are commonly called Peano curves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Peanocurve.svg/400px-Peanocurve.svg.png
