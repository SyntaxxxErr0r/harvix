85.1	Bodhisattva	Bodhisattva	In Buddhism, a bodhisattva is either an enlightened (bodhi) existence (sattva) or an enlightenment-being or, given the variant Sanskrit spelling satva rather than sattva, "heroic-minded one (satva) for enlightenment (bodhi)." The Pali term has sometimes been translated as "wisdom-being," although in modern publications, and especially in tantric works, this is more commonly reserved for the term jñānasattva ("awareness-being"; Tib. ཡེ་ཤེས་སེམས་དཔའ་་, Wyl. ye shes sems dpa’). Traditionally, a bodhisattva is anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Twenty-Five_Bodhisattvas_Descending_from_Heaven%2C_c._1300.jpg/220px-Twenty-Five_Bodhisattvas_Descending_from_Heaven%2C_c._1300.jpg
