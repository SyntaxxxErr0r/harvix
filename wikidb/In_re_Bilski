66.1	In_re_Bilski	In re Bilski	In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2008), was an en banc decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) on the patenting of method claims, particularly business methods. The Federal Circuit court affirmed the rejection of the patent claims involving a method of hedging risks in commodities trading. The court also reiterated the machine-or-transformation test as the applicable test for patent-eligible subject matter, and stated that the test in State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group should no longer be relied upon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/US-CourtOfAppeals-FederalCircuit-Seal.svg/200px-US-CourtOfAppeals-FederalCircuit-Seal.svg.png
