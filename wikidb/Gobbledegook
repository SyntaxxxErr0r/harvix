3.30	Gobbledegook	Gobbledygook	Gobbledygook or gobbledegook (sometimes gobbledegoo) is any text containing jargon or especially convoluted English that results in it being excessively hard to understand or even incomprehensible. "Bureaucratese" is one form of gobbledygook. There are two distinct and opposite cases. One is that incomprehensible material is actual gibberish. In the other some abtruse material is either ineptly presented or is subjectively perceived to be gibberish due to a lack of preparation. The SMOG statistic for gobbledygook for example yields an index in terms of years of required education.
