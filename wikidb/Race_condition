102.5	Race_condition	Race condition	A race condition or race hazard is a flaw in an electronic system or process whereby the output or result of the process is unexpectedly and critically dependent on the sequence or timing of other events. The term originates with the idea of two signals racing each other to influence the output first.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Race_condition.svg/262px-Race_condition.svg.png
