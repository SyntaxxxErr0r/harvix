68.7	Via_ferrata	Via ferrata	A via ferrata (Italian for "road of iron") or klettersteig (German for "climbing path") is a mountain route which is equipped with fixed cables, stemples, ladders, and bridges. The use of these allows otherwise isolated routes to be joined to create longer routes which are accessible to people with a wide range of climbing abilities. Walkers and climbers can follow vie ferrate without needing to use their own ropes and belays, and without the risks associated with unprotected scrambling and climbing. They are found in a number of European countries, including Italy, Germany, England, Scotland, Wales, France, Austria, Slovenia, Romania, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Norway and a few places in the United States, Canada, Iran, Malaysia and Singapore. The first via ferrate were built in the Dolomite mountain region of Italy during the First World War, to aid the movement of the Italian mountain infantry. The world's highest via ferrata, at 3,800 metres, is located at Mount Kinabalu in the state of Sabah, Malaysia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Hermann_von_Barth_Weg_MQ.jpg/250px-Hermann_von_Barth_Weg_MQ.jpg
