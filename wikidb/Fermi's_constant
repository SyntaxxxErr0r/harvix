3.00	Fermi's_constant	Fermi's interaction	In particle physics, Fermi's interaction also known as Fermi coupling, is an old explanation of the weak force, proposed by Enrico Fermi, in which four fermions directly interact with one another at one vertex. For example, this interaction explains beta decay of a neutron by direct coupling of a neutron (two down quarks and an up quark) with an electron, antineutrino and a proton (two up quarks and a down quark). The interaction could also explain muon decay via a coupling of a muon, electron-antineutrino, muon-antineutrino and electron. Fermi first introduced this coupling in his description of beta decay in 1933.
