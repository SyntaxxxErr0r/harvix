58.5	Artificial_life	Artificial life	Artificial life (often abbreviated ALife or A-Life}) is a field of study and an associated art form which examine systems related to life, its processes, and its evolution through simulations using computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. The discipline was named by Christopher Langton, an American computer scientist, in 1986. There are three main kinds of alife, named for their approaches: soft, from software; hard, from hardware; and wet, from biochemistry. Artificial life imitates traditional biology by trying to recreate biological phenomena. The term "artificial life" is often used to specifically refer to soft alife.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Braitenberg.jpg/250px-Braitenberg.jpg
