52.8	Kidney_stone	Kidney stone	A kidney stone, also known as a renal calculus (from the Latin ren, "kidney" and calculus, "pebble") is a solid concretion or crystal aggregation formed in the kidneys from dietary minerals in the urine. Urinary stones are typically classified by their location in the kidney (nephrolithiasis), ureter (ureterolithiasis), or bladder , or by their chemical composition (calcium-containing, struvite, uric acid, or other compounds). Kidney stones are a significant source of morbidity. 80% of those with kidney stones are men. Men most commonly experience their first episode between age 30â€“40 years, while for women the age at first presentation is somewhat later.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Nefrolit.jpg/230px-Nefrolit.jpg
