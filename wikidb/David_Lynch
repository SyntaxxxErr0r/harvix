206.8	David_Lynch	David Lynch	David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, television director, visual artist, comic book artist, musician and occasional actor. Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed "Lynchian", and which is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. The surreal, and in many cases violent, elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they "disturb, offend or mystify" their audiences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/David_lynch_grayscale.jpg/220px-David_lynch_grayscale.jpg
