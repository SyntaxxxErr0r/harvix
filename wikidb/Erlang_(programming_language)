152.6	Erlang_(programming_language)	Erlang (programming language)	Erlang is a general-purpose concurrent, garbage-collected programming language and runtime system. The sequential subset of Erlang is a functional language, with strict evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. For concurrency it follows the Actor model. It was designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications. It supports hot swapping, so that code can be changed without stopping a system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Erlang_logo.png/118px-Erlang_logo.png
