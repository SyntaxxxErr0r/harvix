140.6	Thermodynamics	Thermodynamics	Thermodynamics is the branch of physical science concerned with heat and its relation to other forms of energy and work. It defines macroscopic variables (such as temperature, entropy, and pressure) that describe average properties of material bodies and radiation, and explains how they are related and by what laws they change with time. Thermodynamics does not describe the microscopic constituents of matter, and its laws can be derived from statistical mechanics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Carnot_engine_%28hot_body_-_working_body_-_cold_body%29.jpg/220px-Carnot_engine_%28hot_body_-_working_body_-_cold_body%29.jpg
