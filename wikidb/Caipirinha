98.1	Caipirinha	Caipirinha	Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail, made with cachaça (sugar cane rum), sugar (preferably white powdered sugar, or any other sugar, even honey) and lime. Cachaça is Brazil's most common distilled alcoholic beverage (also known as Pinga or Caninha). Both rum and cachaça are made from sugarcane-derived products. Specifically with cachaça, the alcohol results from the fermentation of sugarcane juice that is afterwards distilled.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Caipirinha2.jpg/220px-Caipirinha2.jpg
