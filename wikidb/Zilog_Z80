It was widely used both in desktop and embedded computer designs as well as for military purposes. The Z80 and its derivatives and clones make up one of the most commonly used CPU families of all time, and, along with the MOS Technology 6502 family, dominated the 8-bit microcomputer market from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Zilog_Z80.jpg/220px-Zilog_Z80.jpg
