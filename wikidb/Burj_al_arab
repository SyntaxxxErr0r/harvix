Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island 280 m (920 ft) out from Jumeirah beach, and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. The shape of the structure is designed to mimic the sail of a ship. Sometimes described as "the world's only seven-Star hotel", its star rating has been often debated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Burj_Al_Arab_Dubai.jpg/240px-Burj_Al_Arab_Dubai.jpg
