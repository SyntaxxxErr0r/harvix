88.0	Advent_calendar	Advent calendar	An Advent calendar is a special calendar which is used to count or celebrate the days of Advent in anticipation of Christmas. Some calendars are strictly religious, whereas others are secular in content. Despite the name, most commercially available Advent calendars begin on December 1, regardless of when Advent begins, which can be as early as November 27 and as late as December 3.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Rathaus_H%C3%BCnfeld_Adventskalender.JPG/220px-Rathaus_H%C3%BCnfeld_Adventskalender.JPG
