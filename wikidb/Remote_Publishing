4.00	Remote_Publishing	Web-to-print	Web-to-print, also known as Web2Print or remote publishing, is a commercial prepress process that bridges the gap between digital content online and commercial print production. This process allows a print house, a client, and possibly a graphic designer to create, edit, and approve computer-based online templates during the prepress phase. This process increasingly calls for a Portable Document Format (PDF) workflow environment with output provided by digital printing; although there is certainly no requirement that fulfillment be accomplished using digital production equipment; Web-to-print is also used today by printers with both offset and digital production facilities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Web_to_print_logo_%28black%29.svg/120px-Web_to_print_logo_%28black%29.svg.png
