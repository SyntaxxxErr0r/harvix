1.00	RealThings	RealThings	IBM RealThings is a software interface design methodology proposed by IBM in 1998. Instead of using traditional computer-based elements, RealThings proposes that images of physical real-life objects are used instead. This was aimed to be more “natural and intuitive, allowing users to focus more on their tasks and less on computer artefacts.”	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/RealPhone.gif/220px-RealPhone.gif
