3.00	Firmicute	Firmicutes	The Firmicutes (Latin: firmus, strong, and cutis, skin , referring to the cell wall) are a phylum of bacteria, most of which have Gram-positive cell wall structure. A few, however, such as Megasphaera, Pectinatus, Selenomonas and Zymophilus, have a porous pseudo-outer-membrane that causes them to stain Gram-negative. Scientists once classified the Firmicutes to include all Gram-positive bacteria, but have recently defined them to be of a core group of related forms called the low-G+C group, in contrast to the Actinobacteria. They have round cells, called cocci (singular coccus), or rod-like forms (bacillus).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Bacillus_subtilis_Gram.jpg/220px-Bacillus_subtilis_Gram.jpg
