98.7	Tumor	Tumor	A tumor or tumour is commonly used as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled (cystic) lesion that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size. Tumor is not synonymous with cancer. While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be benign, pre-malignant, or malignant, or can represent a lesion without any cancerous potential whatsoever.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Hidradenoma.jpg/200px-Hidradenoma.jpg
