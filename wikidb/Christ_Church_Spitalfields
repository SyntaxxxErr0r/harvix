Situated on Commercial Street, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, on the eastern border and facing the City of London, it was one of the first (and arguably one of the finest) of the so-called "Commissioners' Churches" built for the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, which had been established by an Act of Parliament in 1711.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Ch_ch_spitalfields.400px.jpg/220px-Ch_ch_spitalfields.400px.jpg
