It is executed from a running or jumping position, using momentum and weight to impact the opponent, and most variations can seamlessly transition into a pin. This attack is a plancha in lucha libre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Razor_Ramon_HG_Bronco_Buster.jpg/220px-Razor_Ramon_HG_Bronco_Buster.jpg
