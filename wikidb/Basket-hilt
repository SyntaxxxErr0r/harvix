1.00	Basket-hilt	Basket-hilted sword	The basket-hilted sword is the name of a group of early modern sword types characterized by a basket-shaped guard that protects the hand. The basket hilt is a development of the quillons added to swords' crossguards since the Late Middle Ages. Also known as the broadsword, the basket-hilted sword was a military sword, termed "broad" in contrast with the rapier, the slim dueling sword worn with civilian dress during the same period.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Schiavona-Morges.jpg/220px-Schiavona-Morges.jpg
