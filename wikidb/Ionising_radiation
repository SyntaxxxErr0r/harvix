6.42	Ionising_radiation	Ionizing radiation	Ionizing (or ionising) radiation is radiation composed of particles that individually can liberate an electron from an atom or molecule, producing ions, which are atoms or molecules with a net electric charge. These tend to be especially chemically reactive, and the reactivity produces the high biological damage caused per unit of energy of ionizing radiation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/220px-Radioactive.svg.png
