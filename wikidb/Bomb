52.1	Bomb	Bomb	A bomb is any of a range (short or long distance) of explosive weapons that only rely on the exothermic reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy. Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress, the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects. A nuclear weapon employs chemical-based explosives to initiate a much larger nuclear-based explosion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/MOAB_bomb.jpg/200px-MOAB_bomb.jpg
