79.9	Low_Earth_orbit	Low Earth orbit	A low Earth orbit is generally defined as an orbit below an altitude of 2,000 km. Given the rapid orbital decay of objects below approximately 200 km, the commonly accepted definition for LEO is between 160–2,000 km (100–1,240 miles) above the Earth's surface. The speed needed to achieve a stable low earth orbit is about 7.8 km/s, but reduces with altitude.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Newton_Cannon.svg/220px-Newton_Cannon.svg.png
