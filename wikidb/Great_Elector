2.00	Great_Elector	Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg	Frederick William (German: ) (16 February 1620 – 29 April 1688) was Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia – and thus ruler of Brandenburg-Prussia – from 1640 until his death. A member of the House of Hohenzollern, he is popularly known as "The Great Elector" (German: ) because of his military and political prowess. Frederick William was a staunch pillar of the Calvinist faith, associated with the rising commercial class. He saw the importance of trade and promoted it vigorously. His shrewd domestic reforms gave Prussia a strong position in the post-Westphalia political order of north-central Europe, setting Prussia up for elevation from duchy to kingdom, achieved under his successor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Charlottenburg_Statue_2.jpg/220px-Charlottenburg_Statue_2.jpg
