1.21	Genesis_spacecraft	Genesis (spacecraft)	The Genesis spacecraft was a NASA sample return probe which collected a sample of solar wind and returned it to Earth for analysis. It was the first NASA sample return mission to return material since the Apollo Program, and the first to return material from beyond the orbit of the Moon. Genesis was launched on August 8, 2001, and crash-landed in Utah on September 8, 2004, after a design flaw prevented the deployment of its drogue parachute. The crash contaminated many of the sample collectors, but although most were damaged, many of the collectors were successfully recovered.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Genesis_in_collection_mode.jpg/290px-Genesis_in_collection_mode.jpg
