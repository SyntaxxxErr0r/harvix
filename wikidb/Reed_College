Founded in 1908, Reed is a residential college with a campus located in Portland's Eastmoreland neighborhood, featuring architecture based on the Tudor-Gothic style, and a forested canyon wilderness preserve at its center. Reed is known for its mandatory freshman humanities program, for its required senior-year thesis, as the only private undergraduate college with a primarily student-run nuclear reactor supporting its science programs, and for the unusually high proportion of graduates who go on to earn PhDs and other postgraduate degrees.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c0/Reed_College_griffin.svg/120px-Reed_College_griffin.svg.png
