6.10	Eric_Matthews_(Saw)	Eric Matthews (Saw)	Eric Matthews (originally scripted to be named Eric Mason) is a fictional character from the Saw franchise, who first appeared in a fake documentary entitled, Full Disclosure Report: Piecing Together Jigsaw, featured on the Uncut Edition of the original film. He is the main protagonist of Saw II and a supporting character in both Saw III and Saw IV. It was originally stated that Donnie Wahlberg (who portrayed Eric Matthews) would not be reprising his role in Saw III due to creative differences, but this turned out to be a hoax conceived by Lions Gate Entertainment to throw off fans of the series trying to dig up details on the film.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/S3eric3.jpg/220px-S3eric3.jpg
