80.1	Alpha_Centauri	Alpha Centauri	Alpha Centauri is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Centaurus. Although it appears to the unaided eye as a single object, Alpha Centauri is actually a binary star system (designated Alpha Centauri AB or Î± Cen AB) whose combined visual magnitude of -0.27 would qualify it as the third single brightest star in the night sky after -0.72 magnitude Canopus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Alpha_centauri.png
