12.40	Ralph_Vaughn_Williams	Ralph Vaughan Williams	Ralph Vaughan Williams OM (12 October 1872 â€“ 26 August 1958) was an English composer of symphonies, chamber music, opera, choral music, and film scores. He was also a collector of English folk music and song: this activity both influenced his editorial approach to the English Hymnal, beginning in 1904, in which he included many folk song arrangements set as hymn tunes, and also influenced several of his own original compositions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7d/Vaughan-Williams-by-Rothenstein.jpg/170px-Vaughan-Williams-by-Rothenstein.jpg
