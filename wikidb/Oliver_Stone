127.0	Oliver_Stone	Oliver Stone	William Oliver Stone (born September 15, 1946) is an American film director, producer and screenwriter. Stone became well known in the late 1980s and the early 1990s for directing a series of films about the Vietnam War, in which he had previously participated as an infantry soldier. His work frequently focuses on contemporary political and cultural issues, often controversially. He has received three Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay for Midnight Express (1978), and Best Director for Platoon (1986) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). The British newspaper The Guardian described Stone as "one of the few committed men of the left working in mainstream American cinema." Stone's films often use many different cameras and film formats, including VHS, 8 mm film, and 70 mm film. He sometimes uses several formats in a single scene, as in JFK (1991) and Natural Born Killers (1994).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Oliver_Stone_cropped_2009.jpg/200px-Oliver_Stone_cropped_2009.jpg
