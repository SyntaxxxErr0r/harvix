2.00	The_Soldier's_Song	Amhrán na bhFiann	(English: "The Soldiers' Song") is the Irish national anthem. The music was composed by Peadar Kearney and Patrick Heeney, the original English lyrics (as "A Soldiers' Song") by Kearney, and the Irish language translation by Liam Ó Rinn. The song has three verses, but the national anthem consists of the chorus only. The Presidential Salute, played when the President of Ireland arrives at an official engagement, consists of the first four bars of the national anthem immediately followed by the last five.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/%C3%93glaigh_na_h%C3%89ireann.jpg
