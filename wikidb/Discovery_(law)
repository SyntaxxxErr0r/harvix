62.9	Discovery_(law)	Discovery (law)	In U.S.law, discovery is the pre-trial phase in a lawsuit in which each party, through the law of civil procedure, can obtain evidence from the opposing party by means of discovery devices including requests for answers to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, requests for admissions and depositions. Discovery can be obtained from non-parties using subpoenas. When discovery requests are objected to, the requesting party may seek the assistance of the court by filing a motion to compel discovery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/FedStat_Court_Res1.jpg/500px-FedStat_Court_Res1.jpg
