4.30	Problem_of_hell	Problem of Hell	The "Problem of Hell" is a possible ethical problem related to religions in which portrayals of Hell are ostensibly cruel, and are thus inconsistent with the concepts of a just, moral and omnibenevolent God. The problem of Hell revolves around four key points: it exists in the first place, some people go there, there is no escape, and it is punishment for actions or inactions done on Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Ephesians_2%2C12_-_Greek_atheos.jpg/200px-Ephesians_2%2C12_-_Greek_atheos.jpg
