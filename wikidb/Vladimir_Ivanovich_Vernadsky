13.01	Vladimir_Ivanovich_Vernadsky	Vladimir Vernadsky	Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky (Russian: , Ukrainian: ; 12 March 1863 – 6 January 1945) was a Ukrainian and Soviet mineralogist and geochemist who is considered one of the founders of geochemistry, biogeochemistry, and of radiogeology. His ideas of noosphere were an important contribution to Russian cosmism. He also worked in Ukraine where he founded the National Academy of Science of Ukraine. He is most noted for his 1926 book The Biosphere in which he inadvertently worked to popularize Eduard Suess’ 1885 term biosphere, by hypothesizing that life is the geological force that shapes the earth. In 1943 he was awarded the Stalin Prize.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Vernadsky.jpg
