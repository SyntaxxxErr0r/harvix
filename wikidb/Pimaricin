2.10	Pimaricin	Natamycin	Natamycin , also known as pimaricin, is a naturally occurring antifungal agent produced during fermentation by the bacterium Streptomyces natalensis, commonly found in soil. Natamycin has a very low solubility in water; however, natamycin is effective at very low levels. Most molds have an MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of less than 10 ppm. Natamycin is classified as a macrolide polyene antifungal and, as a drug, is used to treat fungal keratitis. It is especially effective against Aspergillus and Fusarium corneal infections. Other common members of the polyene macrolide antifungal family are amphotericin B, nystatin, and filipin. Natamycin is also used in the food industry as a "natural" preservative.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Natamycin.svg/220px-Natamycin.svg.png
