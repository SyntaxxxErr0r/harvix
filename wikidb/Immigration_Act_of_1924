78.5	Immigration_Act_of_1924	Immigration Act of 1924	The Immigration Act of 1924, or Johnsonâ€“Reed Act, including the National Origins Act, and Asian Exclusion Act (Pub.L. 68-139, 43 Stat. 153, enacted May 26, 1924), was a United States federal law that limited the annual number of immigrants who could be admitted from any country to 2% of the number of people from that country who were already living in the United States in 1890, down from the 3% cap set by the Immigration Restriction Act of 1921, according to the Census of 1890. It superseded the 1921 Emergency Quota Act. The law was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans who were immigrating in large numbers starting in the 1890s, as well as prohibiting the immigration of Middle Easterners, East Asians and Asian Indians. According to the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, "In all its parts, the most basic purpose of the 1924 Immigration Act was to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity." Congressional opposition was minimal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/CalvinCoolidgeimmigration3.jpg/220px-CalvinCoolidgeimmigration3.jpg
