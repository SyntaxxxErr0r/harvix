1.03	Volcanism_in_Canada	Volcanism of Canada	Volcanism of Canada has produced lava flows, lava plateaus, lava domes, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, submarine volcanoes, calderas, diatremes, and maars, along with examples of more less common volcanic forms such as tuyas and subglacial mounds. It has a very complex volcanological history spanning from the Precambrian period at least 3.11 billion years ago when this part of the North American continent began to form.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Mount_Edziza%2C_British_Columbia.jpg/256px-Mount_Edziza%2C_British_Columbia.jpg
