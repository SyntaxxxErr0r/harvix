2.00	Corsican_Mafia	Unione Corse	The Unione Corse is a secretive criminal organization operating primarily out of Corsica and Marseilles in France. Unlike the Sicilian Mafia, it has not attempted to gain a foothold in the United States, and thus does not have the other organization's notoriety. "Unione Corse" is the general name given by French and American authorities to the major Corsican gangs who organized the French Connection, the heroin trade between France and the U.S. from the 1950s to the early 1970s.
