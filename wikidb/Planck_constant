87.4	Planck_constant	Planck constant	The Planck constant (denoted h, also called Planck's constant) is a physical constant reflecting the sizes of energy quanta in quantum mechanics. It is named after Max Planck, one of the founders of quantum theory, who discovered it in 1900. Classical statistical mechanics requires the existence of h (but does not define its value).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/MaxPlanckWirkungsquantums20050815_CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg/220px-MaxPlanckWirkungsquantums20050815_CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg
