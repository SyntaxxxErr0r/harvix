10.60	Extension_(kinesiology)	Extension (kinesiology)	In kinesiology, extension is a movement of a joint that results in increased angle between two bones or body surfaces at a joint. Extension usually results in straightening of the bones or body surfaces involved. For example, extension is produced by extending the flexed (bent) elbow. Straightening of the arm would require extension at the elbow joint. If the head is tilted all the way back, the neck is said to be extended.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Human_anatomy_planes.svg/220px-Human_anatomy_planes.svg.png
