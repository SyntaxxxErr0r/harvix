115.7	Dimethyltryptamine	Dimethyltryptamine	N,N-Dimethyltryptamine is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound of the tryptamine family. DMT is ubiquitous in plants. It occurs as trace amounts in mammals, including humans, where it may putatively function as a trace amine neurotransmitter. It is originally derived from the essential amino acid tryptophan and ultimately produced by the enzyme INMT during normal metabolism. The significance of its widespread natural presence remains undetermined. Structurally, DMT is analogous to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT), the hormone melatonin, and other psychedelic tryptamines, such as 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenin, and psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/DMT.svg/200px-DMT.svg.png
