8.02	Absorbent_glass_mat	VRLA battery	A VRLA battery more commonly known as a sealed battery is a leadâ€“acid rechargeable battery. Because of their construction, VRLA batteries do not require regular addition of water to the cells, and vent less gas than flooded lead-acid batteries. The reduced venting is an advantage since they can be used in confined or badly ventilated spaces. But sealing cells and preventing access to the electrolyte also has several considerable disadvantages as discussed below.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Lead_acid_cell.svg/200px-Lead_acid_cell.svg.png
