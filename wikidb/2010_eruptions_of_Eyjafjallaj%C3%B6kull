107.8	2010_eruptions_of_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull	2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull	The 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull were volcanic events at Eyjafjöll in Iceland which, although relatively small for volcanic eruptions, caused enormous disruption to air travel across western and northern Europe over an initial period of six days in April 2010. Additional localised disruption continued into May 2010. The eruption was declared officially over in October 2010, when snow on the glacier did not melt. From 14–20 April, ash covered large areas of northern Europe when the volcano erupted. About 20 countries closed their airspace (a condition known as ATC Zero) and it affected hundreds of thousands of travellers. The grounding of European flights avoided about 344106 kg of CO2 emissions per day, while the volcano emitted about 150106 kg of CO2 per day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Eyjafjallajokull_volcano_plume_2010_04_18.JPG/250px-Eyjafjallajokull_volcano_plume_2010_04_18.JPG
