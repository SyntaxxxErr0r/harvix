56.4	Intercontinental_ballistic_missile	Intercontinental ballistic missile	An intercontinental ballistic missile is a ballistic missile with a long range (greater than 5,500 km or 3,500 miles) typically designed for nuclear weapons delivery (delivering one or more nuclear warheads). Most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to carry several warheads, each of which can strike a different target.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Titan_II_launch.jpg/220px-Titan_II_launch.jpg
