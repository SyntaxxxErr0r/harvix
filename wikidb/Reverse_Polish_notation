107.4	Reverse_Polish_notation	Reverse Polish notation	Reverse Polish notation is a mathematical notation wherein every operator follows all of its operands, in contrast to Polish notation, which puts the operator in the prefix position. It is also known as Postfix notation and is parenthesis-free as long as operator arities are fixed. The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan ≈Åukasiewicz, who invented (prefix) Polish notation in the 1920s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Postfix-dia.svg/125px-Postfix-dia.svg.png
