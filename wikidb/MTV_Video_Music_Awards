60.1	MTV_Video_Music_Awards	MTV Video Music Award	An MTV Video Music Award (commonly abbreviated as a VMA), is an award presented by the cable channel MTV to honor the best in music videos. Originally conceived as an alternative to the Grammy Awards (in the video category), the annual MTV Video Music Awards ceremony has often been called the "Oscars for youth", an acknowledgment of the VMA ceremony's ability to draw millions of youth from teens to 20-somethings each year. By 2001, the VMA had become a coveted award. The statue given to winners is an astronaut on the moon, one of the earliest representations of MTV.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Radio_City_Music_Hall_2003.jpg/150px-Radio_City_Music_Hall_2003.jpg
