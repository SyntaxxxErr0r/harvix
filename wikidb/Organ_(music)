57.1	Organ_(music)	Organ (music)	The organ (from Greek όργανον organon, "organ, instrument, tool"), is a keyboard instrument of one or more divisions, each played with its own keyboard operated either with the hands or with the feet. The organ is a relatively old musical instrument in the Western musical tradition, dating from the time of Ctesibius of Alexandria who is credited with the invention of the hydraulis. By around the 8th century it had overcome early associations with gladiatorial combat and gradually assumed a prominent place in the liturgy of the Catholic Church; subsequently it has re-emerged as a secular and recital instrument.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/OrgueSaintThomasStrasbourg.jpg/250px-OrgueSaintThomasStrasbourg.jpg
