57.1	Gossip	Gossip	Gossip is idle talk or rumour about the personal or private affairs of others. It is one of the oldest and most common means of sharing facts and views, but also has a reputation for the introduction of errors and variations into the information transmitted. The term can also imply that the idle chat or rumour is of personal or trivial nature, as opposed to normal conversation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/No_chat.jpg/225px-No_chat.jpg
