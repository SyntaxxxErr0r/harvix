236.6	Organic_light-emitting_diode	OLED	An OLED is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compounds which emit light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor material is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/OLED_EarlyProduct.JPG/220px-OLED_EarlyProduct.JPG
