1.00	Hand_%26_Foot	Canasta	Canasta (Spanish for "basket") is a card game of the rummy family of games believed to be a variant of 500 Rum. Although many variations exist for 2, 3, 5 or 6 players, it is most commonly played by four in two partnerships with two standard decks of cards. Players attempt to make melds of 7 cards of the same rank and "go out" by playing all cards in their hand. It is the only partnership member of the family of Rummy games to achieve the status of a classic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Canasta.jpg/250px-Canasta.jpg
