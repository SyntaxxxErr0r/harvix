4.10	G%C3%A4nseliesel	Gänseliesel	The Gänseliesel (English: Goose Girl, Goose Lizzy (Liesel as pet name of Elisabeth)) is a fountain which was erected in 1901 in front of the mediaeval town hall of Göttingen, Germany. Although rather small in size, the fountain is the most well-known landmark of the city. Today, it is an essential part of the graduation celebrations for every student who finishes a doctorate at the George August University Göttingen to climb the fountain and to kiss the statue of the goose girl.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/G%C3%B6ttingen_G%C3%A4nseliesel_M%C3%A4rz06.jpg/220px-G%C3%B6ttingen_G%C3%A4nseliesel_M%C3%A4rz06.jpg
