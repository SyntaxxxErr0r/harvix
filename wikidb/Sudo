94.7	Sudo	sudo	sudo ( or ) is a program for Unix-like computer operating systems that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user (normally the superuser, or root). Its name is a concatenation of the su command (which grants the user a shell of another user, normally the superuser) and "do", or take action.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Sudo_on_Ubuntu.png/300px-Sudo_on_Ubuntu.png
