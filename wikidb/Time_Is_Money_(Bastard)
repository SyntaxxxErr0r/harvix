1.10	Time_Is_Money_(Bastard)	Time Is Money (Bastard)	Time Is Money (Bastard) is the fifth release by the New York No Wave band Swans. Notable for the first official appearance of Jarboe, this single also marks a turning point in the band's sound, moving away from the slow, churning noise rock of their early work to a more minimal, industrial sound. Both mixes of the title song utilise sampled beats (in this case a nail gun) in addition to live drums; the result is almost dancey. The down-tempo B-side "Sealed in Skin", however, pushes the band's sound even farther as the first in their catalogue to use piano.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fa/Timeismoneybastard.jpg/220px-Timeismoneybastard.jpg
