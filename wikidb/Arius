52.1	Arius	Arius	Arius (Ἄρειος, AD 250 or 256 – 336) was a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt of Libyan origins. His teachings about the nature of the Godhead, which emphasized the Father's divinity over the Son, and his opposition to the Athanasian or Trinitarian Christology, made him a controversial figure in the First Council of Nicea, convened by Roman Emperor Constantine in AD 325.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Nikea-arius.png/220px-Nikea-arius.png
