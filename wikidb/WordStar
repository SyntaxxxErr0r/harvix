96.3	WordStar	WordStar	WordStar is a word processor application, published by MicroPro International, originally written for the CP/M operating system but later ported to DOS, that enjoyed a dominant market share during the early- to mid-1980s. Although Seymour I. Rubinstein was the principal owner of the company, Rob Barnaby was the sole author of the early versions of the program; starting with WordStar 4.0, the program was built on new code written principally by Peter Mierau.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/WordStar_4_CPM.JPG/220px-WordStar_4_CPM.JPG
