2.10	Luxembourg_Grand_Prix	Luxembourg Grand Prix	The Luxembourg Grand Prix (Gro√üer Preis von Luxemburg) was the name given to two races of the FIA Formula One World Championship, held in 1997 and 1998. The FIA rulings for Formula One stipulate that no country be allowed more than one race. However, the FIA has got around this ruling in the past by running Grands Prix under another name; although the Imola circuit is not in San Marino, races held there have been run under the title of the San Marino Grand Prix as the circuit is nearby.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Nurburgring_1995.jpg/200px-Nurburgring_1995.jpg
