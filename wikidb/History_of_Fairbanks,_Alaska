3.10	History_of_Fairbanks,_Alaska	History of Fairbanks, Alaska	The history of Fairbanks, the second-largest city in Alaska, can be traced to the founding of a trading post by E.T. Barnette on the south bank of the Chena River on August 26, 1901. The area had seen human occupation since at least the last ice age, but a permanent settlement was not established at the site of Fairbanks until the 20th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/135px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png
