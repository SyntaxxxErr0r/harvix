121.1	Cuban_Missile_Crisis	Cuban Missile Crisis	The thirteen days referred to as the Cuban Missile Crisis (known as the October Crisis in Cuba or Caribbean Crisis , the Cuban and Soviet governments secretly began to build bases in Cuba for a number of medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) with the ability to strike most of the continental United States. This action followed the 1958 deployment of Thor IRBMs in the UK (Project Emily) and Jupiter IRBMs to Italy and Turkey in 1961 â€“ more than 100 US-built missiles having the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads. On October 14, 1962, a United States Air Force U-2 plane on a photoreconnaissance mission captured photographic proof of Soviet missile bases under construction in Cuba.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Soviet-R-12-nuclear-ballistic_missile.jpg/300px-Soviet-R-12-nuclear-ballistic_missile.jpg
