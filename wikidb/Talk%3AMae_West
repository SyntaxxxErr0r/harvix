1.00	Talk%3AMae_West	Talk:Mae West	Free images of West are extremely rare. Images of her in public in her later years are practically non-existent, free or not. These two images have recently been exchanged back and forth, so that either one or the other has remained in the article, but not both. I believe both images are of interest and value and have their places. Even though the 1978 image is in poor focus, it is probably the last (only?) portrait (for lack of a better word) that exists of West in public wearing her diamonds, with a late 1970's hairstyle. I am reverting the latest edit, enabling both images to remain.
