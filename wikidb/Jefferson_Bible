75.1	Jefferson_Bible	Jefferson Bible	The Jefferson Bible, or The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth as it is formally titled, was a book constructed by Thomas Jefferson in the latter years of his life by cutting and pasting numerous sections from various Bibles as extractions of the doctrine of Jesus. Jefferson's composition excluded sections of the New Testament containing supernatural aspects as well as perceived misinterpretations he believed had been added by the Four Evangelists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Jefferson_Bible_6Verso_7Recto.jpg/220px-Jefferson_Bible_6Verso_7Recto.jpg
