62.4	YAGNI	You ain't gonna need it	"You ain't gonna need it" or “You aren′t gonna need it” (acronym: YAGNI) is the principle in extreme programming that programmers should not add functionality until it is necessary. Ron Jeffries writes, "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."
