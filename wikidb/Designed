4.20	Designed	Design	Design as a noun informally refers to a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawing, business process, circuit diagrams and sewing patterns) while "to design" (verb) refers to making this plan. No generally-accepted definition of "design" exists, and the term has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below). However, one can also design by directly constructing an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, cowboy coding and graphic design).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/All_Saints_Chapel--L.C._Tiffany.JPG/330px-All_Saints_Chapel--L.C._Tiffany.JPG
