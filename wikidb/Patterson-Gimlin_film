51.4	Patterson-Gimlin_film	Patterson-Gimlin film	The Patterson-Gimlin film (also referred to as simply the Patterson film) is a famous short motion picture of an unidentified subject the film makers purported to be a "Bigfoot", that was supposedly filmed on October 20, 1967, by Roger Patterson (February 14, 1926 â€“ January 15, 1972) and Robert Gimlin (October 18, 1931) on the Klamath River outside of Orleans, California. The film has been subjected to many attempts both to debunk and authenticate it. Most scientists have judged the film a hoax with a man in an ape suit, but other theorists contend the film depicts a cryptid, a creature unknown to science.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/25/Smalfut.jpg
