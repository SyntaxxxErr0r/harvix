12.42	List_of_defunct_hard_disk_manufacturers	List of defunct hard disk manufacturers	It has been estimated that over 200 companies were hard disk drive manufacturers at one time or another. Besides competing on features such as hard disk (HDD) data density and latencies, many of those companies started to support new, smaller form factors that enabled the ever-reducing physical sizes of computing devices. Most of that industry has been reduced to five strong vendors through bankruptcy and acquisition. As of 2011, these vendors are (alphabetically): HGST, Samsung, Seagate, Simmtronics, Toshiba and Western Digital. The first two of these may be acquired later in 2011, which would result in only four manufacturers of hard drives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Diagram_of_Hard_Disk_Drive_Manufacturer_Consolidation.svg/300px-Diagram_of_Hard_Disk_Drive_Manufacturer_Consolidation.svg.png
