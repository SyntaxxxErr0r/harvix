135.2	Serial_ATA	Serial ATA	Serial ATA is a computer bus interface for connecting host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives and optical drives. Serial ATA was designed to replace the older parallel ATA (PATA) standard (often called by the old name IDE), offering several advantages over the older interface: reduced cable size and cost (7 conductors instead of 40), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signalling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Serial_ATA.svg/120px-Serial_ATA.svg.png
