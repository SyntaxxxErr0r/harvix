55.1	John_C._Fr%C3%A9mont	John C. Frémont	John Charles Frémont (January 21, 1813 – July 13, 1890), was an American military officer, explorer, and the first candidate of the anti-slavery Republican Party for the office of President of the United States. During the 1840s, that era's penny press accorded Frémont the sobriquet The Pathfinder. It remains in use, and he is sometimes called The Great Pathfinder. He retired from the military and moved to the new territory California, after leading a fourth expedition which cost ten lives seeking a rail route over the mountains around the 38th parallel in the winter of 1849.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/JohnCharlesFr%C3%A9mont.png/200px-JohnCharlesFr%C3%A9mont.png
