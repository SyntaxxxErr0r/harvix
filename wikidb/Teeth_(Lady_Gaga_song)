1.00	Teeth_(Lady_Gaga_song)	The Fame Monster	The Fame Monster is the third EP and second major release by American recording artist Lady Gaga. It was released on November 18, 2009 through Interscope Records. Initially planned to be included on a re-release of Gaga's debut studio album, The Fame, she announced that the eight tracks would be included on a standalone release, saying that she thought the re-release was too expensive and that the albums were each conceptually different, describing them as Yin and yang respectively. A Super Deluxe edition of The Fame Monster including The Fame and additional merchandise, including a lock of her wig, was released on December 15, 2009.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/TheFameMonsterStandard.jpg/220px-TheFameMonsterStandard.jpg
