2.00	Early_Medieval	Early Middle Ages	The Early Middle Ages was the period of European history lasting from the 5th century to approximately the 11th century. The Early Middle Ages followed the decline of the Western Roman Empire and preceded the High Middle Ages (c. 1001â€“1300). The period saw a continuation of trends begun during late classical antiquity, including population decline, especially in urban centres, a decline of trade, and increased immigration. The period has been labelled the "Dark Ages", a characterization highlighting the relative paucity of literary and cultural output from this time, especially in Western Europe. However, the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire, continued to survive, and in the 7th century the Islamic caliphates conquered swaths of formerly Roman territory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Europe_814.jpg/340px-Europe_814.jpg
