1.00	Sertoli_cell_nodule	Sertoli cell nodule	A Sertoli cell nodule, also Pick's adenoma, testicular tubular adenoma and tubular adenoma of the testis, is a benign proliferation of Sertoli cells that arises in association with cryptorchidism (undescended testis). They are not composed of a clonal cell population, i.e. neoplastic; thus, technically, they should not be called an adenoma.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Sertoli_cell_nodule_high_mag.jpg/230px-Sertoli_cell_nodule_high_mag.jpg
