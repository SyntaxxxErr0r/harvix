55.1	Kebab	Kebab	Kebab ( or kabab, kabob) is a wide variety of meat dishes originating in Persia and later on adopted in the Middle East, Turkey, South Asia and Asia Minor, that are now found worldwide. In North American English, kebab with no qualification generally refers more specifically to shish kebab served on the skewer. In the Middle East, however, kebab includes grilled, roasted, and stewed dishes of large or small cuts of meat, or even ground meat; it may be served on plates, in sandwiches, or in bowls. The traditional meat for kebab is lamb, but depending on local tastes and taboos, it may now be beef, goat, chicken, pork; fish and seafood; or even vegetarian foods like falafel or tofu. Like other ethnic foods brought by travellers, the kebab has become part of everyday cuisine in many countries around the globe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/D%C3%B6ner_kebab.jpg/200px-D%C3%B6ner_kebab.jpg
