2.00	St_John_Street,_London	A1 road (London)	The A1 road in London is an A road in North London. It runs from London Wall to Bignell's Corner, where it crosses the M25 and becomes the A1(M) motorway, alternating with the A1 as it continues to Edinburgh. The London section of the road passes through four London Boroughs: the City of London, Islington, Haringey and Barnet. Whilst the route of the A1 outside London closely follows the historic route of the Great North Road, the London section for the most part does not.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/A1_and_A1000.png/290px-A1_and_A1000.png
