Shamir replaced Shimon Peres of the Alignment as Prime Minister as part of a rotation deal within the national unity coalition between the two parties. The only other change to the coalition was that the one-seat Morasha faction was not included, with the National Religious Party, Agudat Yisrael, Shas, Shinui and Ometz remaining part of the government, although Shinui left on 26 May 1987.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Emblem_of_Israel.svg/100px-Emblem_of_Israel.svg.png
