56.5	Missouri_River	Missouri River	The Missouri River is the longest river in North America and a major waterway of the central United States. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for 2,341 miles (3,767 km) before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km2), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Missouribismarck.jpeg/280px-Missouribismarck.jpeg
