1.10	AL-HASAN	Hasan ibn Ali	Al-Hasan ibn ‘Alī ibn Abī Tālib ‎ ( born March 1, 625 CE (Ramadhān 15th, 3 AH) – died 669CE (Safar 7th or 28th, 50 AH) aged 47) is an important figure in Islam, the son of Fatimah the daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and of the fourth Caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib. Hasan is a member of the Ahl al-Bayt and Ahl al-Kisa. He briefly succeeded his father Ali ibn Abi Talib as the righteous Caliph following the latter's death, before retiring to Madinah and entering into an agreement with the first Umayyad ruler, Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, who assumed the Caliphate. Both Sunni and Shia Muslims regard Hasan as a martyr.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Basmala.svg/170px-Basmala.svg.png
