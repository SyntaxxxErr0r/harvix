55.4	Sodomy	Sodomy	Sodomy refers to anal sex or other non-penile/vaginal copulation-like acts, especially between male persons or between a person and an animal. The word is derived from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in chapters 18 and 19 of the Book of Genesis in the Bible. So-called "sodomy laws" in many countries criminalized not only these behaviors, but other disfavored sexual activities as well, but in the Western world, many of these laws have been overturned, or are not routinely enforced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Sodoma_-_Elluin.jpg/250px-Sodoma_-_Elluin.jpg
