1.00	SOA_Lifecycle	Service-oriented architecture	In software engineering, a Service-Oriented Architecture is a set of principles and methodologies for designing and developing software in the form of interoperable services. These services are well-defined business functionalities that are built as software components (discrete pieces of code and/or data structures) that can be reused for different purposes. SOA design principles are used during the phases of systems development and integration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Soa-layers.svg/220px-Soa-layers.svg.png
