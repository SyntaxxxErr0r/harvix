4.21	Leaf_curl	Leaf curl	Leaf curl is a plant disease caused by a fungus or virus (especially genus Begomovirus of the family Geminiviridae) and characterized by curling of leaves. Although all leaf curl occurring in different plants (usually only citrus plants) is relatively the same, one of the most notable types is peach leaf curl, caused by the fungus Taphrina deformans. Taphrina deformans belongs to the subclass Protoascomycetes. Leaf curl is found in America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. It was first introduced in America in 1852 and has now spread all over the country.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Taphrina_deformans_1.jpg/220px-Taphrina_deformans_1.jpg
