63.0	Crepuscular_rays	Crepuscular rays	Crepuscular rays (also known as God's rays), in atmospheric optics, are rays of sunlight that appear to radiate from a single point in the sky, specifically, where the sun is. These rays, which stream through gaps in clouds (particularly stratocumulus) or between other objects, are columns of sunlit air separated by darker cloud-shadowed regions. The name comes from their frequent occurrences during crepuscular hours (those around dawn and dusk), when the contrasts between light and dark are the most obvious. Crepuscular comes from the Latin word crepusculum meaning twilight.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Crepuscular_rays_at_Sunset_near_Waterberg_Plateau_edit.jpg/220px-Crepuscular_rays_at_Sunset_near_Waterberg_Plateau_edit.jpg
