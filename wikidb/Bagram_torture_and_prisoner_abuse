A concrete-and-sheet metal facility that was retrofitted with wire pens and wooden isolation cells, the center is part of Bagram Air Base in the ancient city of Bagram near Charikar in Parvan, Afghanistan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Bagram_prisoner_abuse.184.1.450.jpg/220px-Bagram_prisoner_abuse.184.1.450.jpg
