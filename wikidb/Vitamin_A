90.1	Vitamin_A	Vitamin A	Vitamin A (or Vitamin A Retinol, retinal, and four carotenoids including beta carotene) is a vitamin that is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of a specific metabolite, the light-absorbing molecule retinal, that is necessary for both low-light (scotopic vision) and color vision. Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol known as retinoic acid, which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/All-trans-Retinol2.svg/177px-All-trans-Retinol2.svg.png
