3.60	Isla_de_Albor%C3%A1n	Isla de Alborán	The Isla de Alborán is a small islet in the Alborán Sea, part of the western Mediterranean, about 50 km north of the Moroccan coast and 90 km south of the province of Almería, Spain. A Spanish possession since 1540, it was taken from the Tunisian pirate Al Borani in the Battle of Alborán. It is home today to a small Spanish Navy garrison and an automated lighthouse. Some 100 m off the northeastern end of the island is the small Isla de las Nubes (literally, island of the clouds).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Alboran.jpg/220px-Alboran.jpg
