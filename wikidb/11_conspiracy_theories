109.4	11_conspiracy_theories	9/11 conspiracy theories	9/11 conspiracy theories are theories that disagree with the widely accepted account that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated solely by al-Qaeda, without any detailed advanced knowledge on the part of any government agency. Proponents of these theories claim there were inconsistencies in the official conclusions or evidence that was overlooked. In a 2008 global poll of 17 countries, 46% of those surveyed believed al-Qaeda was responsible for the attacks, 15% believed the U.S. government was responsible, 7% believed Israel was and another 7% believed some other perpetrator, other than al Qaeda, was responsible. The poll found that respondents in the Middle East were especially likely to name a perpetrator other than al-Qaeda. People who believe in 9/11 conspiracy theories are also more likely to believe other conspiracy theories such as competing theories about the death of Osama bin Laden, with some believing he is still alive.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Wtc_arial_march2001.jpg/220px-Wtc_arial_march2001.jpg
