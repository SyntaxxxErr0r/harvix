102.5	Schengen_Area	Schengen Area	The Schengen Area comprises the territories of twenty-six European countries that have implemented the Schengen Agreement signed in the town of Schengen, Luxembourg, in 1985. The Schengen Area operates very much like a single state for international travel with border controls for those travelling in and out of the area, but with no internal border controls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Schengen_Area.svg/300px-Schengen_Area.svg.png
