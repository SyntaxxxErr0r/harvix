13.30	Hartley_oscillator	Hartley oscillator	A Hartley oscillator is essentially any configuration that uses two series-connected coils and a single capacitor (see Colpitts oscillator for the equivalent oscillator using two capacitors and one coil). Although there is no requirement for there to be mutual coupling between the two coil segments, the circuit is usually implemented this way.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Hartley_osc.svg/236px-Hartley_osc.svg.png
