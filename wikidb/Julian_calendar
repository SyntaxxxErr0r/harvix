168.7	Julian_calendar	Julian calendar	Scaliger's proposal is the most widely accepted solution. It closely matches Macrobius' description and results in a calendar year and leap year cycle which exactly matches the proleptic Julian calendar at the time of Caesar's reform, except for his belief that the first reformed year, 45 BC, was not a leap year. Although some scholars, including Mommsen, support Ideler's view that 45 BC was a leap year, Brind'Amour has proved that there was only one bissextile day before 41 BC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Bogojavlenie.jpg/220px-Bogojavlenie.jpg
