197.4	Streaming_media	Streaming media	Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being delivered by a streaming provider. With streaming, the client browser or plug-in can start displaying the data before the entire file has been transmitted.note 1 The name refers to the delivery method of the medium rather than to the medium itself. The distinction is usually applied to media that are distributed over telecommunications networks, as most other delivery systems are either inherently streaming or inherently nonstreaming (e.g., books, video cassettes, audio CDs). The verb "to stream" is also derived from this term, meaning to deliver media in this manner. Internet television is a commonly streamed medium. Streaming media can be something else other than video and audio. Live closed captioning and stock tickers are considered streaming text, as is Real-Time Text.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Sample_Webcast_Screenshot.png/300px-Sample_Webcast_Screenshot.png
