94.5	Tennessee_Valley_Authority	Tennessee Valley Authority	The Tennessee Valley Authority is a federally owned corporation in the United States created by congressional charter in May 1933 to provide navigation, flood control, electricity generation, fertilizer manufacturing, and economic development in the Tennessee Valley, a region particularly affected by the Great Depression. The enterprise was a result of the efforts of Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska. TVA was envisioned not only as a provider, but also as a regional economic development agency that would use federal experts and electricity to rapidly modernize the region's economy and society.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/US-TennesseeValleyAuthority-Logo.svg/140px-US-TennesseeValleyAuthority-Logo.svg.png
