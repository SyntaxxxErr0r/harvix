79.6	East_Coast_of_the_United_States	East Coast of the United States	The East Coast of the United States, also known as the Eastern Seaboard, refers to the easternmost coastal states in the United States, which touch the Atlantic Ocean and stretch up to Canada. The term includes the U.S. states of (from north to south): Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Although they do not border the Atlantic Ocean itself, Pennsylvania, which borders on the tidal southern reaches of the Delaware river; Connecticut, which borders Long Island Sound, but is bounded to the east at sea by New York and Rhode Island; and Vermont, claimed before statehood by New Hampshire and in 1764 declared by King George III a part of New York state, are normally included in this grouping.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/US_map-East_Coast.svg/300px-US_map-East_Coast.svg.png
