51.0	2010%E2%80%932011_Middle_East_and_North_Africa_protests	Arab Spring	The Arab Spring is a revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests occurring in the Arab world that began on Saturday, 18 December 2010. To date, rulers have been forced from power in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen; civil uprisings have erupted in Bahrain and Syria; major protests have broken out in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, and Oman; and minor protests have occurred in Lebanon, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Western Sahara. Clashes at the borders of Israel in May 2011, as well as protests by the Arab minority in Iranian Khuzestan, have also been inspired by the regional Arab Spring, and a rebellion in Malian Azawad and the country's coup d'Ã©tat have been described as fallout from the Arab Spring.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Info_box_collage_for_mena_Arabic_protests.png/300px-Info_box_collage_for_mena_Arabic_protests.png
