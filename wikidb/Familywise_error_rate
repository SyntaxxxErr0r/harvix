8.22	Familywise_error_rate	Familywise error rate	The m specific hypotheses of interest are assumed to be known, but the number of true null hypotheses m0 and of alternative hypotheses m1, are unknown. V is the number of Type I errors (hypotheses declared significant when they are actually from the null distribution). T is the number of Type II errors (hypotheses declared not significant when they are actually from the alternative distribution). R is an observable random variable, while S, T , U, and V are unobservable random variables.
