75.5	Anglicanism	Anglicanism	Anglicanism is a tradition within Christianity comprising churches with historical connections to the Church of England or similar beliefs, worship and church structures. The word Anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana, a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church. Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans. The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion. There are, however, a number of churches outside of the Anglican Communion which also consider themselves to be Anglican, most notably those referred to as Continuing Anglican churches.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Canterbury_Cathedral_-_Portal_Nave_Cross-spire.jpeg/160px-Canterbury_Cathedral_-_Portal_Nave_Cross-spire.jpeg
