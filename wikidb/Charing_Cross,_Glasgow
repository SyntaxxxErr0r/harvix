3.10	Charing_Cross,_Glasgow	Charing Cross, Glasgow	Charing Cross is a major road junction in the Scottish city of Glasgow. It is situated north of the River Clyde at the intersection of Sauchiehall Street, St George's Road, Woodlands Road, North Street and Newton Street, as well as being at a major interchange of the M8 motorway. Formerly the gateway from the shopping area of Sauchiehall Street to the more prosperous Woodlands area, its architectural qualities were largely razed by the building of the motorway. It still marks the boundary between the City Centre and the West End of the City. Nearby landmarks include the Mitchell Library, the biggest reference library in Western Europe. Charing Cross was also part of the so-called Square Mile of Murder, the location of a series of sensational murders which scandalised Victorian society.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Charing_Cross%2C_Glasgow_in_1966.jpg/220px-Charing_Cross%2C_Glasgow_in_1966.jpg
