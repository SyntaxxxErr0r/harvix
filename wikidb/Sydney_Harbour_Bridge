75.5	Sydney_Harbour_Bridge	Sydney Harbour Bridge	The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch bridge across Sydney Harbour that carries rail, vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic between the Sydney central business district (CBD) and the North Shore. The dramatic view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is an iconic image of both Sydney and Australia. The bridge is nicknamed "The Coathanger" because of its arch-based design.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_from_Circular_Quay.jpg/250px-Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_from_Circular_Quay.jpg
