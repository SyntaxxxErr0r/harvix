85.8	Constitution	Constitution	A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed. These rules together make up, i.e. constitute, what the entity is. When these principles are written down into a single collection or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to comprise a written constitution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Hammurabi.jpg/170px-Hammurabi.jpg
