18.46	Recollection	Recall (memory)	Recall in memory refers to the retrieval of events or information from the past. Along with encoding and storage, it is one of the three core processes of memory. There are three main types of recall: free recall, cued recall and serial recall. Psychologists test these forms of recall as a way to study the memory processes of humans and animals. Two main theories of the process of recall are the Two-Stage Theory and the theory of Encoding Specificity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Ebbinghaus2.jpg/220px-Ebbinghaus2.jpg
