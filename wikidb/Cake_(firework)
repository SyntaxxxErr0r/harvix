2.01	Cake_(firework)	Cake (firework)	A cake firework, also known as a multiple tube device is a firework comprising a series of roman candles, small aerial shells, or a combination of both, connected together by a high-speed fuse. Typically, the internal fusing is set to fire each tube in series, or to fire several tubes at the same time, or a combination of these. Typically a cake will resemble from the outside a simple cube or other rectangular covered shape; after firing, a large number of cardboard tubes (the candles) will be visible in the top of the firework (the paper cover having been blown off by the discharging stars). In a traditional cake, all the candles point upwards; a variant is called the fan or angle cake.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Firework_fan_cake_100_shots.jpg/220px-Firework_fan_cake_100_shots.jpg
