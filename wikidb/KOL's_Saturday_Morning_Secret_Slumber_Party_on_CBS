1.00	KOL's_Saturday_Morning_Secret_Slumber_Party_on_CBS	Camp Lazlo	Camp Lazlo is an American animated television series created by Joe Murray. The show featured a Boy Scout-like summer camp with a cast of anthropomorphic animal characters, a "retro" type of humor and silliness akin to Murray's previous series, Rocko's Modern Life (which aired on Nickelodeon a decade earlier), and cultural references.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/Camp_Lazlo.jpg/250px-Camp_Lazlo.jpg
