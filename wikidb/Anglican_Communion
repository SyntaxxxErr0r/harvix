58.0	Anglican_Communion	Anglican Communion	The Anglican Communion is an international association of national and regional Anglican churches (and a few other episcopal churches) in full communion with the Church of England (which is regarded as the mother church of the worldwide communion) and specifically with its principal primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury. There is no single "Anglican Church" with universal juridical authority as each national or regional church has full autonomy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Canterbury_Cathedral_-_Portal_Nave_Cross-spire.jpeg/160px-Canterbury_Cathedral_-_Portal_Nave_Cross-spire.jpeg
