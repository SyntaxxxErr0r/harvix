7.60	Trent_affair	Trent Affair	The Trent Affair, also known as the Mason and Slidell Affair, was an international diplomatic incident that occurred during the American Civil War. On November 8, 1861, the USS San Jacinto, commanded by Union Captain Charles Wilkes, intercepted the British mail packet RMS Trent and removed, as contraband of war, two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell. The envoys were bound for Great Britain and France to press the Confederacyâ€™s case for diplomatic recognition by Europe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/JamesMurrayMasonPortrait.jpg/170px-JamesMurrayMasonPortrait.jpg
