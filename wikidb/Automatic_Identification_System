64.6	Automatic_Identification_System	Automatic Identification System	Information provided by AIS equipment, such as unique identification, position, course, and speed, can be displayed on a screen or an ECDIS. AIS is intended to assist a vessel's watchstanding officers and allow maritime authorities to track and monitor vessel movements. AIS integrates a standardized VHF transceiver with a positioning system such as a LORAN-C or GPS receiver, with other electronic navigation sensors, such as a gyrocompass or rate of turn indicator. Ships outside AIS radio range can be tracked with the Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system with less frequent transmission.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/OperationsSpecialistVTS.jpg/220px-OperationsSpecialistVTS.jpg
