1.12	Death_by_elephant	Execution by elephant	Execution by elephant was a common method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, and particularly in India. Asian Elephants were used to crush, dismember, or torture captives in public executions. The animals were trained and versatile, both able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power and his ability to control wild animals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Crushed_by_elephant.png/220px-Crushed_by_elephant.png
