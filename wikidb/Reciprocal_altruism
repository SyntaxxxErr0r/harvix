66.7	Reciprocal_altruism	Reciprocal altruism	In evolutionary biology, reciprocal altruism is a behaviour whereby an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other organism will act in a similar manner at a later time. The concept was initially developed by Robert Trivers to explain the evolution of cooperation as instances of mutually altruistic acts. The concept is close to the strategy of "tit for tat" used in game theory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Reciprocal_altruism.jpg/240px-Reciprocal_altruism.jpg
