54.7	Nomad	Nomad	Nomadic people all over the world (Greek: , nom√°des, "those who let pasture herds"), commonly known as itinerants in modern-day contexts, are communities of people who move from one place to another, rather than settling permanently in one location. There are an estimated 30-40 million nomads in the world. Many cultures have traditionally been nomadic, but traditional nomadic behavior is increasingly rare in industrialized countries. Nomadic cultures are discussed in three categories according to economic specialization: hunter-gatherers, pastoral nomads, and "peripatetic nomads".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Nomads_near_Namtso.jpg/250px-Nomads_near_Namtso.jpg
