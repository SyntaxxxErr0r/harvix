2.00	Esclusham	Esclusham	The name is recorded as Esclesham or Esclusham as early as 1315, likely originating in a combination of the Old English personal name Ã†scel with ham, "settlement"; the name is locally pronounced with stress on the second (middle) syllable, probably due to the influence of Welsh language stress patterns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/SPIMG0021a.jpg/200px-SPIMG0021a.jpg
