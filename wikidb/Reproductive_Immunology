The placenta also plays an important part in protecting the embryo for the immune attack from the mother's system. Studies also propose that proteins in semen may help woman’s immune system prepare for conception and pregnancy. For example, there is substantial evidence for exposure to partner's semen as prevention for pre-eclampsia, largely due to the absorption of several immune modulating factors present in seminal fluid, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ).
