238.6	IPv4	IPv4	RFC 5735 defines the special address block 169.254.0.0/16 for link-local addressing. These addresses are only valid on links (such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection) connected to a host. These addresses are not routable. Like private addresses, these addresses cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the internet. These addresses are primarily used for address autoconfiguration when a host cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server or other internal configuration methods.
