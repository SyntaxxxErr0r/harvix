In 1999 Time named Pankhurst as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, stating: "she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back." She was widely criticized for her militant tactics, and historians disagree about their effectiveness, but her work is recognized as a crucial element in achieving women's suffrage in Britain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Emmeline_Pankhurst2.jpg/220px-Emmeline_Pankhurst2.jpg
