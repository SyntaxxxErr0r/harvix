13.70	WKBW-TV	WKBW-TV	WKBW-TV, channel 7, is the ABC affiliate for the Buffalo, New York television market, and is one of many local Buffalo TV stations seen over-the-air and on cable in Canada. Its transmitter is located at 8909 Center Street in Colden. The station is owned by the Granite Broadcasting Corporation, who previously operated WNGS under a local marketing agreement (LMA). For many years, it was carried via microwave to cable systems in such areas as Corning and Horseheads for ABC service; this ended when WENY-TV signed on.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Logo_channel7.jpg
