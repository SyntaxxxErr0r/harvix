At its peak, Viroconium is estimated to have been the fourth largest Roman settlement in Britain, a civitas capital with a population of more than 15,000 people. The settlement probably lasted until the beginning of the eighth century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Excavation_at_Uriconium_by_Francis_Bedford2.jpg/300px-Excavation_at_Uriconium_by_Francis_Bedford2.jpg
