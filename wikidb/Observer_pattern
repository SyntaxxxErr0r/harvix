105.3	Observer_pattern	Observer pattern	The observer pattern (aka. Dependents, publish/subscribe) is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems. Observer is also a key part in the familiar MVC architectural pattern. In fact the observer pattern was first implemented in Smalltalk's MVC based user interface framework.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Observer.svg/500px-Observer.svg.png
