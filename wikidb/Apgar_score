69.4	Apgar_score	Apgar score	The Apgar score was devised in 1952 by the eponymous Dr. Virginia Apgar as a simple and repeatable method to quickly and summarily assess the health of newborn children immediately after birth. Apgar was an anesthesiologist who developed the score in order to ascertain the effects of obstetric anesthesia on babies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Virginia_Apgar.jpg/220px-Virginia_Apgar.jpg
