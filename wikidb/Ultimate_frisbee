52.1	Ultimate_frisbee	Ultimate (sport)	Ultimate is a sport played with a flying disc. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to a player in the opposing end zone, similar to an end zone in American football or rugby. Players may not run with the disc, and may only move one foot (pivot) while holding the disc. Because it has only become popular recently -- and because it is self-refereed at even the highest levels -- there is still a wide debate over its status as a sport.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Ultimate_at_UNC-Wilmington.jpg/200px-Ultimate_at_UNC-Wilmington.jpg
