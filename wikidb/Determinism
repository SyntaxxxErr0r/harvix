104.9	Determinism	Determinism	Determinism is a philosophy stating that for everything that happens there are conditions such that, given them, nothing else could happen. Different versions of this theory depend upon various alleged connections, and interdependencies of things and events, asserting that these hold without exception. Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse motives and considerations, some of which overlap considerably. They can be understood in relation to their historical significance and alternative theories. Some forms of determinism can be tested empirically with ideas stemming from physics and the philosophy of physics. The opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called Nondeterminism). Determinism is often contrasted with free will.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Willow_path.jpg/140px-Willow_path.jpg
