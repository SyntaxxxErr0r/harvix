Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Private_Equity_Fund_Diagram.png/350px-Private_Equity_Fund_Diagram.png
