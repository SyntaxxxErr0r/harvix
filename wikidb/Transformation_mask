These masks usually depict an outer, animal visage, which the performer can open by pulling a string to reveal an inner, human face carved in wood. Northwest coast peoples generally use them in potlatches to illustrate myths, while they are used by Alaska natives for shamanic rituals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Whale_Transformation_Mask.jpg/220px-Whale_Transformation_Mask.jpg
