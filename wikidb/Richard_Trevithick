51.6	Richard_Trevithick	Richard Trevithick	Richard Trevithick (13 April 1771 â€“ 22 April 1833) was a British inventor and mining engineer from Cornwall. Born in the mining heartland of Cornwall, Trevithick was immersed in mining and engineering from a young age. The son of a mining captain, he performed poorly in school, but went on to be an early pioneer in steam-powered rail. His most significant contribution was to the development of the first high pressure steam engine, he also built the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive. On 21 February 1804 the world's first locomotive-hauled railway journey took place as Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the Penydarren Ironworks, in Merthyr Tydfil in Wales.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Trevithick_Richard_Linnell.jpg/180px-Trevithick_Richard_Linnell.jpg
