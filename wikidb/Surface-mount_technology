87.1	Surface-mount_technology	Surface-mount technology	Surface-mount technology is a method for constructing electronic circuits in which the components are mounted directly onto the surface of printed circuit boards (PCBs). An electronic device so made is called a surface-mount device (SMD). In the industry it has largely replaced the through-hole technology construction method of fitting components with wire leads into holes in the circuit board.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Smt_closeup.jpg/220px-Smt_closeup.jpg
