6.20	Wahkeenah_Falls	Wahkeena Falls	Wahkeena Falls is the name of a 242 foot (73 m) waterfall in the Columbia River Gorge in the state of Oregon. Spellings of this word are dubious, because the word is merely an English transliteration of a Pacific Northwest Native American (reportedly Yakama) phrase meaning "most beautiful".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Wahkeenah-wiki.JPG
