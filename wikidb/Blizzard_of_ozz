1.00	Blizzard_of_ozz	Blizzard of Ozz	Blizzard of Ozz is the first solo studio album by British singer/songwriter Ozzy Osbourne, recorded in Surrey, UK and released on September 20, 1980 in the UK and on March 27, 1981 in the US. It postdates Osbourne's departure from Black Sabbath in 1979, also his comeback, and marks Ozzy's second effort to begin a solo career (his first being in 1978 with members of Necromandus using the name 'Blizzard of Ozz' ). Blizzard of Ozz is the first of two studio albums Ozzy recorded with legendary guitarist Randy Rhoads prior to Rhoads' unfortunate death in 1982. Blizzard of Ozz was a commercial success and was certified 4x Platinum in the U.S., (a feat Osbourne would again achieve with the release of No More Tears). The album has sold over 6,000,000 copies worldwide, making it Ozzy's best-selling album to date. In the UK, it was the first of four Osbourne albums to attain Silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in August 1981. It also ranked 13th on a Guitar World readers poll.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/Blizzard_of_ozz.jpg/220px-Blizzard_of_ozz.jpg
