Although these practices are considered alternative medicine in the Western world, they are a common part of medical care throughout East Asia, accounting for estimated 40% of all health care delivered in China.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/ChineseMedicine-HK.JPG/200px-ChineseMedicine-HK.JPG
