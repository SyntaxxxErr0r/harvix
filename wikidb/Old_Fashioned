69.3	Old_Fashioned	Old Fashioned	The Old Fashioned is a type of cocktail made by muddling dissolved sugar with bitters then adding alcohol, such as whiskey or brandy, and a twist of citrus rind. It is traditionally served in a short, round, 8–12 US fl oz (240–350 ml) tumbler-like glass, which is called an Old Fashioned glass, named after the drink.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Oldfashioned-cocktail.png/220px-Oldfashioned-cocktail.png
