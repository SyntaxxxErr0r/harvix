51.6	Urethra	Urethra	In anatomy, the urethra (from Greek οὐρήθρα - ourethra) is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the genitals for the removal of fluids out of the body. In males, the urethra travels through the penis, and carries semen as well as urine. In females, the urethra is shorter and emerges above the vaginal opening.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Urethral_urothelial_cell_carcinoma.jpg/220px-Urethral_urothelial_cell_carcinoma.jpg
