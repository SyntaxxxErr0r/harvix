54.88	Same-sex_marriage_in_New_York	Same-sex marriage in New York	Same-sex marriage in the U.S. state of New York became legal on July 24, 2011, under the Marriage Equality Act, which was passed by the New York State Legislature on June 24, 2011 and signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo on the same day. The Marriage Equality Act does not have a residency restriction, as some other states do, and allows religious organizations to decline to officiate same-sex wedding ceremonies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Jason_West_20050612_gayrally.jpg/220px-Jason_West_20050612_gayrally.jpg
