265.3	Dark_matter	Dark matter	In astronomy and cosmology, dark matter is a currently unknown type of matter hypothesized to account for a large part of the total mass in the universe. Dark matter neither emits nor absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation, and so cannot be directly seen with telescopes. Dark matter is estimated to constitute 83% of the matter in the universe and 23% of the mass-energy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/WMAP_2010.png/220px-WMAP_2010.png
