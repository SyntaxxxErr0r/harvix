2.12	The_Four_Apostles	The Four Apostles	The Four Apostles is a panel painting by the German Renaissance master Albrecht DÃ¼rer. It was finished in 1526, the last of his large works. It depicts the four apostles larger-than-life-size. The Bavarian Elector Maximilian I obtained The Four Apostles in the year 1627 due to pressure on the Nuremberg city fathers. Since then, the painting has been in Munich and, despite all the efforts of Nuremberg since 1806, it has not been returned.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_026.jpg/130px-Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer_026.jpg
