4.00	Super_star_wars	Super Star Wars	Super Star Wars is a 1992 platform game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System based on the 1977 film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The game was later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console. The term Super Star Wars can refer to the first game or to all three games collectively. All three are essentially platform games, although they all have stages which feature other challenges, such as driving a landspeeder or piloting an X-wing. The game was followed by two sequels which also feature multiple playable characters with different abilities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Super_Star_Wars_box_art.jpg/250px-Super_Star_Wars_box_art.jpg
