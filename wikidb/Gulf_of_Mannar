It lies between the southeastern tip of India and the west coast of Sri Lanka. A chain of low islands and reefs known as Adam's Bridge, also called Ramsethu, which includes Mannar Island, separates the Gulf of Mannar from Palk Bay, which lies to the north between India and Sri Lanka. The Thamirabarani River of south India and the Aruvi Aru of Sri Lanka drain into the Gulf.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Locatie_Golf_van_Mannar.PNG/240px-Locatie_Golf_van_Mannar.PNG
