3.00	Baba_O'Reilly	Baba O'Riley	"Baba O'Riley" is a song written by Pete Townshend for the English rock band The Who. Roger Daltrey sings most of the song, with Pete Townshend singing the middle eight: "Don't cry/don't raise your eye/it's only teenage wasteland". The title of the song is derived from the combination of the song's philosophical and musical influences, Meher Baba and Terry Riley.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/The_Who_-_Baba_cover.jpg/220px-The_Who_-_Baba_cover.jpg
