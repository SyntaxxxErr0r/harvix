86.2	Insolation	Insolation	Insolation is a measure of solar radiation energy received on a given surface area and recorded during a given time. It is also called solar irradiation and expressed as hourly irradiation if recorded during an hour, daily irradiation if recorded during a day, for example. The unit recommended by the World Meteorological Organization is MJ/m2 (megajoules per square meter) or J/cm2 (joules per square centimeter). Practitioners in the business of solar energy may use the unit Wh/m2 (watt-hours per square meter). If this energy is divided by the recording time in hours, it is then a density of power called irradiance, expressed in W/m2 (watts per square meter).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Insolation.png/300px-Insolation.png
