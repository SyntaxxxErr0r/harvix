19.38	Zdzis%C5%82aw_Beksi%C5%84ski	Zdzisław Beksiński	Zdzisław Beksiński (Polish pronunciation: ; 24 February 1929 – 21 February 2005) was a renowned Polish painter, photographer, and sculptor who is best known as a fantasy artist. Beksiński executed his paintings and drawings either in what he called a 'Baroque' or a 'Gothic' manner. The first style is dominated by representation, with the best-known examples coming from his 'fantastic realism' period when he painted disturbing images of a surrealistic, nightmarish environment. The second style is more abstract, being dominated by form, and is typified by Beksiński's later paintings. Beksiński was murdered in 2005.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Zdzislaw_Beksinski_in_Sanok-crop.jpg/220px-Zdzislaw_Beksinski_in_Sanok-crop.jpg
