Its summit is 4,478 metres (14,690 ft) high, making it one of the highest peaks in the Alps. The four steep faces, rising above the surrounding glaciers, face the four compass points. The mountain overlooks the town of Zermatt in the canton of Valais to the north-east and Breuil-Cervinia in the Aosta Valley to the south. The Theodul Pass, located at the eastern base of the peak, is the lowest passage between its north and south side.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Matterhorn_from_Domh%C3%BCtte_-_2.jpg/280px-Matterhorn_from_Domh%C3%BCtte_-_2.jpg
