Though painless, this generally results in the animal collapsing on its side. The characteristic is caused by a hereditary genetic disorder called myotonia congenita. When startled, younger goats will stiffen and fall over. Older goats learn to spread their legs or lean against something when startled, and often they continue to run about in an awkward, stiff-legged shuffle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Fainted.jpg/250px-Fainted.jpg
