54.3	Mesolithic	Mesolithic	The Mesolithic (Greek: mesos "middle", lithos "stone") is an archaeological concept used to refer to specific groups of archaeological cultures defined as falling between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. The term developed as a catch-all to refer to material that did not fit into the other categories of prehistory and after the development of radiocarbon dating the arbitrary nature of its definition has become apparent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/OpgravingStevoort.jpg/225px-OpgravingStevoort.jpg
