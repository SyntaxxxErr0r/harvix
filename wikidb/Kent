119.1	Kent	Kent	Kent is a county in South East England, and one of the home counties. It borders East Sussex, Surrey and Greater London and has a defined boundary with Essex in the middle of the Thames Estuary. The ceremonial county boundaries of Kent include the shire county of Kent and the unitary borough of Medway. Kent has a nominal border with France halfway through the Channel Tunnel. Maidstone is its county town and historically Rochester and Canterbury have been accorded city status, though only the latter still holds it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Flag_of_Kent.svg/220px-Flag_of_Kent.svg.png
