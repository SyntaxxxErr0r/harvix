93.4	Myopia	Myopia	Myopia , "shortsightedness" (BrE)) is a condition of the eye where the light that comes in does not directly focus on the retina but in front of it. This causes the image that one sees when looking at a distant object to be out of focus but in focus when looking at a close object.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Myopia.gif/230px-Myopia.gif
