58.8	Pisco_Sour	Pisco Sour	A Pisco Sour is a cocktail typical of western South American cuisine. The drink's name is a mixture of the Quechua word Pisco (English: ) and the term Sour (in reference to the mixed drink family of the same name). The Peruvian Pisco Sour requires the use of Peruvian Pisco as the base liquor and the addition of lime (or lemon) juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean Pisco, sugar instead of syrup, and excludes the bitter. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Pisco_sour_20100613b.JPG/220px-Pisco_sour_20100613b.JPG
