10.60	Simon_Stock	Simon Stock	Saint Simon Stock, an Englishman who lived in the 13th century, was an early prior general of the Carmelite religious order. Little is known about his life with any historical certainty. The Blessed Virgin Mary is traditionally said to have appeared to him and given him the Carmelite habit, the Brown Scapular, with a promise that those who die wearing it will be saved. Thus, popular devotion to Saint Simon Stock is usually associated with devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Pietro_Novelli_Our_Lady_of_Carmel_and_Saints.JPG/250px-Pietro_Novelli_Our_Lady_of_Carmel_and_Saints.JPG
