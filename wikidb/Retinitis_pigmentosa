59.9	Retinitis_pigmentosa	Retinitis pigmentosa	Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of genetic eye conditions that leads to incurable blindness. In the progression of symptoms for RP, night blindness generally precedes tunnel vision by years or even decades. Many people with RP do not become legally blind until their 40s or 50s and retain some sight all their lives. Others go completely blind from RP, in some cases as early as childhood. Progression of RP is different in each case.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Fundus_of_patient_with_retinitis_pigmentosa%2C_mid_stage.jpg/230px-Fundus_of_patient_with_retinitis_pigmentosa%2C_mid_stage.jpg
