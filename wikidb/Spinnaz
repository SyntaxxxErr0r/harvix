2.00	Spinnaz	Spinner (wheel)	A spinner is a type of hubcap that spins independently inside of a wheel itself when the vehicle is in motion, and continues to spin once the vehicle has come to a stop. Being an attachment to the car's wheel, spinners operate by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel, allowing it to turn while the wheel is at rest. The spinner's own momentum helps it overcome what little friction is transmitted through the bearing. When the car is in motion, the small amount of friction transmitted through the bearing sets the spinner in motion. Spinners were popular within the hip-hop community of the United States and are gradually fading out of vogue in popular culture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Spinner_rim.jpg/220px-Spinner_rim.jpg
