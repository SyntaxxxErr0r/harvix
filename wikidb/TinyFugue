2.10	TinyFugue	TinyFugue	TinyFugue, or tf, is a MUD client, primarily written for Unix-like operating systems. It is one of the earliest MUD clients in existence. It is a successor to the earliest MUD client, TinyTalk, through a never-officially-released improved version called TinyWar. It has been maintained by Ken Keys since the early days and he continues to work on it to this day. Like the name suggests, it is primarily geared toward TinyMUD variants, but can easily be used or adapted for most other MUD types.
