161.0	Hajj	Hajj	The Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is one of the largest pilgrimages in the world, and is the fifth pillar of Islam, a religious duty that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford to do so. The Hajj is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people, and their submission to God (Allah in the Arabic language).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Al-Haram_mosque_-_Flickr_-_Al_Jazeera_English.jpg/220px-Al-Haram_mosque_-_Flickr_-_Al_Jazeera_English.jpg
