Ford Presidential Museum is part of the Presidential Libraries System of the National Archives and Records Administration, a federal agency. Unlike most other presidential libraries and museums, Ford's are two geographically separate buildings. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Presidential Museum are located approximately 130 miles (210 km) apart. The Presidential Library is located at 1000 Beal Avenue on the north campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where Ford was a student and football player. The Presidential Museum however, is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan at 303 Pearl Street NW (at Scribner Street), near Grand Valley State University's Pew Campus in Grand Rapids, on the banks of the Grand River. Despite the physical separation, the library and museum are a single institution with one director.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Ford_ford_museum.jpg/260px-Ford_ford_museum.jpg
