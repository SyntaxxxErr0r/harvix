54.6	Egg_white	Egg white	Egg white is the common name for the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. In chickens it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen's oviduct during the passage of the egg. It forms around either fertilized or unfertilized egg yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for the growth of the embryo (when fertilized).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Chicken_egg01_monovular.jpg/220px-Chicken_egg01_monovular.jpg
