58.1	Client-server	Clientâ€“server model	The client/server model is a computing model that acts as distributed application which partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server machine is a host that is running one or more server programs which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or service function. Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Client-server-model.svg/220px-Client-server-model.svg.png
