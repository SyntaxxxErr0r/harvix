1.40	Blake_Fell	Blake Fell	Blake Fell is a hill in the Western part of the English Lake District. It is the highest point of the Loweswater Fells, an area of low grassy hills with steep sides overlooking the lake of Loweswater. The fell also overlooks the village of Loweswater, from which it can be climbed. An alternative route is from the Cogra Moss reservoir on its western slopes. Because the Loweswater Fells are a separate geographical unit, Blake Fell is a Marilyn. It is located in the Parish of Lamplugh.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Blake_Fell.jpg/280px-Blake_Fell.jpg
