The following year, The Carpenters covered the song, using a crew of 160 musicians. Both versions of the single had the entire name of the song on the label (the picture sleeve of the Carpenters' single had the subtitle in small print); reissued singles of the Klaatu version had the title shortened to "Calling Occupants."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Carpenters_Calling_Occupants.jpg
