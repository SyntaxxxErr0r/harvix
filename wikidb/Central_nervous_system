168.8	Central_nervous_system	Central nervous system	During early development of the vertebrate embryo, a longitudinal groove on the neural plate gradually deepens as ridges on either side of the groove (the neural folds) become elevated, and ultimately meet, transforming the groove into a closed tube, the ectodermal wall of which forms the rudiment of the nervous system. This tube initially differentiates into three vesicles (pockets): the prosencephalon at the front, the mesencephalon, and, between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the rhombencephalon. (By six weeks in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the telencephalon and diencephalon; and the rhombencephalon divides into the metencephalon and myelencephalon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Development_of_the_neural_tube.png/220px-Development_of_the_neural_tube.png
