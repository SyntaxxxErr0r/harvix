1.00	2012_Mali_coup_d'%C3%A9tat_attempt	2012 Malian coup d'état	The 2012 Malian coup d'état began on 21 March, when renegade Malian soldiers attacked several locations in the capital Bamako, including the presidential palace, state television, and military barracks. The soldiers, who said they had formed the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State, declared the following day that they had overthrown the government of Amadou Toumani Touré, forcing him into hiding. The coup was followed by "unanimous" international condemnation and swift gains by Tuareg forces in the country's north. On 1 April, the CNRDR announced its reinstatement of the constitution and its intention to hold elections in which it would not participate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Azawad_Tuareg_rebellion_2012.svg/300px-Azawad_Tuareg_rebellion_2012.svg.png
