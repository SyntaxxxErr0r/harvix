6.10	Seattle_General_Strike_of_1919	Seattle General Strike	A few weeks after the November 1918 armistice ended World War I, unions in Seattle's shipbuilding industry demanded a pay increase for unskilled workers. In an attempt to divide the ranks of the union, the yard owners responded by offering a pay increase only to skilled workers. The union rejected that offer and Seattle's 35,000 shipyard workers went on strike on January 21, 1919.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Seattle_General_Strike.jpg/220px-Seattle_General_Strike.jpg
