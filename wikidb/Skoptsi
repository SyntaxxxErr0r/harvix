3.10	Skoptsi	Skoptsy	The Skoptsy (Russian: , also transliterated as Skoptzy, Skoptzi, Skoptsi, Skopzi, Scoptsy, Skapetz and other spellings) were a secret sect in imperial Russia. The Skoptsy are best known for practicing castration of men and the mastectomy of women in accordance with their teachings against sexual lust. The movement originated as an offshoot of the sect known as the "People of God" and was first noted in the late 18th century. The Skoptsy were persecuted by the imperial government and later by the Soviet Union, but enjoyed substantial growth before fading into obscurity by the mid-20th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Skoptsy-woman.JPG/150px-Skoptsy-woman.JPG
