206.7	Monomyth	Monomyth	Joseph Campbell's monomyth, or the hero's journey, is a basic pattern that its proponents argue is found in many narratives from around the world. This widely distributed pattern was described by Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949). An enthusiast of novelist James Joyce, Campbell borrowed the term monomyth from Joyce's Finnegans Wake.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Heroesjourney.svg/220px-Heroesjourney.svg.png
