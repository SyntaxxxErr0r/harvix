78.6	Wesley_Willis	Wesley Willis	Wesley Willis (May 31, 1963 â€“ August 21, 2003) was a musician and artist from Chicago. A diagnosed chronic schizophrenic, he gained an enormous cult following in the 1990s after releasing several hundred songs of simple but unique music, with emphasis on his humorous, bizarre, and frequently obscene lyrics. In addition to his large body of solo musical work, Willis fronted the punk rock band the Wesley Willis Fiasco. He was also a visual artist long before his forays into music, and produced hundreds of intricate, unusual, colored ink-pen drawings, most of them of Chicago streetscapes and CTA buses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Wesley_Willis.jpg/220px-Wesley_Willis.jpg
