6.31	She-crab_soup	She-crab soup	She-crab soup is a rich soup, similar to bisque, made of milk or heavy cream, crab or fish stock, Atlantic blue crab meat, and (traditionally) crab roe, and a small amount of dry sherry added as it is plated. It may be thickened either by heat reduction or with a pur√©e of boiled rice; it may also include such seasonings as mace and shallots or onions. The soup is a regional specialty from the South Carolina Lowcountry and Georgia coast. It is commonly featured on the menus of many Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia restaurants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/She-Crab_Soup.jpg/220px-She-Crab_Soup.jpg
