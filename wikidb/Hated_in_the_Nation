3.00	Hated_in_the_Nation	Hated in the Nation	Hated in the Nation is a compilation album, initially released exclusively on cassette format on ROIR, by transgressive punk rock musician GG Allin. Consisting mainly of then-out-of-print recordings by Allin with his early-era backing groups The Jabbers, The Scumfucs, and the Cedar Street Sluts, Hated in the Nation became Allin's first widespread international release. Since it is a compilation intended to both document Allin's early recording career up to that time and to attract new fans to his music, it is the only GG Allin title that has never gone out-of-print; according to his official website, it is also one of the most popular items in GG's discography.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/GGAllin_HITN.jpg
