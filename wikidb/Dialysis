55.1	Dialysis	Dialysis	In medicine, dialysis (from Greek dialusis, meaning dissolution, dia, meaning through, and lysis, meaning loosening or splitting) is a process for removing waste and excess water from the blood, and is used primarily to provide an artificial replacement for lost kidney function in people with renal failure. Dialysis may be used for those with an acute disturbance in kidney function (acute kidney injury, previously acute renal failure), or progressive but chronically worsening kidney functionâ€“a state known as chronic kidney disease stage 5 (previously chronic renal failure or end-stage kidney disease). The latter form may develop over months or years, but in contrast to acute kidney injury is not usually reversible, and dialysis is regarded as a "holding measure" until a renal transplant can be performed, or sometimes as the only supportive measure in those for whom a transplant would be inappropriate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Patient_receiving_dialysis_02.jpg/230px-Patient_receiving_dialysis_02.jpg
