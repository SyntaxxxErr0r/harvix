55.1	Akkadian_language	Akkadian language	Akkadian is an extinct Semitic language (part of the greater Afroasiatic language family) that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia. The earliest attested Semitic language, it used the cuneiform writing system, which was originally used to write ancient Sumerian, an unrelated language isolate. The name of the language is derived from the city of Akkad, a major center of Semitic Mesopotamian civilization, during the Akkadian Empire (2334 - 2154 BC), although the language predates the founding of Akkad.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/AkkadischLand.png/200px-AkkadischLand.png
