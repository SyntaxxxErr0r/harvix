51.1	Digital_subscriber_line	Digital subscriber line	Digital subscriber line is a family of technologies that provide internet access by transmitting digital data over the wires of a local telephone network. In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), the most commonly installed DSL technology. DSL service is delivered simultaneously with wired telephone service on the same telephone line. This is possible because DSL uses higher frequency bands for data separated by filtering. On the customer premises, a DSL filter on each outlet removes the high frequency interference, to enable simultaneous use of the telephone and data.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/T-DSL_Modem.jpg/220px-T-DSL_Modem.jpg
