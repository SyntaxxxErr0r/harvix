1.20	Troutbeck_Tongue	Troutbeck Tongue	Troutbeck Tongue is a small fell located in the English Lake District, three miles (five kilometres) east of Ambleside. It is one of 214 hills listed in Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells, which makes it a popular attraction for walkers who are aiming to complete all the "Wainwrights". Because of it is moderate height and proximity to a main road it is a pleasant half-day excursion that can be done when the higher fells are in cloud.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Troutbeck_Tongue_from_Troutbeck.jpg/280px-Troutbeck_Tongue_from_Troutbeck.jpg
