1.00	Interval_strength	Interval (music)	In music theory, an interval is a combination of two notes, or the ratio between their frequencies. Two-note combinations are also called dyads. Although chords are often defined as sets of three or more notes, intervals are sometimes considered to be the simplest kind of chord.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Melodic_and_harmonic_intervals.png/275px-Melodic_and_harmonic_intervals.png
