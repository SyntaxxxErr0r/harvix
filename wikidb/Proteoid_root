2.01	Proteoid_root	Cluster root	Proteoid roots, also known as cluster roots, are plant roots that form clusters of closely spaced short lateral rootlets. They may form a two to five centimetre thick mat just beneath the leaf litter. They enhance nutrient uptake, possibly by chemically modifying the soil environment to improve nutrient solubilisation. As a result, plants with proteoid roots can grow in soil that is very low in nutrients, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Leucospermum_cordifolium_proteoid_roots_290805.jpg/220px-Leucospermum_cordifolium_proteoid_roots_290805.jpg
