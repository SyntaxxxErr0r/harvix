3.11	Peter-No-Tail_(film)	Peter-No-Tail (film)	Peter-No-Tail (Swedish: ) is a 1981 Swedish film about a cat who does not have a tail. He is born on a farm in the Swedish countryside, but the farm's owner is greedy and believes that more cats will cost too much money. He orders one of the workers to have Peter drowned, but the worker can't bring himself to do it. He puts Peter in the car of a family who rents a house close to the farm on the summer vacation. He is taken care of by the family, who is living in Uppsala. Without a tail, he becomes the talk of the town among the other cats, and especially Måns, who teases him cruelly. Måns' rough and silly courting of Molly Silk-Nose does not impress her, since she becomes interested in the kind and gentle Peter. But Måns won't give up that easy...	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Peter-No-Tail_%28film%29.jpg/220px-Peter-No-Tail_%28film%29.jpg
