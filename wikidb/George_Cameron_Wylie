2.00	George_Cameron_Wylie	George Wyllie (GC)	Sapper George Cameron Wyllie GC (25 December 1908 â€“ 1 February 1987) of the Royal Engineers was awarded the George Cross for the heroism he displayed on 12 September 1940 when a 2,000 kilograms (4,410 lb) bomb fell near St Paul's Cathedral in Deans Yard. It took three days to dig the bomb out of soft soil, work made even more dangerous by a fire at a fractured gas main. Wylie and his team placed the recovered bomb on a lorry, which was driven to Hackney Marshes, where the bomb was detonated, leaving a crater 100 feet (30 m) wide.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/George_Cross.jpg/120px-George_Cross.jpg
