73.1	Mellotron	Mellotron	The Mellotron is an electro-mechanical, polyphonic tape replay keyboard originally developed and built in Birmingham, England in the early 1960s. It superseded the Chamberlin, which was the world's first sample-playback keyboard intended for music. The concept of the Chamberlin was itself modeled after the Laff Box invented by engineer Charlie Douglass in order to insert prerecorded laughs into TV and radio programs more easily in the then-developing field of post-production.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Mellotron.jpg/220px-Mellotron.jpg
