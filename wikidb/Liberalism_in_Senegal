It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign â‡’ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn't necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Yellow_flag_waving.svg/100px-Yellow_flag_waving.svg.png
