10.30	Provoleta	Provoleta	Provoleta is a trademark for more than 40 years for an Argentine variant of provolone cheese whose name is “Spinning Argentine provolone cheese.” Is a barbecued cheese dish consumed in Argentina and Uruguay. Natalio Alba is the man who invented this cheese. He understood that to unify the Italian-Argentine food habits, it was interesting to create a cheese that may accompany the roast (as in Italy provolone cheese is very appealing as is the roast in Argentina ). The cheese was first manufactured in about 1940, with the PROVOLETA trade mark dating from 1963. It took several years to find the right spot in the preparation of this cheese so it does not melt when it comes to grilling, and a layer is crispy on the outside and melted a little inside. To achieve this, it incorporates the techniques of pulp layer in the preparation of the mass of the Provolone cheese. Thus was born Provoleta.
