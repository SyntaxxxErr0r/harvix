75.2	RC4	RC4	In cryptography, RC4 (also known as ARC4 or ARCFOUR meaning Alleged RC4, see below) is the most widely used software stream cipher and is used in popular protocols such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (to protect Internet traffic) and WEP (to secure wireless networks). While remarkable for its simplicity and speed in software, RC4 has weaknesses that argue against its use in new systems. It is especially vulnerable when the beginning of the output keystream is not discarded, or nonrandom or related keys are used; some ways of using RC4 can lead to very insecure cryptosystems such as WEP.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/RC4.svg/320px-RC4.svg.png
