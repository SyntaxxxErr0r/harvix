108.1	Labyrinth	Labyrinth	In Greek mythology, the Labyrinth was an elaborate structure designed and built by the legendary artificer Daedalus for King Minos of Crete at Knossos. Its function was to hold the Minotaur, a mythical creature that was half man and half bull and was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus. Daedalus had made the Labyrinth so cunningly that he himself could barely escape it after he built it. Theseus was aided by Ariadne, who provided him with a skein of thread, literally the "clew", or "clue", so he could find his way out again.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Classical_7-Circuit_Labyrinth.jpg/135px-Classical_7-Circuit_Labyrinth.jpg
