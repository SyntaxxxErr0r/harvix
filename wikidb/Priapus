55.0	Priapus	Priapus	In Greek mythology, Priapus or Priapos (Greek: ), was a minor rustic fertility god, protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens and male genitalia. Priapus is marked by his absurdly oversized, permanent erection, which gave rise to the medical term priapism. He became a popular figure in Roman erotic art and Latin literature, and is the subject of the often humorously obscene collection of verse called the Priapeia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg/200px-Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg
