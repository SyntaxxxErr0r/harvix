Nuclear power plants provide about 6% of the world's energy and 13â€“14% of the world's electricity, with the U.S., France, and Japan together accounting for about 50% of nuclear generated electricity. In 2007, the IAEA reported there were 439 nuclear power reactors in operation in the world, operating in 31 countries. Also, more than 150 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion have been built.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Susquehanna_steam_electric_station.jpg/220px-Susquehanna_steam_electric_station.jpg
