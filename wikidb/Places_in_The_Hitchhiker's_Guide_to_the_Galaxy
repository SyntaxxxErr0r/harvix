58.6	Places_in_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy	Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy	This is a list of places featured in Douglas Adams's science fiction series, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The series is set in a fictionalised version of the Milky Way galaxy and thus, while most locations are pure invention, many are based on "real world" settings such as Alpha Centauri, Barnard's Star and various versions of the Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Wikipedias_Guide_-_Mostly_Harmless.png/220px-Wikipedias_Guide_-_Mostly_Harmless.png
