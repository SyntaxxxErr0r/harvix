64.6	Drone_attacks_in_Pakistan	Drone attacks in Pakistan	The United States government has made a series of attacks on targets in northwest Pakistan since 2004 using drones controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency's Special Activities Division. These attacks are part of the United States' War on Terrorism campaign, seeking to defeat Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants in Pakistan. Most of these attacks are on targets in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border in Northwest Pakistan. These strikes have increased substantially under the Presidency of Barack Obama. Some media refer to the series of attacks as a "drone war."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/MQ-9_Afghanistan_takeoff_1_Oct_07.JPG/350px-MQ-9_Afghanistan_takeoff_1_Oct_07.JPG
