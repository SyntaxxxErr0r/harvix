4.00	Passing_tone	Nonchord tone	A nonchord tone or nonharmonic tone is a note in a piece of music which is not a part of the implied harmony that is described by the other notes sounding at the time. Nonchord tones are most often discussed in the context of music of the common practice period, but can be used in analysis of other types of tonal music as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Nonchord_tones.png/220px-Nonchord_tones.png
