55.7	Alaskan_Malamute	Alaskan Malamute	The Alaskan Malamute is a generally large breed of domestic dog originally bred for use as a utilitarian dog and later an Alaskan sled dog. They are sometimes mistaken for a Siberian Husky due to color and markings, but in fact are quite different in many ways including size, structure and personality. As pets, once mature, Alaskan Malamutes have a very quiet, dignified temperament and are loyal to their owners.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Alaskan_Malamute.jpg/220px-Alaskan_Malamute.jpg
