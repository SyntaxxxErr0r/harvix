81.6	Kama_Sutra	Kama Sutra	The Kama Sutra , ) is an ancient Indian Hindu text widely considered to be the standard work on human sexual behavior in Sanskrit literature written by V훮tsy훮yana. A portion of the work consists of practical advice on sexual intercourse. It is largely in prose, with many inserted anustubh poetry verses. "K훮ma" which is one of the three goals of Hindu life, means sensual or sexual pleasure, and "s큰tra" literally means a thread or line that holds things together, and more metaphorically refers to an aphorism (or line, rule, formula), or a collection of such aphorisms in the form of a manual. Contrary to popular perception, especially in the western world, Kama sutra is not an exclusive sex manual; it presents itself as a guide to a virtuous and gracious living that discusses the nature of love, family life and other aspects pertaining to pleasure oriented faculties of human life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Kamasutra5.jpg/220px-Kamasutra5.jpg
