As an area of the world vital to American interests yet generally entrenched in non-democratic, authoritarian rule (with the exceptions of democratic Israel and semi-democratic Lebanon, Iraq, Palestinian National Authority and Turkey), MENA has been the subject of increasing interest on the part of the American government and democracy promoters, particularly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, with many viewing democratic transition as essential to regional stability and international security.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Iraqi_voters_inked_fingers.jpg/220px-Iraqi_voters_inked_fingers.jpg
