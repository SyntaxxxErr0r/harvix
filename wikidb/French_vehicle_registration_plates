6.20	French_vehicle_registration_plates	Vehicle registration plates of France	As of 14 April 2009, all French vehicle registration plates are issued using the XX-NNN-ZZ format, successfully introduced in Italy in 1994, composed of a series of 7 alphanumeric characters, made up of 2 letters, 3 numbers, and then 2 letters (for instance: AB-123-CD). There is no longer a local département code as in the previous system, but only a sequential number. This number is allocated to a vehicle for its life and does not change if the car is sold or the owner moves. There is an option to include a blue strip on the right of the plate, showing the Département Number of the owner's choice, plus the region logo of the chosen département, although this is not compulsory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/AA-229-AA_ref.png/200px-AA-229-AA_ref.png
