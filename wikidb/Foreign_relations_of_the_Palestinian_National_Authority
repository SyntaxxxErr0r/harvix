The Palestinian National Authority was established in 1994 following the Oslo Accords and the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement. The Israeli government transferred certain powers and responsibilities of self-government to the PNA, which are in effect in parts of the West Bank, and used to be effective in the Gaza Strip before its takeover by Hamas. Foreign relations by the PNA are conducted by the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian National Authority, who since July 2007 has been Riyad Al-Maliki.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Palestinian_National_Authority_COA.svg/125px-Palestinian_National_Authority_COA.svg.png
