69.9	Adrenal_gland	Adrenal gland	In mammals, the adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that sit atop the kidneys; in humans, the right suprarenal gland is triangular shaped, while the left suprarenal gland is semilunar shaped. They are chiefly responsible for releasing hormones in response to stress through the synthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol and catecholamines such as epinephrine. The adrenal glands affect kidney function through the secretion of aldosterone, a hormone involved in regulating the osmolarity of blood plasma.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Illu_endocrine_system_New.png/250px-Illu_endocrine_system_New.png
