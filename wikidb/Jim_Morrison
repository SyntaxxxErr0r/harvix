195.6	Jim_Morrison	Jim Morrison	James Douglas "Jim" Morrison (December 8, 1943 â€“ July 3, 1971) was the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band The Doors, as well as a poet. Following The Doors' explosive rise to fame in 1967, Morrison developed a severe alcohol and drug dependency that culminated in his death at the age of 27 in Paris. He is presumed to have died from a heroin overdose, but as no autopsy was performed, the events surrounding his death and the exact cause of it continue to be disputed by many to this day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Jim_Morrisonsinging.jpg/220px-Jim_Morrisonsinging.jpg
