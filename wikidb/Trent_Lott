108.6	Trent_Lott	Trent Lott	Chester Trent Lott, Sr. (born October 9, 1941), is a former United States Senator from Mississippi and has served in numerous leadership positions in the House of Representatives and the Senate. He entered Congress as one of the first of a wave of Republicans winning seats in Southern states that had been solidly Democratic for a century, rose to the position of Senate majority leader, then fell from power after praising Strom Thurmond's 1948 segregationist Dixiecrat presidential bid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Trent_Lott_official_portrait.jpg/240px-Trent_Lott_official_portrait.jpg
