58.0	Wingsuit_flying	Wingsuit flying	Wingsuit flying is the sport of flying the human body through the air using a special jumpsuit, called a wingsuit, which adds surface area to the human body to enable a significant increase in lift. Modern wingsuits, first developed in the late 1990s, create the surface area with fabric between the legs and under the arms. A wingsuit may be referred to as a birdman suit, flying squirrel suit, or bat suit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wingsuit-01.jpg/300px-Wingsuit-01.jpg
