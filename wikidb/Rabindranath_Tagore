153.8	Rabindranath_Tagore	Rabindranath Tagore	Rabindranath Tagoreα β (Bengali: ; 7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941),γ sobriquet Gurudev,δ was an Indian Bengali polymath who reshaped his region's literature and music. Author of Gitanjali and its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; his seemingly mesmeric personality, flowing hair, and other-worldly dress earned him a prophet-like reputation in the West. His "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Tagore3.jpg/225px-Tagore3.jpg
