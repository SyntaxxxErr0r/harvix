96.6	Platypus	Platypus	The platypus is a semi-aquatic mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five extant species of monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. It is the sole living representative of its family (Ornithorhynchidae) and genus (Ornithorhynchus), though a number of related species have been found in the fossil record.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Platypus_BrokenRiver_QLD_Australia2.png/250px-Platypus_BrokenRiver_QLD_Australia2.png
