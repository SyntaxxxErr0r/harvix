2.00	Development_theories	Developmental stage theories	One of the major controversies in developmental psychology centres around whether development is continuous or discontinuous. Stage theories of development rest on the assumption that development is a discontinuous process involving distinct stages which are characterized by qualitative differences in behaviour. They also assume that the structure of the stages is not variable according to each individual, however the time of each stage may vary individually . Stage theories can be contrasted with continuous theories, which posit that development is an incremental process.
