Khrulyov was wounded in the ensuing firefight. Vetchinov, armed with a trophy Georgian machine gun, organised defence but was wounded in both legs. He continued firing at the enemy and killed a Georgian soldier. Vetchinov kept covering fire until he was hit in the head by Georgian fire. He died on the way to hospital. On 15 August Denis Vetchinov was posthumuously awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation golden star "for courage and heroism while fulfilling his duty in the North Caucasus region". He is survived by his wife and little daughter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82_%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B0.JPG/220px-%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82_%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B0.JPG
