1.00	If_You_See_Her	If You See Her	If You See Her is the fifth studio album by country music duo Brooks &amp; Dunn, released in 1998 on Arista Nashville. The album featured five chart singles: "If You See Him/If You See Her" (#1), "How Long Gone" (#1), "Husbands and Wives" (a cover of a Roger Miller song) (#1), "I Can't Get Over You" (#5), and "South of Santa Fe" (#41). This last song was the first (and only) single of Brooks &amp; Dunn's career to miss Top 40 entirely, and was the last single to feature Kix Brooks on lead vocals instead of Ronnie Dunn. The album is a counterpart to Reba McEntire's album If You See Him (also released in 1998), which shared the track "If You See Him/If You See Her". A bonus limited edition EP was made available when consumers bought both If You See Him and If You See Her at the same time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/ff/IfYouSeeHer.jpg/220px-IfYouSeeHer.jpg
