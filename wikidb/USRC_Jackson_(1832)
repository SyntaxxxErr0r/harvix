1.00	USRC_Jackson_(1832)	USRC Jackson (1832)	The United States Revenue Cutter Jackson was one of 13 cutters of the Morris-Taney Class to be launched. Named after Secretaries of the Treasury and Presidents of the United States, these cutters were the backbone of the Service for more than a decade. Samuel Humphreys designed these cutters for roles as diverse as fighting pirates, privateers, combating smugglers and operating with naval forces. He designed the vessels on a naval schooner concept. They had Baltimore Clipper lines. The vessels built by Webb and Allen, designed by Isaac Webb, resembled Humphreys' but had one less port.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Revenue_cutter.jpg/300px-Revenue_cutter.jpg
