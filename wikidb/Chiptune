194.9	Chiptune	Chiptune	A chiptune, also known as chip music, is synthesized electronic music often produced with the sound chips of vintage computers and video game consoles, as well as with other methods such as emulation. In the early 1980s, personal computers became less expensive and more accessible than they had previously been. This led to a proliferation of outdated personal computers and game consoles that had been abandoned by consumers as they upgraded to newer machines. They were in low demand by consumers as a whole, and not difficult to find, making them a highly accessible and affordable method of creating sound or art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Chiptune-Setup-Game-Boys.jpg/235px-Chiptune-Setup-Game-Boys.jpg
