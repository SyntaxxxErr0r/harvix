57.4	Critic	Critic	A critic is anyone who expresses a value judgement. Informally, criticism is a common aspect of all human expression and need not necessarily imply skilled or accurate expressions of judgement. Critical judgements, good or bad, may be positive (in praise of an object of attention), negative (in dispraise), or balanced (weighing a combination of factors both for and against). Since all criticism must be regarded as having a purpose, a critic may also be definable by his or her specific motivation. At its simplest, and for whatever reason, a critic may have either constructive or destructive intent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Brooklyn_Museum_-_The_Critic_-_Lajos_Tihanyi.jpg/290px-Brooklyn_Museum_-_The_Critic_-_Lajos_Tihanyi.jpg
