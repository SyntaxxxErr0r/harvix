14.22	Sunshine_policy	Sunshine Policy	The Sunshine Policy was the foreign policy of South Korea towards North Korea until Lee Myung-bak's election to presidency in 2008. Since its articulation in 1998 by South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, the policy resulted in greater political contact between the two States and some historical moments for the Korean peninsula; the two Korean summit meetings in Pyongyang (June 2000) which broke ground with several high-profile business ventures, as well as brief meetings of separated family members.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Coat_of_arms_of_South_Korea.svg/125px-Coat_of_arms_of_South_Korea.svg.png
