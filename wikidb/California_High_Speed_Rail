Initial funding for the project was approved by California voters on November 4, 2008, with the passage of Proposition 1A authorizing the issuance of US$9.95 billion in general obligation bonds for the project. The CHSRA is currently tasked with completing final planning, design, and environmental efforts. The system would serve major cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Jose, Fresno, Bakersfield, Palmdale, Anaheim, Irvine, Riverside, and San Diego.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c5/California_High_Speed_Rail.svg/100px-California_High_Speed_Rail.svg.png
