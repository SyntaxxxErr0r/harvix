54.3	Wi-fi	Wi-Fi	Wi-Fi ( , sometimes spelled Wifi or WiFi) is a popular technology that allows an electronic device to exchange data wirelessly (using radio waves) over a computer network, including high-speed Internet connections. The Wi-Fi Alliance defines Wi-Fi as any "wireless local area network (WLAN) products that are based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 802.11 standards". However, since most modern WLANs are based on these standards, the term "Wi-Fi" is used in general English as a synonym for "WLAN".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Wi-Fi_Logo.svg/220px-Wi-Fi_Logo.svg.png
