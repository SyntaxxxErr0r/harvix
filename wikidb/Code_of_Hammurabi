98.6	Code_of_Hammurabi	Code of Hammurabi	The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian law code, dating back to about 1772 BC. It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a human-sized stone stele and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Code-de-Hammurabi-1.jpg/200px-Code-de-Hammurabi-1.jpg
