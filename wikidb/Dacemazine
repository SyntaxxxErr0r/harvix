1.30	Dacemazine	Dacemazine	Dacemazine is a phenothiazine derivative which acts as an histamine antagonist at the H1 subtype. First described in 1951, it was never marketed as a drug on its own, although a combination of dacemazine and di-tert-butylnaphthalenesulfonate was sold as an antispasmodic and antitussive under the trade name Codopectyl. It was also assessed as a possible anticancer drug.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Dacemazine.png/260px-Dacemazine.png
