2.00	Palaeotringa	Palaeotringa	Palaeotringa is a prehistoric bird genus that was discovered by O. C. Marsh during the bone wars. Its remains were found in the controversial Hornerstown Formation of New Jersey which straddles the Cretaceous-Paleocene boundary some 66 million years ago. Though it cannot be said if these birds lived before or after the K-Pg extinction event, they were in all likelihood wading birds that inhabited the coasts of the northwestern Atlantic.
