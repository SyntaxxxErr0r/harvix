2.00	Civilian_(Gentle_Giant_album)	Civilian (Gentle Giant album)	Civilian is an album by British progressive rock band Gentle Giant which was released in 1980. At this point a near total change of style was in evidence with only a trace of the original verve present. The band lasted only a short time after this outing. This album also marks the return to Columbia Records (the first album on this famous label since the 1973 release Octopus) in the U.S. and Canada. It was cut in the L.A. suburb of Van Nuys in 1979 with former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/GentleGiant_Civilian.jpg/220px-GentleGiant_Civilian.jpg
