Business and government entities utilize WANs to relay data among employees, clients, buyers, and suppliers from various geographical locations. In essence this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/LAN_WAN_scheme.svg/300px-LAN_WAN_scheme.svg.png
