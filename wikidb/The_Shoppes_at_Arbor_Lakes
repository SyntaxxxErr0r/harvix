Construction of Arbor Lakes began in the late 1990s with a simulacrum of a traditional American Main Street designed in neotraditional style. The second phase (completed in 2003) included the Shoppes at Arbor Lakes, Minnesota's first lifestyle center, which includes neotraditional elements. The third phase, The Fountains at Arbor Lakes, is approximately 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) in size and includes a Main Street-inspired entrance, with two hotels, several restaurants, and a number of junior anchors. The fourth phase, Reflections at Arbor Lakes, will include a four-star Radisson Hotel, senior housing, office complexes, and some retail.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Maple_Grove%27s_Shoppes_at_Arbor_Lakes_-_East_End.jpg/200px-Maple_Grove%27s_Shoppes_at_Arbor_Lakes_-_East_End.jpg
