1.30	Political_Compass	Political compass	The political compass is a multi-axis model, used by the website of the same name, to label or organize political thought on two dimensions. In its selection and representation of these two dimensions, it is similar to the Nolan Chart and Pournelle Chart. The term "Political Compass" is claimed as a trademark by the British website, The Political Compass, which uses responses to a set of 61 propositions to rate political views on two axes: Economic and Social (Authoritarian-Libertarian). The site also includes an explanation of the two-axis system they use, a few charts which place various past and present political figures according to their estimation, and reading lists for each of the main political orientations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Political_chart.svg/250px-Political_chart.svg.png
