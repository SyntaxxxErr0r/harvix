55.4	Same-sex_marriage_in_Massachusetts	Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts	Same-sex marriage in the U.S. state of Massachusetts began on May 17, 2004, as a result of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruling in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that it was unconstitutional under the Massachusetts constitution to allow only heterosexual couples to marry. Massachusetts became the sixth jurisdiction in the world (after the Netherlands, Belgium, Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec) to legalize same-sex marriage. It was the first U.S. state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Mass_statehouse_rainbow_flag.jpg/150px-Mass_statehouse_rainbow_flag.jpg
