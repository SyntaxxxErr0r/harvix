78.0	Ape	Ape	Apes are Old World anthropoid mammals, more specifically a clade of tailless catarrhine primates, belonging to the biological superfamily Hominoidea. The apes are native to Africa and South-east Asia. Apes are the world's largest primates; the orangutan, an ape, is the world's largest living arboreal animal. Hominoids are traditionally forest dwellers, although chimpanzees may range into savanna, and the extinct australopithecines are famous for being savanna inhabitants, inferred from their morphology. Humans inhabit almost every terrestrial habitat.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Weisshandgibbon_tierpark_berlin.jpg/250px-Weisshandgibbon_tierpark_berlin.jpg
