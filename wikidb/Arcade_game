66.0	Arcade_game	Arcade game	An arcade game is played on a coin-operated entertainment machine, usually installed in public businesses, such as restaurants, bars, and particularly amusement arcades. These days it can refer to a video game that was designed to look like an arcade game (adopting the isometric view, 2D graphics, scores, lives ect) but instead released on XBLA or PC. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games, and merchandisers (such as claw cranes). The golden age of video arcade games was from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, and while arcade games were still relatively popular during the first half of the 1990s, this type of media saw a continuous decline in popularity when video game consoles made the transition from 2D to 3D.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Vg_icon.svg/150px-Vg_icon.svg.png
