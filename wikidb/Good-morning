8.30	Good-morning	Good-morning	The good-morning is a weight-lifting exercise. The movement resembles bowing to greet someone "good morning". The erector spinae muscles of the lower back work isometrically to keep the spine in an extended position while the hamstrings and gluteus maximus work isotonically to perform hip extension. Other muscles are involved in stabilizing weight on the back and maintaining balance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/Good-Mornings.png/450px-Good-Mornings.png
