15.40	Tula,_Hidalgo	Tula, Hidalgo	The site was extensively looted in Aztec times, with much of the artwork and sculpture carted off. Human figures known as “atlantids” served as main pillars in the temple that stood atop the main pyramid. The entrance was flanked by pillars sculpted in the form of the feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl. The serpent pillars are now missing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Panor%C3%A1mica_de_la_zona_arqueologica_de_Tula.JPG/300px-Panor%C3%A1mica_de_la_zona_arqueologica_de_Tula.JPG
