4.00	Cote_Rotie	Côte-Rôtie AOC	Côte-Rôtie is a French wine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France. The vineyards are located just south of Vienne in the communes of Saint-Cyr-sur-le-Rhône, Ampuis, and Tupin-et-Semons. The vineyards are unique because of their vertical slopes and their stone walls. Côte-Rôtie can be rendered in English as "the roasted slope" and refers to the long hours of sunlight that these steep slopes receive.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Terrasse_de_C%C3%B4te_R%C3%B4tie_en_hiver.jpg/220px-Terrasse_de_C%C3%B4te_R%C3%B4tie_en_hiver.jpg
