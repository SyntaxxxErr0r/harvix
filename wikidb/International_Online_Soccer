The game is a modification of the Half-Life engine. It is played in first and third person. IOS is intended to be an online equivalent to popular console soccer games but with the multiplayer experience of an online game. Instead of controlling a whole team of players, you control just 1 player and play football with other human players on the server.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/International_Online_Soccer_Logo.png
