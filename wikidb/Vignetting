60.7	Vignetting	Vignetting	In photography and optics, vignettingâ€‚(French: "vignette") is a reduction of an image's brightness or saturation at the periphery compared to the image center. The word vignette, from the same root as vine, originally referred to a decorative border in a book. Later, the word came to be used for a photographic portrait which is clear in the center, and fades off at the edges. A similar effect occurs when filming projected images or movies off a projection screen. The resulting so-called "hotspot" effect defines a cheap home-movie look where no proper telecine is used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Backlight-wedding.jpg/210px-Backlight-wedding.jpg
