1.00	Boilie	Boilie	Boilies are boiled paste fishing baits, usually combinations of fishmeals, milk proteins, bird foods, semolina and soya flour, which are mixed with eggs as a binding agent and then boiled to form hardish round baits which will last in the water. Additional flavourings and attractors are also usually included in the mix. The round shape allows the baits to be catapulted accurately when fishing at range.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Boilies.jpg/220px-Boilies.jpg
