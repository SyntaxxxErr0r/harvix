69.9	Ronald_McDonald	Ronald McDonald	Ronald McDonald is a clown character used as the primary mascot of the McDonald's fast-food restaurant chain. In television commercials, the clown inhabits a fantasy world called McDonaldland, and has adventures with his friends Mayor McCheese, the Hamburglar, Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird, and The Fry Kids. In recent years, McDonaldland has been largely phased out, and Ronald is instead shown interacting with normal kids in their everyday lives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Ronwai01.JPG/250px-Ronwai01.JPG
