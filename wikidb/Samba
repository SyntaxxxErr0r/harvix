60.1	Samba	Samba	The modern samba that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century is basically 2/4 tempo varied with the conscious use of chorus sung to the sound of palms and batucada rhythm, adding one or more parts or stanzas of declaratory verses. Traditionally, the samba is played by strings (cavaquinho and various types of guitar) and various percussion instruments such as tamborim. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the Second World War and the cultural impact of US music post-war, samba began to use trombones, trumpets, choros, flutes, and clarinets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Samba_Parade_-_Rio%27s_Carnival_2008.jpg/170px-Samba_Parade_-_Rio%27s_Carnival_2008.jpg
