1.01	Lincoln_Y-block_V8_engine	Lincoln Y-block V8 engine	The Lincoln Y-block V8 engine, Ford's earliest OHV V8 engine, was introduced by Lincoln in the 1952 model year. Like the later (and better-known) Ford Y-block engine, its deep skirts made the block resemble the letter Y from the front. This development was arguably in response to the sales success of the competing Oldsmobile "Rocket" and Cadillac OHV V8 engines introduced in their respective 1949 models as well as the need for larger and more powerful truck engines. This basic engine design was produced through 1963. It was replaced by the newer MEL engine for car applications in 1958, and was gradually replaced by the larger Ford Super Duty engine, which had also been introduced in 1958, for heavy duty truck applications.
