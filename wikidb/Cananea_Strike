3.00	Cananea_Strike	Cananea strike	The Cananea Strike, also known as the Cananea Riot, or the Cananea Massacre, took place in the Mexican mining town of Cananea, Sonora, in June 1906. Although the workers were forced to return to their positions with no demand being met, the action was a key event in the general unrest that emerged during the final years of the regime of President Porfirio DÃ­az and that prefigured the Mexican Revolution of 1910. In the incident twenty-three people died, on both sides, twenty-two were injured, and more than fifty were arrested.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Cananea_tienda_de_raya.jpg/300px-Cananea_tienda_de_raya.jpg
