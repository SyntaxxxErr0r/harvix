The breed was developed to create a companion sized version of the Alaskan Husky (a mixed breed of dog used for sled racing), resulting in an energetic, intelligent, apartment-sized dog with an appearance that reflects its northern heritage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/WOWAKK-Kukai-Alaskan-Klee-Kai.jpg/220px-WOWAKK-Kukai-Alaskan-Klee-Kai.jpg
