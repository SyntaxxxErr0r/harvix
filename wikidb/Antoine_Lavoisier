74.0	Antoine_Lavoisier	Antoine Lavoisier	Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier (also Antoine Lavoisier after the French Revolution; 26 August 1743 â€“ 8 May 1794; French pronunciation: ), the "father of modern chemistry", was a French nobleman prominent in the histories of chemistry and biology. He named both oxygen (1778) and hydrogen (1783) and helped construct the metric system, put together the first extensive list of elements, and helped to reform chemical nomenclature. He was also the first to establish that sulfur was an element (1777) rather than a compound. He discovered that, although matter may change its form or shape, its mass always remains the same.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Antoine_lavoisier_color.jpg/220px-Antoine_lavoisier_color.jpg
