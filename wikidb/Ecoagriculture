3.11	Ecoagriculture	Ecoagriculture	While many rural communities have independently practiced ecoagriculture for thousands of years, over the past century many of these landscapes have given way to segregated land use patterns, with some areas employing intensive farming practices without regard to biodiversity impacts, and other areas fenced off completely for habitat or watershed protection. A new ecoagriculture movement is now gaining momentum to unite land managers and other stakeholders from diverse environments to find compatible ways to conserve biodiversity while also enhancing agricultural production.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Elements_in_an_ecoagriculture_landscape.jpg/220px-Elements_in_an_ecoagriculture_landscape.jpg
