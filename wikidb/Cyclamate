27.38	Cyclamate	Sodium cyclamate	Sodium cyclamate (sweetener code 952) is an artificial sweetener. It is 30â€“50 times sweeter than sugar (depending on concentration; it is not a linear relationship), making it the least potent of the commercially used artificial sweeteners. Some people find it to have an unpleasant aftertaste, but, in general, less so than saccharin or acesulfame potassium. It is often used synergistically with other artificial sweeteners, especially saccharin; the mixture of 10 parts cyclamate to 1 part saccharin is common and masks the off-tastes of both sweeteners. It is less expensive than most sweeteners, including sucralose, and is stable under heating.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Cyclamate_Structural_Formulae_.V.1.svg/200px-Cyclamate_Structural_Formulae_.V.1.svg.png
