80.1	Guild	Guild	A guild (German: Gilde) is an association of craftsmen in a particular trade. The earliest types of guild were formed as confraternities of workers. They were organized in a manner something between a trade union, a cartel, and a secret society. They often depended on grants of letters patent by a monarch or other authority to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials. A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the guildhalls constructed and used as meeting places.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Windsorguildhall.jpg/300px-Windsorguildhall.jpg
