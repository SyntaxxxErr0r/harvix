3.11	WWE_Elimination_Chamber	WWE Elimination Chamber	Elimination Chamber is a professional wrestling pay-per-view event, produced every February by WWE, a professional wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 2010, replacing No Way Out. Despite the replacement, the event is still promoted as No Way Out in Germany. Since its origin, each event has been held in an indoor arena, with all three taking place in the United States. Championship bouts are scheduled on every card, with the lower-tier titles featured on the undercard and the top-tier featured on the main card. Under the Brand Extension, WWE assigns its performers to either Raw or SmackDown which cause matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3e/WWE_EC_logo.png/250px-WWE_EC_logo.png
