86.2	Menopause	Menopause	Menopause is a term used to describe the permanent cessation of the primary functions of the human ovaries: the ripening and release of ova and the release of hormones that cause both the creation of the uterine lining and the subsequent shedding of the uterine lining (a.k.a. the menses or the period). Menopause typically (but not always) occurs in women in midlife, during their late 40s or early 50s, and signals the end of the fertile phase of a woman's life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Uzbeki_girl.jpg/120px-Uzbeki_girl.jpg
