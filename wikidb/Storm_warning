6.00	Storm_warning	Storm warning	At sea, a storm warning is a warning issued by the National Weather Service of the United States when winds between 48 knots (89 km/h, 55 mph) and 63 knots (117 km/h, 73 mph) are occurring or predicted to occur soon. The winds must not be associated with a tropical cyclone. If the winds are associated with a tropical cyclone, a Tropical Storm Warning will be substituted for the Storm Warning and less severe Gale Warning. The same flag as a storm warning is used for a Tropical Storm Warning.
