1.00	6.9	Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9	The Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 is a high-performance version of the S-Class luxury saloon. It was built on its own assembly line by Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart, Germany and based on the long-wheelbase version of the W116 chassis introduced in 1972. The model was generally referred to in the company's literature as the "6.9", to separate it from the regular 450SEL.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/450SELI_0411.jpg/250px-450SELI_0411.jpg
