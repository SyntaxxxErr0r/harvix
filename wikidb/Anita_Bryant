59.6	Anita_Bryant	Anita Bryant	Anita Jane Bryant (born March 25, 1940) is an American singer, former Miss Oklahoma beauty pageant winner, and outspoken critic of homosexuality. She scored four Top 40 hits in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including "Paper Roses", which reached #5. She later became widely known for her strong views against homosexuality and for her prominent campaigning in 1977 to repeal a local ordinance in Dade County, Florida, that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, an involvement that significantly damaged her popularity and career.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Anita_Bryant_Billboard_1971.jpg/250px-Anita_Bryant_Billboard_1971.jpg
