132.7	Fahrenheit	Fahrenheit	Fahrenheit is the temperature scale proposed in 1724 by, and named after, the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686â€“1736). Within this scale, the freezing of water into ice is defined at 32 degrees, while the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 degrees. The Fahrenheit scale was replaced by the Celsius scale in most countries during the mid to late 20th century, though Canada retains it as a supplementary scale that can be used alongside Celsius. Fahrenheit remains the official scale of the United States, Cayman Islands and Belize. The Rankine temperature scale was based upon the Fahrenheit temperature scale, with its zero representing absolute zero instead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Raumthermometer_Fahrenheit%2BCelsius.jpg/220px-Raumthermometer_Fahrenheit%2BCelsius.jpg
