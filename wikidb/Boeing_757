62.9	Boeing_757	Boeing 757	The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body twin-engine jet airliner that was built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes from 1981 to 2004. It was its manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft. The twinjet features a two-crew glass cockpit, turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed to replace the three-engined 727 on short and medium airline routes, the 757 has a capacity of 186 to 289 persons and a maximum range of 3,100 to 4,100 nautical miles (5,700 to 7,600 km), depending on variant. Development of the 757 occurred in tandem with the 767, a wide-body twinjet, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/American_Airlines_Boeing_757-200_N605AA_SJC.jpg/300px-American_Airlines_Boeing_757-200_N605AA_SJC.jpg
