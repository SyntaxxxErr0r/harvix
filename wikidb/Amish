238.9	Amish	Amish	The Amish ( -mish; Pennsylvania Dutch: Amisch, German: Amische), sometimes referred to as Amish Mennonites, are a group of Christian church fellowships that form a subgroup of the Mennonite churches. The Amish are known for simple living, plain dress, and reluctance to adopt many conveniences of modern technology. The history of the Amish church began with a schism in Switzerland within a group of Swiss and Alsatian Anabaptists in 1693 led by Jakob Ammann. Those who followed Ammann became known as Amish.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Lancaster_County_Amish_03.jpg/200px-Lancaster_County_Amish_03.jpg
