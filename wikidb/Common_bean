51.0	Common_bean	Phaseolus vulgaris	Phaseolus vulgaris, the common bean, is a herbaceous annual plant domesticated independently in ancient Mesoamerica and the Andes, and now grown worldwide for its edible bean, popular both dry and as a green bean. The leaf is occasionally used as a leaf vegetable, and the straw is used for fodder. Beans, squash and maize constituted the "Three Sisters" that provided the foundation of Native American agriculture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Snijboon_peulen_Phaseolus_vulgaris.jpg/220px-Snijboon_peulen_Phaseolus_vulgaris.jpg
