149.1	James_Clerk_Maxwell	James Clerk Maxwell	James Clerk Maxwell of Glenlair (13 June 1831 â€“ 5 November 1879) was a Scottish physicist and mathematician. His most prominent achievement was formulating classical electromagnetic theory. This unites all previously unrelated observations, experiments and equations of electricity, magnetism and optics into a consistent theory. Maxwell's equations demonstrate that electricity, magnetism and light are all manifestations of the same phenomenon, namely the electromagnetic field. Subsequently, all other classic laws or equations of these disciplines became simplified cases of Maxwell's equations. Maxwell's achievements concerning electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics", after the first one realised by Isaac Newton.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/James_Clerk_Maxwell.png/225px-James_Clerk_Maxwell.png
