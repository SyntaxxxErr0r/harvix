Generally speaking, the first-person shooter shares common traits with other shooter games, which in turn fall under the heading action game. From the genre's inception, advanced 3D or pseudo-3D graphics elements have challenged hardware development, and multiplayer gaming has been integral.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Doom_ingame_2.png/250px-Doom_ingame_2.png
