104.8	Mineral	Mineral	A mineral is a naturally occurring solid chemical substance formed through biogeochemical processes, having characteristic chemical composition, highly ordered atomic structure, and specific physical properties. By comparison, a rock is an aggregate of minerals and/or mineraloids and does not have a specific chemical composition. Minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with thousands of known forms. The study of minerals is called mineralogy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Different_minerals.jpg/250px-Different_minerals.jpg
