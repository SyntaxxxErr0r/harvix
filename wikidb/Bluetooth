372.6	Bluetooth	Bluetooth	Bluetooth is a proprietary open wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength radio transmissions in the ISM band from 2400â€“2480 MHz) from fixed and mobile devices, creating personal area networks (PANs) with high levels of security. Created by telecoms vendor Ericsson in 1994, it was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables. It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of synchronization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/BluetoothLogo.svg/200px-BluetoothLogo.svg.png
