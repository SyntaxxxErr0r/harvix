81.1	Penguin	Penguin	Penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have become flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid, and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Pygoscelis_papua.jpg/250px-Pygoscelis_papua.jpg
