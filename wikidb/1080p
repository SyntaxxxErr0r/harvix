146.8	1080p	1080p	The filmmaking industry has embraced 1080p24 (i.e., 1080p displayed at 24 frames per second) as a digital mastering format in both native 24p form and in 24PsF form. 1080p24 has become an established production standard for digital cinematography and there is plenty of equipment capable of capturing and processing 1080p24 signals. This may be the first universal video standard, transcending continental boundaries, putting it in a category with 24-frame film.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Progressive_scan_hdtv.svg/220px-Progressive_scan_hdtv.svg.png
