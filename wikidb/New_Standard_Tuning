15.22	New_Standard_Tuning	New standard tuning	The new standard tuning (NST) is a special type of guitar tuning (CGDAEG), introduced by Robert Fripp of King Crimson, who has stated that the tuning "flew by" while he was sweating in a sauna in September 1983. Fripp began using the tuning in 1985 after stepping out of the spotlight before beginning his Guitar Craft seminars. Although used by a small number of players in comparison to the standard guitar tuning (referred to as 'Old Standard Tuning' by NST players), it has gained some popularity among experimental guitarists, and is the tuning taught at Fripp's Guitar Craft. The tuning is (from low to high): CGDAEG, and can be remembered by the mnemonic "California Guitarists Drop Acid Every Gig", according to the program booklet sold at the UK end of the Double Trio tour.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/New_standard_tuning.png/220px-New_standard_tuning.png
