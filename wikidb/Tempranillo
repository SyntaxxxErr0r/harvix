54.3	Tempranillo	Tempranillo	Tempranillo is a variety of black grape widely grown to make full-bodied red wines in its native Spain. It is the main grape used in Rioja, and is often referred to as Spain's "noble grape". Its name is the diminutive of the Spanish temprano ("early"), a reference to the fact that it ripens several weeks earlier than most Spanish red grapes. In the last 100 years it has been planted in Mexico, New Zealand, South America, USA, South Africa, Australia, Turkey and Canada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Tempranillo_vine_with_grape_clusters.jpg/215px-Tempranillo_vine_with_grape_clusters.jpg
