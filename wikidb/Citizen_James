1.00	Citizen_James	Citizen James	Citizen James is a BBC sitcom that ran for three series between 24 November 1960 and 1962. The show featured comedian and actor Sid James (best remembered for his roles in the Carry On films), Bill Kerr, Liz Fraser and Sydney Tafler. It was written by the comedy writing team of Galton and Simpson, who based the characters very much on the "Sidney Balmoral James" and "Bill Kerr, the dim-witted Australian" roles that they had played in Hancock's Half Hour.
