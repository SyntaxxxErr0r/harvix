2.20	Bongo_Bong	Bongo Bong	"Bongo Bong" is the first solo single by Manu Chao from his first album, Clandestino. It is his most successful and recognisable songâ€”a remake of Mano Negra's song, "King of Bongo" (1991), which has its roots from a 1939 recording of "King of the Bongo Bong" by the trumpeter Roy Eldridge. It also uses the background music from Black Uhuru's song "Bull ina di Pen" from their "Anthem" album. It is part of a medley with "Je Ne T'Aime Plus" on the album. The music has been reused for other songs such as "Mr. Bobby" which was first released on this single before being re-recorded for his second album and "Homens" from the same album.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/ManuChaoBongoBongCDSingleCover.jpg
