6.10	Chindonya	Chindon'ya	Chindon'ya (チンドン屋), also called Japanese marching band, and in the old times also called tōzaiya (東西屋) or hiromeya (広目屋 or 披露目屋) are a type of elaborately costumed street musicians in Japan that advertise for shops and other establishments. The performers advertised the opening of new stores and other venues, or promoted special events such as price discounts. Nowadays, chindon'yas are rare in Japan. The word consists of Japanese sound symbolism chin and don to describe the instruments, and the -ya suffix which roughly equates to the English "-er" suffix in this context.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Chindonya_Okubo_Tokyo.jpg/250px-Chindonya_Okubo_Tokyo.jpg
