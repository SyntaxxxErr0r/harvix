73.7	Alexander_Scriabin	Alexander Scriabin	Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin (Russian: ; 6 January 1872 – 27 April 1915) was a Russian composer and pianist. Scriabin's work initially possessed a lyrical and idiosyncratic tonal language in line with the innovations of Frédéric Chopin, but developed an increasingly atonal and dissonant sound. Scriabin is known for developing, independent of the advances of Arnold Schoenberg, an atonal musical system, accorded to mysticism, that presaged twelve-tone composition and other serial music. Scriabin innovated several new harmonic techniques initially based on romanticism but moving increasingly into contemporary musical atonality; he is known for associating colors with the various harmonic tones of his atonal scale. Scriabin was influenced by a kind of synesthesia, and his color-coded circle of fifths was also influenced by a kind of theosophy. He may be considered to be the main Russian Symbolist composer. Scriabin is also known for his eccentricities and mystical beliefs, which contributed to the angle at which he approached music and harmonization. Scriabin was one of the most innovative and most controversial of early modern composers. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia said of Scriabin that, "No composer has had more scorn heaped or greater love bestowed..." Leo Tolstoy once described Scriabin's music as "a sincere expression of genius."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Skrjabin_Alexander.jpg/220px-Skrjabin_Alexander.jpg
