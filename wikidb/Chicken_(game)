62.9	Chicken_(game)	Chicken (game)	The game of chicken, also known as the hawk-dove or snowdrift game, is an influential model of conflict for two players in game theory. The principle of the game is that while each player prefers not to yield to the other, the worst possible outcome occurs when both players do not yield.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Reaction-correspondence-hawk-dove.jpg/500px-Reaction-correspondence-hawk-dove.jpg
