108.6	Noble_Eightfold_Path	Noble Eightfold Path	The Noble Eightfold Path (PƒÅli: , Sanskrit: , Sinhala: ), is one of the principal teachings of the Buddha, who described it as the way leading to the cessation of suffering and the achievement of self-awakening. It is used to develop insight into the true nature of phenomena (or reality) and to eradicate greed, hatred, and delusion. The Noble Eightfold Path is the fourth of the Buddha's Four Noble Truths; the first element of the Noble Eightfold Path is, in turn, an understanding of the Four Noble Truths. It is also known as the Middle Path or Middle Way.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/220px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png
