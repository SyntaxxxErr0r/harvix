7.10	Gray's_monitor	Gray's monitor	Gray's monitor is a large (180 cm, &gt;9 kg) monitor lizard known only from lowland dipterocarp forest in the east of Luzon and a few smaller adjacent islands in the Philippines such as Polillo Island, where it is locally known as the butaan. It belongs to the subgenus Philippinosaurus. It is largely arboreal and extremely shy. It is classed as vulnerable by the IUCN because most of its habitat has been destroyed over the last 60 years. Its diet consists primarily of fruit, especially Pandanus, and snails.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Status_iucn3.1_VU.svg/220px-Status_iucn3.1_VU.svg.png
