55.1	Macrobiotic_diet	Macrobiotic diet	A macrobiotic diet (or macrobiotics), from "macro" (large) and "bios" (life), is a dietary regimen which involves eating grains as a staple food supplemented with other foodstuffs such as local vegetables, avoiding the use of highly processed or refined foods and most animal products. Macrobiotics also addresses the manner of eating by recommending against overeating and requiring that food be chewed thoroughly before swallowing. Macrobiotics writers present it as a means of combating cancer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Hufeland_1797.jpg/220px-Hufeland_1797.jpg
