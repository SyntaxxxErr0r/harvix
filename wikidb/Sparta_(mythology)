1.10	Sparta_(mythology)	Sparta (mythology)	In Greek mythology, Sparta was the daughter of Eurotas by Clete. She was wife of Lacedaemon (also her uncle) by whom she became the mother of Amyclas and Eurydice of Argos (no relation to Orpheus' Eurydice). The city of Sparta is said to have been named after her; however, the city was often called Lacedaemon as well. The two names were used interchangeably. Sparta was represented on a sacrificial tripod at Amyclae.
