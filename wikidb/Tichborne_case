1.10	Tichborne_case	Tichborne Case	The Tichborne case was a legal cause célèbre that captivated Victorian England in the 1860s and 1870s. It concerned the claims by an individual otherwise known as Thomas Castro or Arthur Orton, but usually referred to as the Claimant, to be the missing heir to the Tichborne baronetcy. A civil action brought by the Claimant failed to convince the court, and he was convicted of perjury in the criminal trial that followed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/RogerTichborne.jpg/220px-RogerTichborne.jpg
