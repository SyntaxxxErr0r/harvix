70.4	Wag_the_Dog	Wag the Dog	Wag the Dog is a 1997 black comedy film starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro, co-starring Anne Heche, Denis Leary and William H. Macy about a Washington spin doctor who, merely days before a presidential election, distracts the electorate from a sex scandal by hiring a Hollywood film producer to construct a fake war with Albania. The scheme enlists the aid of a country music singer, who creates several theme songs for the war; a "fad king"; and a costume designer, who helps create a fictional special forces unit to fight the war's supposed battles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/Wag_The_Dog_Poster.jpg/225px-Wag_The_Dog_Poster.jpg
