1.00	Cobwork	Cob (material)	Cob, cobb or clom (in Wales) is a building material consisting of clay, sand, straw, water, and earth, similar to adobe. Cob is fireproof, resistant to seismic activity, and inexpensive. It can be used to create artistic, sculptural forms and has been revived in recent years by the natural building and sustainability movements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Cob_stitch_copy.jpg/220px-Cob_stitch_copy.jpg
