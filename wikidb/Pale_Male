35.04	Pale_Male	Pale Male	Pale Male (hatched 1990) is a well known New York City Red-tailed Hawk who has made his home since the early 1990s near Central Park. Birdwatcher and author Marie Winn gave him his name because of the unusually light coloring of his head. He is one of the first Red-tailed Hawks known to have nested on a building rather than in a tree and is famous for establishing a dynasty of urban-dwelling Red-tailed Hawks. Each spring birders set up telescopes at the Model Boat Pond to observe his nest and chicks at 927 Fifth Avenue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Palemale.jpg/200px-Palemale.jpg
