2.00	P_D_Q_Bach	P. D. Q. Bach	P. D. Q. Bach is a fictitious composer invented by musical satirist "Professor" Peter Schickele. In a gag that Schickele has developed over a five-decade-long career, he performs "discovered" works of this forgotten member of the Bach family. Schickele's music combines parodies of musicological scholarship, the conventions of Baroque and classical music, and slapstick comedy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Tromboon.jpg/110px-Tromboon.jpg
