6.02	Pentagon_tiling	Pentagon tiling	In geometry, a pentagon tiling is a tiling of the plane by pentagons. A regular pentagonal tiling on the Euclidean plane is impossible because the internal angle of a regular pentagon, 108, is not a divisor of 360. There are fourteen known types of convex pentagon that tile the plane; it is not known if this list is complete.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/PentagonTilings.svg/300px-PentagonTilings.svg.png
