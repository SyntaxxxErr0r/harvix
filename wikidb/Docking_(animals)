7.20	Docking_(animals)	Docking (animal)	Docking is a term for the intentional removal of part of an animal's tail or ears. The term cropping is also used, though more commonly in reference to the cropping of ears, while docking more commonly—but not exclusively—refers to the tail. The term tailing is also commonly used. The term arises because the living flesh of the tail, from which the animal's tail hairs grow, commonly is known as the dock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Two_lambs_rubber_ring_tail_docking%2C_cropped.jpg/300px-Two_lambs_rubber_ring_tail_docking%2C_cropped.jpg
