3.00	Khmer_New_Year	Cambodian New Year	Cambodian New Year (Khmer: ) or Chaul Chnam Thmey in the Khmer language, literally "Enter Year New", is the name of the Cambodian holiday that celebrates the New Year. The holiday lasts for three days beginning on New Year's day, which usually falls on April 13 or 14th, which is the end of the harvesting season, when farmers enjoy the fruits of their labor before the rainy season begins. Khmers living abroad may choose to celebrate during a weekend rather than just specifically April 13 through 15th. The Khmer New Year coincides with the traditional solar new year in several parts of India, Myanmar and Thailand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Khmer_New_Year_GA2010-146.jpg/250px-Khmer_New_Year_GA2010-146.jpg
