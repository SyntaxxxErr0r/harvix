1.10	Erzen	Erzen	The Erzen is a river in western Albania. Its source is in the mountains east of Tirana, near the village Shëngjergj. It flows west through Bërzhitë, Petrelë, Vaqarr, Ndroq, Shijak and Sukth. It flows into the Adriatic Sea near Sukth, north of Durrës. Apparently, all twenty-two victims of the 1951 massacre were dumped into the river on Enver Hoxha's orders, only to later be found wrapped tightly in barbed tape.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Albanian_Rivers.png/250px-Albanian_Rivers.png
