81.6	Crab	Crab	True crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting "tail" , or where the reduced abdomen is entirely hidden under the thorax. Many other animals with similar names – such as hermit crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs, horseshoe crabs and crab lice – are not true crabs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Liocarcinus_vernalis.jpg/220px-Liocarcinus_vernalis.jpg
