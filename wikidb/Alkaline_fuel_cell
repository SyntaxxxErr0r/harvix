NASA has used alkaline fuel cells since the mid-1960s, in Apollo-series missions and on the Space Shuttle. AFCs consume hydrogen and pure oxygen producing potable water, heat, and electricity. They are among the most efficient fuel cells, having the potential to reach 70%.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Alkalinecell.svg/270px-Alkalinecell.svg.png
