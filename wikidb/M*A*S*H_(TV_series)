160.1	M*A*S*H_(TV_series)	M*A*S*H (TV series)	M*A*S*H is an American television series developed by Larry Gelbart, adapted from the 1970 feature film MASH (which was itself based on the 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors, by Richard Hooker). The series is a medical drama/black comedy that was produced in association with 20th Century Fox Television for CBS. It follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the "4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital" in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War. M*A*S*H's title sequence featured an instrumental version of the song "Suicide Is Painless", which also appears in the original film. The show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, M*A*S*H Goes to Maine, failed. It is the most well known version of the M*A*S*H works.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/M%2AA%2AS%2AH_TV_title_screen.jpg/250px-M%2AA%2AS%2AH_TV_title_screen.jpg
