73.1	Joe_the_Plumber	Joe the Plumber	Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher (born December 3, 1973), better known by the nickname "Joe the Plumber", is an American conservative activist, commentator and politician. He gained instant national attention during the 2008 U.S. presidential election when, during a videotaped campaign stop in Ohio by then-Democratic candidate Barack Obama, Wurzelbacher asked Obama about his small business tax policy, and Obama gave a response that included the statement, "when you spread the wealth around, itâ€™s good for everybody." Obama's response was seized on by conservative commentators, as well as by Obama's rival, Republican candidate John McCain, as an indication that Obama was interested in wealth redistribution, and had a socialist view of the economy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Samuel_Joseph_Wurzelbacher.jpg/220px-Samuel_Joseph_Wurzelbacher.jpg
