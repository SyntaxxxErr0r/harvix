55.7	Siegfried_Sassoon	Siegfried Sassoon	Siegfried Loraine Sassoon, CBE MC (8 September 1886 â€“ 1 September 1967) was an English poet, author and soldier. Decorated for bravery on the Western Front, he became one of the leading poets of the First World War. His poetry both described the horrors of the trenches, and satirised the patriotic pretensions of those who, in Sassoon's view, were responsible for a vainglorious war. He later won acclaim for his prose work, notably his three-volume fictionalised autobiography, collectively known as the "Sherston Trilogy".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Siegfried_Sassoon_by_George_Charles_Beresford_%281915%29.jpg/220px-Siegfried_Sassoon_by_George_Charles_Beresford_%281915%29.jpg
