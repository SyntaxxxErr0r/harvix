1.00	Astra-phobia	Astraphobia	Astraphobia, also known as astrapophobia, brontophobia, keraunophobia, or tonitrophobia, is an abnormal fear of thunder and lightning, a type of specific phobia. It is a treatable phobia that both humans and animals can develop. The term astraphobia derives from the Greek words ἀστραπή (astrape; lightning) and φόβος (phobos; fear). In Sanskrit, the word "astra" means weapon, referring to the mythological demi god Indra who uses lightning as his weapon to bring fear to life on earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Lightning_NOAA.jpg/350px-Lightning_NOAA.jpg
