27.10	Ole_Kirk_Christiansen	Ole Kirk Christiansen	Ole Kirk Christiansen (7 April 1891 â€“ 11 March 1958) was the founder of Danish toy company the Lego Group. He was the 10th son of an impoverished family in Jutland in western Denmark. Born in Filskov, Denmark, he trained as a carpenter and started making wooden toys in 1932 to make a living after having lost his job during the depression. In 1942 a fire broke out at the factory forcing them to rebuild. Initially, he made miniature versions of the houses and furniture he worked on as a carpenter, but in 1947 moved onto using plastics. By 1949 he had produced over 200 plastic and wooden toys.
