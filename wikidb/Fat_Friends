4.10	Fat_Friends	Fat Friends	Fat Friends was an ITV drama (made by Tiger Aspect and Yorkshire Television), following a group of overweight people, their laughter and pain and addresses the absurdities of dieting in our modern age. The drama looks at people and how they relate to one another and use body weight as an excuse for all sorts of failings in their relationships, or not living their lives to the full. A later sitcom, Gavin &amp; Stacey used a very similar cast; Ruth Jones, James Corden and Alison Steadman appear as Vanessa 'Nessa' Jenkins, Neil 'Smithy' Smith and Pamela Shipman respectively.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Moor_Grange_4.jpg/220px-Moor_Grange_4.jpg
