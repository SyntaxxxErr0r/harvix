It tells the story of the overly protective clownfish Marlin who, along with a regal tang called Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), searches for his abducted son Nemo (Alexander Gould). Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and to let Nemo take care of himself. It is Pixar's first movie to be released in cinemas in the summer. The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It was the second highest-grossing film of 2003, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, earning a total of $868 million worldwide. Finding Nemo is also the best-selling DVD of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2006, and was the highest-grossing G-rated film of all time, before Pixar's own Toy Story 3 overtook it. It is also the fifth highest-grossing animated film of all time and the 26th highest-grossing film of all time. In 2008, the American Film Institute named it the 10th greatest animated film ever made during their Top 10.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1c/Nemo-poster2.jpg/220px-Nemo-poster2.jpg
