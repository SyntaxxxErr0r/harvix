1.00	Rhyme_%26_Reason_(film)	Rhyme &amp; Reason (film)	Rhyme &amp; Reason is a 1997 documentary film about rap and hip hop. Documentary filmmaker Peter Spirer interviewed over 80 significant artists in rap and hip hop music. This documentary explores the history of hip hop culture, how rap evolved to become a major cultural voice (and a multi-billion dollar industry), and what the artists have to say about the music's often controversial images and reputation. Interview subjects range from veteran old-school rappers, such as Kurtis Blow, KRS-One and Chuck D, to gangsta rap icons Ice-T, Dr. Dre, and MC Eiht, to several current rap hitmakers, including Wu-Tang Clan, The Fugees, and Sean "Puffy" Combs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Rhymeandreason.jpg/220px-Rhymeandreason.jpg
