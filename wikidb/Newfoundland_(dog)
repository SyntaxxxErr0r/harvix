They were originally bred and used as a working dog for fishermen in the Dominion of Newfoundland, now part of Canada. They are known for their giant size, tremendous strength, calm dispositions, and loyalty. Newfoundland dogs excel at water rescue/lifesaving due to their muscular build, thick double coat, webbed feet, and innate swimming abilities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Newfoundland_dog_Smoky.jpg/220px-Newfoundland_dog_Smoky.jpg
