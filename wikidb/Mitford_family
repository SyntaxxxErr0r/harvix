In the Middle Ages they had been Border Reivers based in Redesdale. The main family line had seats at Mitford Castle, Mitford Old Manor House and from 1828 the then-newly-built Mitford Hall. Several heads of the family served as High Sheriff of Northumberland.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/33/Mitford_family.jpg/250px-Mitford_family.jpg
