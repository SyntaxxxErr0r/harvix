3.31	Lane_High_School	Lane High School	Lane High School, in Charlottesville, Virginia, was a public secondary school serving residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County from 1940 until 1974. It was an all-white school until its court-ordered integration in 1959; black students attended Jackson P. Burley High School. It became too small to accommodate the student body, and was replaced by Charlottesville High School. In 1981, the building was converted for use as the Albemarle County Office Building, for which it remains in use today.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Albemarle_County_Office_Building.jpg/225px-Albemarle_County_Office_Building.jpg
