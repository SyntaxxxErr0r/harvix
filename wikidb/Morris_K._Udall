6.00	Morris_K._Udall	Mo Udall	Morris King "Mo" Udall (June 15, 1922 â€“ December 12, 1998) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative from Arizona from May 2, 1961 to May 4, 1991. A former professional basketball player with the old National Basketball League Denver Nuggets, noted for his liberal views, Mo Udall was a tall (6'5"), Lincolnesque figure with a self-deprecating wit and easy manner. Because of his wit, columnist James J. Kilpatrick deemed him "too funny to be president", which also ended up being the title of his autobiography in the 1980s. Udall earned a law degree from the University of Arizona in 1949. He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Morris_Udall.jpg/220px-Morris_Udall.jpg
