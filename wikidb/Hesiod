66.1	Hesiod	Hesiod	Hesiod ( or ; Greek: , Hēsíodos) was a Greek oral poet generally thought by scholars to have been active between 750 and 650 BC, around the same time as Homer. His is the first European poetry in which the poet regards himself as a topic, an individual with a distinctive role to play. Ancient authors credited him and Homer with establishing Greek religious customs. Modern scholars refer to him as a major source on Greek mythology, farming techniques, early economic thought (he is sometimes identified as the first economist), archaic Greek astronomy and ancient time-keeping.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/1807_Thorvaldsen_Tanz_der_Musen_auf_dem_Helikon_anagoria.JPG/400px-1807_Thorvaldsen_Tanz_der_Musen_auf_dem_Helikon_anagoria.JPG
