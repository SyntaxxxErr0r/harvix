83.9	Bhumibol_Adulyadej	Bhumibol Adulyadej	Although Bhumibol is legally a constitutional monarch, he has made several decisive interventions in the Thai political sphere. He was credited with facilitating Thailand's transition to democracy in the 1990s, although he has supported numerous military regimes, including Sarit Dhanarajata's during the 1960s and the Council for National Security in 2006â€“8. During his long reign, he has authorized over 15 coups, 16 constitutions, and 27 changes of prime ministers. He has also used his influence to stop military coups, including attempts in 1981 and 1985. Bhumibol is advised by a hand-picked Privy Council.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/King_Rama_IX_Signature.svg/125px-King_Rama_IX_Signature.svg.png
