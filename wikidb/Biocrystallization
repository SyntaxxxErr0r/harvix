1.20	Biocrystallization	Biocrystallization	Blood feeding organisms digest hemoglobin and release high quantities of free toxic heme. To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes heme to form hemozoin. To date, the only definitively characterized product of hematin disposal is the pigment hemozoin. Hemozoin is per definitionem not a mineral and therefore not formed by biomineralization. Heme biocrystallization has been found in blood feeding organisms of great medical importance including Plasmodium, Rhodnius and Schistosoma. Heme biocrystallization is inhibited by quinoline antimalarials such as Chloroquine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Chloroquine_3D.png/220px-Chloroquine_3D.png
