1.10	Veale_Gardens	Veale Gardens	Veale Gardens has been historically known as a homosexual meeting place for a number of years. There has been much debate over the years to either better police Veale Gardens or to close it during the evenings completely. Consequently, in late 2006 the public toilets were bulldozed and new toilets built on the South Terrace frontage. In 2007 the park entrance off Sir Lewis Cohen Avenue was closed and the street returned to park land to reduce late night parking.
