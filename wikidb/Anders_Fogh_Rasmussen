70.1	Anders_Fogh_Rasmussen	Anders Fogh Rasmussen	Anders Fogh Rasmussen was the leader of the Liberal Party , and headed a right-wing coalition with the Conservative People's Party which took office in 2001, and won its second and third terms in February 2005 and in November 2007. Rasmussen's government relied on the Danish People's Party for support, in keeping with the Danish tradition for minority government. His government introduced tougher limits on non-ECA immigration and froze tax rates before he took office (the "tax freeze", or skattestoppet in Danish). He has authored several books about taxation and government structure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Anders_Fogh_Rasmussen_-_World_Economic_Forum_Annual_Meeting_Davos_2008.jpg/220px-Anders_Fogh_Rasmussen_-_World_Economic_Forum_Annual_Meeting_Davos_2008.jpg
