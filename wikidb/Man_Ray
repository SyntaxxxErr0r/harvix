133.2	Man_Ray	Man Ray	Man Ray (August 27, 1890 â€“ November 18, 1976), born Emmanuel Radnitzky, was an American artist who spent most of his career in Paris, France. Perhaps best described simply as a modernist, he was a significant contributor to both the Dada and Surrealist movements, although his ties to each were informal. Best known in the art world for his avant-garde photography, Man Ray produced major works in a variety of media and considered himself a painter above all. He was also a renowned fashion and portrait photographer. He is noted for his photograms, which he renamed "Rayographs" after himself.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Man_Ray_1934.jpg/220px-Man_Ray_1934.jpg
