67.6	Fluorescent_lamp	Fluorescent lamp	A fluorescent lamp or fluorescent tube is a gas-discharge lamp that uses electricity to excite mercury vapor. The excited mercury atoms produce short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor to fluoresce, producing visible light. A fluorescent lamp converts electrical power into useful light more efficiently than an incandescent lamp. Lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost of the lamp. The lamp fixture is more costly because it requires a ballast to regulate the current through the lamp.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Fluorescent_lamps_artistic.jpg/220px-Fluorescent_lamps_artistic.jpg
