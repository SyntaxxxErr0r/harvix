10.31	Iron_(appliance)	Clothes iron	A Clothing iron, also referred to as simply an iron, is a small appliance - a handheld piece of equipment with a flat, triangular surface that, when heated, is used to press clothes in order to remove creases. The practice of using pressing clothes with this is generally called ironing. Ironing works by loosening the ties between the long chains of molecules that exist in polymer fiber materials. With the heat and the weight of the ironing plate, the fibers are stretched and the fabric maintains its new shape when cool. Some materials such as cotton require the use of water to loosen the intermolecular bonds. Many materials developed in the twentieth century are advertised as needing little or no ironing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Electric_steam_iron.jpg/220px-Electric_steam_iron.jpg
