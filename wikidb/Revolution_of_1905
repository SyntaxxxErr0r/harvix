Some of it was directed against the government, while some was undirected. It included worker strikes, peasant unrest, and military mutinies. It led to the establishment of limited constitutional monarchy, the State Duma of the Russian Empire, the multi-party system, and the Russian Constitution of 1906.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Bolshevik_bombs.jpg/300px-Bolshevik_bombs.jpg
