Situated between Nevada City and Grass Valley, the school serves those two incorporated cities and a large surrounding community. The Nevada Union High School district covers a huge geographic area with some students bussed in from as far as 55 miles away. NU was named a California Distinguished School in 1997 and in 1998 was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon High School. NUHS serves ninth through twelfth grade students, with a current enrollment of 2,701 students. NUHS does not have an ethnically diverse student population, as 92.4% are Caucasian. It is, however, economically diverse with 6% of families qualifying for the Free and Reduced National School Lunch Program.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/Nevada_Union_High_School_Logo.jpg
