7.31	Tulsa_Oilers	Tulsa Oilers	The Tulsa Oilers are a professional ice hockey team in the Central Hockey League. The Oilers played their home games at the Maxwell Center (also known as Tulsa Convention Center) until 2008, when they moved into the new BOK Center. For many years, the Tulsa Oilers name was shared with Tulsa's former minor-league baseball team that pre-dated the Tulsa Drillers. To reduce confusion in local news reporting, the hockey team was often called the "Ice Oilers", a moniker that continues to this day among many Tulsans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/TulsaOilers.PNG/200px-TulsaOilers.PNG
