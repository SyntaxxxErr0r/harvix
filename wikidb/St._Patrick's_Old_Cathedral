Built between 1809 and 1815, and designed by Joseph-Fran√ßois Mangin in the Gothic Revival style, it was the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York until the current Saint Patrick's Cathedral opened in 1879. Liturgies are celebrated in English and Spanish.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Saint_Pats_Old_Cathedral_Manh_jeh.JPG/250px-Saint_Pats_Old_Cathedral_Manh_jeh.JPG
