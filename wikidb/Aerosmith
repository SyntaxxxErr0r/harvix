Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with singer Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Aerosmith2007.jpg/250px-Aerosmith2007.jpg
