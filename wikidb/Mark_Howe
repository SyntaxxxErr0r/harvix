He is the son of Colleen and Gordie Howe, and early in his career was a teammate of his father.

He is a member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame and part of the 2011 induction class of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. He is currently the Director of Pro Scouting for the Detroit Red Wings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Mark_Howe.jpg/220px-Mark_Howe.jpg
