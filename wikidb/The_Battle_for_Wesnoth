7.44	The_Battle_for_Wesnoth	The Battle for Wesnoth	The Battle for Wesnoth, or simply Wesnoth, is a turn-based strategy game with a fantasy setting, designed by David White and first released in June 2003. In Wesnoth, the player attempts to build a powerful army by controlling villages and defeating enemies for experience. White based Wesnoth loosely on the Sega Genesis games Master of Monsters and Warsong. He wanted to create a freely-available, open source strategy game with very simple rules, but one that had strong artificial intelligence and that was challenging and fun.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Battle_for_Wesnoth_logo.png/250px-Battle_for_Wesnoth_logo.png
