16.20	At_Ease	At Ease	At Ease was an alternative to the Macintosh desktop developed by Apple Computer in the early 1990s. It provided a simple environment for new Macintosh users and young children to help them to work without supervision. At Ease sits on top of the Finder desktop, providing a simple tab panel oriented graphical user interface in which applications and documents are represented by icons on large buttons. Aside from its security features, its interface and basic functionality is very similar to the Packard Bell Navigator.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/Ateaseuserfolder.png/250px-Ateaseuserfolder.png
