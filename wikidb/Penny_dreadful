54.9	Penny_dreadful	Penny dreadful	A penny dreadful (also called penny horrible, penny awful, penny number and penny bloodn 1) was a type of British fiction publication in the 19th century that usually featured lurid serial stories appearing in parts over a number of weeks, each part costing an (old) penny. The term, however, soon came to encompass a variety of publications that featured cheap sensational fiction, such as story papers and booklet "libraries". The penny dreadfuls were printed on cheap pulp paper and were aimed primarily at working class adolescents.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Pennydreadful.png/220px-Pennydreadful.png
