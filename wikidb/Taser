78.0	Taser	Taser	A Taser is an electroshock weapon that uses electrical current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles. Created and marketed by Taser International, the name "TASER" is both a brand and a registered trademark of Taser International. The device functions by effecting "neuromuscular incapacitation" and the devices' mechanism "Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology". Someone struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscle contractions. Tasers do not rely only on pain compliance, except when used in Drive Stun mode, and are thus preferred by some law enforcement over non-Taser stun guns and other electronic control weapons. At the present time, there are two main police models, the M26 and X26. Both come with various accessories, including a laser sight and optional mounted digital video camera that can record in low-light situations. Taser International is also marketing a civilian model called the C2. On 27 July 2009, Taser introduced the X3, capable of firing three times without reload.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Taser-x26.jpg/220px-Taser-x26.jpg
