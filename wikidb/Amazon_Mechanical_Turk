138.1	Amazon_Mechanical_Turk	Amazon Mechanical Turk	The Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace that enables computer programmers (known as Requesters) to co-ordinate the use of human intelligence to perform tasks that computers are unable to do yet. It is one of the suites of Amazon Web Services. The Requesters are able to post tasks known as HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks), such as choosing the best among several photographs of a store-front, writing product descriptions, or identifying performers on music CDs. Workers (called Providers in Mechanical Turk's Terms of Service) can then browse among existing tasks and complete them for a monetary payment set by the Requester. To place HITs, the requesting programs use an open Application Programming Interface, or the more limited MTurk Requester site. Requestors are restricted to US-based entities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/AWS_Simple_Icons_On-Demand_Workforce_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk_Workers.svg/220px-AWS_Simple_Icons_On-Demand_Workforce_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk_Workers.svg.png
