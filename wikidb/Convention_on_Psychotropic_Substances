21.27	Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances	Convention on Psychotropic Substances	The Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 is a United Nations treaty designed to control psychoactive drugs such as amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and psychedelics signed at Vienna on February 21, 1971. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 could not ban the many newly discovered psychotropics, since its scope was limited to drugs with cannabis-, coca-, and opium-like effects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Ecstacy_monogram.jpg/220px-Ecstacy_monogram.jpg
