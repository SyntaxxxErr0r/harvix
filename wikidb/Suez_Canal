114.3	Suez_Canal	Suez Canal	The Suez Canal , also known by the nickname "The Highway to India", is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work, it allows transportation by water between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa. The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfik at the city of Suez. Ismailia lies on its west bank, 3 km (1.9 mi) north of the half-way point.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/SuezCanal-EO.JPG/180px-SuezCanal-EO.JPG
