58.1	Root_nameserver	Root name server	A root name server is a name server for the Domain Name System's root zone. It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests returning a list of the designated authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain (TLD). The root name servers are a critical part of the Internet because they are the first step in translating human readable host names into IP addresses that are used in communication between Internet hosts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Ams-ix.k.root-servers.net.jpg/290px-Ams-ix.k.root-servers.net.jpg
