Disaster recovery is a subset of business continuity. While business continuity involves planning for keeping all aspects of a business functioning in the midst of disruptive events, disaster recovery focuses on the IT or technology systems that support business functions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/FEMA_-_43564_-_Mobile_Disaster_Recovery_Center.jpg/180px-FEMA_-_43564_-_Mobile_Disaster_Recovery_Center.jpg
