58.9	Fluid_dynamics	Fluid dynamics	In physics, fluid dynamics is a sub-discipline of fluid mechanics that deals with fluid flowâ€”the natural science of fluids in motion. It has several subdisciplines itself, including aerodynamics (the study of air and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of liquids in motion). Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting weather patterns, understanding nebulae in interstellar space and reportedly modeling fission weapon detonation. Some of its principles are even used in traffic engineering, where traffic is treated as a continuous fluid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg/220px-BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg.png
