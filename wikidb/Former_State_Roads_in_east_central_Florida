Many of the following were "tagged" as secondary or county roads by Florida Department of Transportation, but several were removed from the State Road list and transferred to county control and maintenance without such an addition of a tag onto the road signs. Most of the decommissionings occurred in sparsely-populated areas, including orange groves and wetlands that are the headwaters of Saint Johns River, and two counties - St. Lucie and Indian River - were particularly affected by the wave of decommissionings.
