1.12	Richmond_Tigers	Richmond Football Club	The Richmond Football Club, nicknamed The Tigers, is an Australian rules football club which competes in the Australian Football League. Richmond shares healthy rivalries with Carlton, Collingwood and Essendon. After winning five premierships between 1967 and 1980, the club hit the depths in 1990, when a large debt almost forced them to fold. In the last 15 years, Richmond regained a strong financial position without enjoying any sustained finals success. Nonetheless the Tigers boast a mighty history (ten premierships) and a host of star players and personalities who have contributed to the formation of the unique Richmond football identity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/New_Richmond_Logo.jpg/150px-New_Richmond_Logo.jpg
