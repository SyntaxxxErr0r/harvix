89.6	Ada_(programming_language)	Ada (programming language)	Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative, wide-spectrum, and object-oriented high-level computer programming language, extended from Pascal and other languages. It has strong built-in language support for explicit concurrency, offering tasks, synchronous message passing (via guarded task entries), protected objects (a monitor-like construct with additional guards as in conditional critical regions), and nondeterminism (via select statements).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Ada_Lovelace_1838.jpg/157px-Ada_Lovelace_1838.jpg
