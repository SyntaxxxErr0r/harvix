90.2	Colonialism	Colonialism	Colonialism is the establishment, maintenance, acquisition and expansion of colonies in one territory by people from another territory. It is a process whereby the metropole claims sovereignty over the colony, and the social structure, government, and economics of the colony are changed by colonizers from the metropole. Colonialism is a set of unequal relationships between the metropole and the colony and between the colonists and the indigenous population.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Musee-de-lArmee-IMG_0976.jpg/220px-Musee-de-lArmee-IMG_0976.jpg
