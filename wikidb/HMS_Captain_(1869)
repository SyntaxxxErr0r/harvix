4.00	HMS_Captain_(1869)	HMS Captain (1869)	HMS Captain was an unsuccessful warship built for the Royal Navy due to public pressure. She was a masted turret ship, designed and built by a private contractor against the wishes of the Controller's department. The Captain was completed in April 1870 and capsized in September 1870 with the loss of nearly 500 lives because of design and construction errors that led to inadequate stability.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/HMS_captainWilliam_Frederick_Mitchell.jpg/300px-HMS_captainWilliam_Frederick_Mitchell.jpg
