127.7	Karlheinz_Stockhausen	Karlheinz Stockhausen	Karlheinz Stockhausen (German pronunciation: ; 22 August 1928 â€“ 5 December 2007) was a German composer, widely acknowledged by critics as one of the most important (Barrett 1988, 45; Harvey 1975b, 705; Hopkins 1972, 33; Klein 1968, 117) but also controversial (Power 1990, 30) composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. Another critic calls him "one of the great visionaries of 20th-century music" (Hewett 2007). He is known for his ground-breaking work in electronic music, aleatory (controlled chance) in serial composition, and musical spatialization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Stockhausen_1994_WDR.jpg/300px-Stockhausen_1994_WDR.jpg
