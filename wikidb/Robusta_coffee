Though widely known as Coffea robusta, the plant is scientifically identified as Coffea canephora, which has two main varieties - Robusta and Nganda. It is mostly grown in Vietnam, where French colonists introduced it in the late 19th century, and also in Africa and Brazil, where it is often called conillon. Approximately 20% of the coffee produced in the world is robusta.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Coffea_canephora_berries.JPG/220px-Coffea_canephora_berries.JPG
