2.00	Birmingham_Snow_Hill	Birmingham Snow Hill station	Birmingham Snow Hill is a railway station and tram stop in the centre of Birmingham, England, on the site of an earlier, much larger station built by the former Great Western Railway (GWR). Until recently it was the second most important railway station in the city, after Birmingham New Street station; but, after its renovation and changes to services, Birmingham Moor Street (in terms of passenger usage and facilities) is now Birmingham's second main central station.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Snow_Hill_station.jpg/265px-Snow_Hill_station.jpg
