56.4	Necrosis	Necrosis	Necrosis (from the Greek νεκρός, "dead", νέκρωσις, "death, the stage of dying, the act of killing") is the premature death of cells in living tissue. Necrosis is caused by factors external to the cell or tissue, such as infection, toxins, or trauma. This is in contrast to apoptosis, which is a naturally occurring cause of cellular death. While apoptosis often provides beneficial effects to the organism, necrosis is almost always detrimental and can be fatal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Necrotic_leg_wound.png/220px-Necrotic_leg_wound.png
