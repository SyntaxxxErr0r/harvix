Historically, paper or cardboard punched cards were used throughout the first several decades of the computer industry to store information and programs for computer system, and were read by punched card readers. More modern card readers are electronic devices that use plastic cards imprinted with barcodes, magnetic strips, computer chips or other storage medium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Gnome-dev-smartcard.svg/120px-Gnome-dev-smartcard.svg.png
