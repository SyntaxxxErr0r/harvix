1.00	Wicking_fabric	Layered clothing	Layered clothing is a manner of dressing using multiple garments that are worn on top of each other. Some of the layers have different, largely non-overlapping, functions. Using more or fewer layers, or replacing one layer but not others, allows for flexible clothing to match the needs of each situation. Two thin layers can be warmer yet lighter than one thick layer, because the air trapped between layers serves as thermal insulation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Hard-shell-jacket.jpg/220px-Hard-shell-jacket.jpg
