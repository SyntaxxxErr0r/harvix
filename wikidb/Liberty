95.1	Liberty	Liberty	Liberty is a contested moral and political principle that seeks to identify the condition in which human beings are able to govern themselves. There are different conceptions of liberty, which articulate the relationship of individuals to society in different ways, including some which relate to life under a "social contract" or to existence in a "state of nature", and some which see the active exercise of freedom and rights as essential to liberty. Understanding liberty involves how we imagine the roles and responsibilities of the individual in society in relationship to conceptions of free will and determinism, which involves the larger domain of metaphysics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9b/John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg/145px-John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg
