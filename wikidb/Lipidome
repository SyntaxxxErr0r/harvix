2.00	Lipidome	Lipidome	The lipidome refers to the totality of lipids in cells. Lipids are one of the four major molecular components of biological organisms, along with proteins, sugars and nucleic acids. Lipidome is a term coined in the context of omics in modern biology, within the field of lipidomics. It can be studied using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics as well as traditional lab-based methods. The lipidome of a cell can be subdivided into the membrane-lipidome and mediator-lipidome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/98/Metabolomics_schema.png/350px-Metabolomics_schema.png
