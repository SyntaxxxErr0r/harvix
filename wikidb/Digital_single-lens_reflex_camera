168.7	Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera	Digital single-lens reflex camera	Digital single-lens reflex cameras (also named digital SLR or DSLR) are digital cameras combining the parts of a single-lens reflex camera (SLR) and a digital camera back, replacing the photographic film. The first DSLRs were constructed this way, later features like live preview, HD video recording with contrast detection autofocus or ergonomic integration like dedicated film speed (ISO) buttons took further advantage of the digital image sensor. Although the term DSLR often refers to cameras that resemble 35 mm format cameras, some medium format cameras are also DSLRs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Nikon_D3S_img_3543.jpg/220px-Nikon_D3S_img_3543.jpg
