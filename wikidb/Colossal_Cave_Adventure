114.7	Colossal_Cave_Adventure	Colossal Cave Adventure	Colossal Cave Adventure (also known as ADVENT, Colossal Cave, or Adventure) gave its name to the computer adventure game genre. It was originally designed by Will Crowther, a programmer and caving enthusiast who based the layout on part of the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky. The Colossal Cave subnetwork has many entrances, one of which is known as Bedquilt. Crowther reproduced portions of the real cave so faithfully that cavers who have played the game can easily navigate through familiar sections in the Bedquilt region on their first visit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/ADVENT_--_Will_Crowther%27s_original_version.png/256px-ADVENT_--_Will_Crowther%27s_original_version.png
