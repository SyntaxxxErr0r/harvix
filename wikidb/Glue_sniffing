1.00	Glue_sniffing	Inhalant abuse	Inhalants are a broad range of drugs whose volatile vapors are taken in via the nose and trachea. They are taken by volatilization, and do not include drugs that are inhaled after burning or heating. For example, amyl nitrite and toluene are considered inhalants, but tobacco, marijuana, and crack are not.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Canned-air.jpg/220px-Canned-air.jpg
