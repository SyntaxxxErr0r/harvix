1.00	Self-publication	Self-publishing	The term 'vanity publishing' is mostly obsolete today as a company contracting with an author to assist with the production of a book is considered 'self-publishing', not vanity publishing. The author may engage a company that offers services—usually designed as publishing packages including editing, marketing, design, etc.—and outsource all or part of the process to these companies.
