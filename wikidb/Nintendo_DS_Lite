56.6	Nintendo_DS_Lite	Nintendo DS Lite	The Nintendo DS Lite Nintendō Dī Esu Raito) is a dual-screen handheld game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It is a slimmer, brighter, and more lightweight redesign of the old Nintendo DS, designed to be aesthetically sleeker, while taking styling cues from the Game Boy Advance SP, and to appeal to broader commercial audiences. It was announced on January 26, 2006, more than a month before its initial release in Japan on March 2, 2006 due to overwhelming demand for the original model. It has been released in Australia, North America, Europe, New Zealand, Singapore, and defined regions in South America, the Middle East, and East Asia. As of December 31, 2009, shipments of the DS Lite have reached 89.19 million units worldwide, according to Nintendo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Nintendo_DS_Lite_logo.svg/250px-Nintendo_DS_Lite_logo.svg.png
