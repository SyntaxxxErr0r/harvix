51.4	Boolean_algebra_(logic)	Boolean algebra (logic)	Boolean algebra (or Boolean logic) is a logical calculus of truth values, developed by George Boole in the 1840s. It resembles the algebra of real numbers, but with the numeric operations of multiplication xy, addition x + y, and negation −x replaced by the respective logical operations of conjunction x∧y, disjunction x∨y, and negation ¬x. The Boolean operations are these and all other operations that can be built from these, such as x∧ . These turn out to coincide with the set of all operations on the set {0,1} that take only finitely many arguments; there are 2 such operations when there are n arguments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Baops.gif/450px-Baops.gif
