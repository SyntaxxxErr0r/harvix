154.6	Copyright_infringement	Copyright infringement	Copyright infringement is the unauthorized use of works under copyright, infringing the copyright holder's "exclusive rights", such as the right to reproduce or perform the copyrighted work, spread the information contained within copyrighted works, or to make derivative works. It often refers to copying "intellectual property" without written permission from the copyright holder, which is typically a publisher or other business representing or assigned by the work's creator.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Copyrightpirates.jpg/220px-Copyrightpirates.jpg
