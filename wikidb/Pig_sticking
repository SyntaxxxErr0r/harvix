1.00	Pig_sticking	Boar hunting	Boar hunting is generally the practice of hunting wild boars, but can also extend to feral pigs and peccaries. A full-sized boar is a large animal armed with sharp tusks which it uses to defend itself. Boar hunting has often been a test of bravery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Wild_boar_tusks.jpg/200px-Wild_boar_tusks.jpg
