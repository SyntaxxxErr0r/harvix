7.40	Corneal_neovascularization	Corneal neovascularization	Corneal neovascularization is the excessive ingrowth of blood vessels from the limbal vascular plexus into the cornea, caused by a low reception of oxygen, which is generally not received from the bloodstream, but through the air. One of the most common causes is contact lens wear, and to a greater extent, continued use of extended wear contacts. The condition could threaten one's eyesight in the elevated stages, which is one of the primary reasons eye care physicians strongly recommend routine (annual) exams for contact lens patients.
