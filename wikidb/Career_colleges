1.00	Career_colleges	Vocational school	A vocational school (or trade school or career school), providing vocational education, is a school in which students are taught the skills needed to perform a particular job. Traditionally, vocational schools have not existed to further education in the sense of liberal arts, but rather to teach only job-specific skills, and as such have been better considered to be institutions devoted to training, not education. That purely vocational focus began changing in the 1990s "toward a broader preparation that develops the academic" and technical skills of students, as well as the vocational.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Uetersen_Finkenbrook.jpg/220px-Uetersen_Finkenbrook.jpg
