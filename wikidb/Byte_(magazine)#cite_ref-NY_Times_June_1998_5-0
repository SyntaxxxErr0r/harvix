1.00	Byte_(magazine)#cite_ref-NY_Times_June_1998_5-0	Byte (magazine)	BYTE magazine was a microcomputer magazine, influential in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s because of its wide-ranging editorial coverage. Whereas many magazines from the mid-1980s had been dedicated to the MS-DOS (PC) platform or the Mac, mostly from a business or home user's perspective, Byte covered developments in the entire field of "small computers and software", and sometimes other computing fields such as supercomputers and high-reliability computing. Coverage was in-depth with much technical detail, rather than user-oriented. The Byte name and logo continued to exist as of 2011 , but as an online publication only, with different emphasis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Byte_Front_Cover_December_1975.jpg/200px-Byte_Front_Cover_December_1975.jpg
