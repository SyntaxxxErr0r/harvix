292.6	AIDS	AIDS	Acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is a disease of the human immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The illness interferes with the immune system, making people with AIDS much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not affect people with working immune systems. This susceptibility gets worse as the disease continues.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Red_Ribbon.svg/120px-Red_Ribbon.svg.png
