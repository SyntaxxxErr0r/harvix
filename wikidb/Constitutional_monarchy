76.7	Constitutional_monarchy	Constitutional monarchy	Constitutional monarchy (or limited monarchy) is a form of government in which a monarch acts as head of state within the parameters of a constitution, whether it be a written, uncodified, or blended constitution. This form of government differs from absolute monarchy in which an absolute monarch serves as the source of power in the state and is not legally bound by any constitution and has the powers to regulate his or her respective government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Heraldic_Royal_Crown_%28Common%29.svg/100px-Heraldic_Royal_Crown_%28Common%29.svg.png
