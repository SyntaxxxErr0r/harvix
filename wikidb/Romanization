55.1	Romanization	Romanization	In linguistics, romanization or latinization is the representation of a written word or spoken speech with the Roman (Latin) script, or a system for doing so, where the original word or language uses a different writing system (or none). Methods of romanization include transliteration, for representing written text, and transcription, for representing the spoken word. The latter can be subdivided into phonemic transcription, which records the phonemes or units of semantic meaning in speech, and more strict phonetic transcription, which records speech sounds with precision. Each romanization has its own set of rules for pronunciation of the romanized words.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Gwoyu.svg/150px-Gwoyu.svg.png
