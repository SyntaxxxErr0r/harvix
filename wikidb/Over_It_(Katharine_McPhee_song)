1.00	Over_It_(Katharine_McPhee_song)	Over It (Katharine McPhee song)	"Over It" is the first single released from the eponymous album by Katharine McPhee, the American Idol season five (2006) finalist. The song was reportedly described by McPhee as "the only real pop song on the record" and as being "a very sultry song about young love". The song was produced by Billy Steinberg and Josh Alexander, and written by Alexander, Steinberg and Ruth-Anne Cunningham, the writers of JoJo's "Too Little Too Late". The song is available for listening via online music services such as AOL and MySpace, courtesy of RCA Records. McPhee has since stated that this was not " favorite song" and she did not want her "song to be something that was a part of."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/OverItKMPcover.jpg/220px-OverItKMPcover.jpg
