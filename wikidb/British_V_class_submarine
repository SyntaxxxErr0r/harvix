1.00	British_V_class_submarine	British V class submarine	The British V class submarine (officially "U-Class Long hull 1941â€“42 program") was a class of submarines built for the Royal Navy during World War II. 42 vessels were ordered to this design, all to be built by Vickers-Armstrong at either Barrow-in-Furness or at Walker-on-Tyne, but only 22 were completed. Note that 7 of these vessels received 'U' names (conversely, 4 of the 'U' class had received names beginning with 'V').	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/HMS_Venturer_%28P68%29_%28IWM_FL_004031%29.jpg/300px-HMS_Venturer_%28P68%29_%28IWM_FL_004031%29.jpg
