1.00	Apotropaeus	Apollo	Apollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: , Apollōn (gen.: ); Doric: , Apellōn; Arcadocypriot: , Apeilōn; Aeolic: , Aploun; Latin: ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in ancient Greek and Roman religion, Greco–Roman Neopaganism, and Greek and Roman mythology. The ideal of the kouros (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of light and the sun, truth and prophecy, healing, plague, music, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Belvedere_Apollo_Pio-Clementino_Inv1015.jpg/200px-Belvedere_Apollo_Pio-Clementino_Inv1015.jpg
