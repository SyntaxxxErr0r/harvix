10.20	Rate-capping_rebellion	Rate-capping rebellion	Until 1989 in Scotland and 1990 in England and Wales, local councils raised their own revenue through a tax known as rates. Every property, whether residential or commercial, was given a rateable value which estimated the annual rent it would bring in. In the budgeting process the council would work out the total amount it needed to raise locally, and then divide it by the total rateable value within its boundaries to produce the proportion of the rateable value that each householder or business would have to pay. This proportion was known as 'the rate' for the year and the process was therefore known as 'setting a rate'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Liverpool_Town_Hall.JPG/220px-Liverpool_Town_Hall.JPG
