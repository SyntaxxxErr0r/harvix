Following the occupation of Madrid on March 23, 1808, C치diz became the Spanish seat of power, and was targeted by 70,000 French troops under the command of the Marshals Claude Victor and Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult for one of the most important sieges of the war. Defending the city were 2,000 Spanish troops who, as the siege progressed, received aid from 10,000 Spanish reinforcements as well as British and Portuguese troops.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/SitiodeCadiz.jpg/300px-SitiodeCadiz.jpg
