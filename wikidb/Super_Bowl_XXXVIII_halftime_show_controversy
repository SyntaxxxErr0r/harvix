80.7	Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy	Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy	Super Bowl XXXVIII, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004 from Houston, Texas on the CBS television network in the United States, was noted for a controversial halftime show in which Janet Jackson's breast, adorned with a nipple shield, was exposed by Justin Timberlake for about half a second, in what was later referred to as a "wardrobe malfunction". The incident, sometimes referred to as Nipplegate, was widely discussed. Along with the rest of the halftime show, it led to an immediate crackdown and widespread debate on perceived indecency in broadcasting. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined a record $550,000 against CBS, but the case was brought to court and the fine definitely voided by the 2011 ruling.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8d/Janet_Jackson_%26_Justin_Timberlake%27s_wardrobe_malfunction.jpg/220px-Janet_Jackson_%26_Justin_Timberlake%27s_wardrobe_malfunction.jpg
