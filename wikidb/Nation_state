59.9	Nation_state	Nation state	The nation state is a state that self-identifies as deriving its political legitimacy from serving as a sovereign entity for a nation as a sovereign territorial unit. The state is a political and geopolitical entity; the nation is a cultural and/or ethnic entity. The term "nation state" implies that the two geographically coincide. Nation state formation took place at different times in different parts of the earth but has become the dominant form of state organization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/The_Ratification_of_the_Treaty_of_Munster%2C_Gerard_Ter_Borch_%281648%29.jpg/250px-The_Ratification_of_the_Treaty_of_Munster%2C_Gerard_Ter_Borch_%281648%29.jpg
