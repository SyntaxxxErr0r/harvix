2.00	Ion_channel_pore	Ion channel	Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that help establish and control the voltage gradient across the plasma membrane of cells (see cell potential) by allowing the flow of ions down their electrochemical gradient. They are present in the membranes that surround all biological cells. The study of ion channels involves many scientific techniques such as voltage clamp electrophysiology (in particular patch clamp), immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Ion_channel.png/350px-Ion_channel.png
