54.6	Mercury_(mythology)	Mercury (mythology)	Mercury (Latin: Mercurius Â·)) was a messenger who wore winged sandals, and a god of trade, thieves, and travel, the son of Maia Maiestas and Jupiter in Roman mythology. His name is related to the Latin word merx ("merchandise"; compare merchant, commerce, etc.), mercari , and merces (wages). In his earliest forms, he appears to have been related to the Etruscan deity Turms, but most of his characteristics and mythology were borrowed from the analogous Greek god, Hermes. Latin writers rewrote Hermes' myths and substituted his name with that of Mercury. However, there are at least two myths that involve Mercury that are Roman in origin. In Virgil's Aeneid, Mercury reminds Aeneas of his mission to found the city of Rome. In Ovid's Fasti, Mercury is assigned to escort the nymph Larunda to the underworld. Mercury, however, fell in love with Larunda and made love to her on the way; this act has also been interpreted as a rape. Larunda thereby became mother to two children, referred to as the Lares, invisible household gods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/P1030419_-_Copie_%282%29.JPG/200px-P1030419_-_Copie_%282%29.JPG
