1.00	Danish_butter_cookie	Butter cookie	Butter cookies (or butter biscuits), known as Brysslkex, Sabl√©s, and Danish biscuits, are unleavened cookies consisting of butter, flour, and sugar. They are often categorized as a "crisp cookie" due to their texture, caused in part because of the quantity of butter and sugar. It is generally necessary to chill the dough to enable proper manipulation and handling. Butter cookies at their most basic have no flavoring, but they are often flavored with vanilla, chocolate, and coconut, and/or topped with sugar crystals. They also come in a variety of shapes such as circles, squares, ovals, rings, and pretzel-like forms, and with a variety of appearances, including marbled, checkered or plain. In some parts of the world such as European countries and North America these are often served around Christmas time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Butter_cookies.jpg/250px-Butter_cookies.jpg
