55.7	The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire	The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire	The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is a non-fiction history book written by English historian Edward Gibbon and published in six volumes. Volume I was published in 1776, and went through six printings. Volumes II and III were published in 1781; volumes IV, V, VI in 1788â€“89. The original volumes were published in quarto sections, a common publishing practice of the time. The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources, at the time, its methodology became a model for later historians. This led to Gibbon being called the first "modern historian of ancient Rome."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Edward_Gibbon_by_Henry_Walton_cleaned.jpg/222px-Edward_Gibbon_by_Henry_Walton_cleaned.jpg
