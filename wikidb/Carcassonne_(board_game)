102.2	Carcassonne_(board_game)	Carcassonne (board game)	Carcassonne is a tile-based German-style board game for two to five players, designed by Klaus-Jürgen Wrede and published in 2000 by Hans im Glück in German and Rio Grande Games in English. It received the Spiel des Jahres and the Deutscher Spiele Preis awards in 2001. It is named after the medieval fortified town of Carcassonne in southern France, famed for its city walls. The game has spawned many expansions and spin-offs, and several PC and console versions. The game's wooden follower pieces, colloquially called "meeples," have become a symbol of European board gaming.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Carcassonne-game.jpg/150px-Carcassonne-game.jpg
