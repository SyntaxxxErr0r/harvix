56.6	Backmasking	Backmasking	Backmasking (also known as backward masking) is a recording technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward on to a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through phonetic reversal may be unintentional.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Reel-to-reel_recorder_tc-630.jpg/220px-Reel-to-reel_recorder_tc-630.jpg
