54.3	Mantua	Mantua	Mantua is surrounded on three sides by artificial lakes created during the 12th century. These receive the waters of the river Mincio, a tributary of the Po which descends from Lake Garda. The three lakes are called Lago Superiore, Lago di Mezzo, and Lago Inferiore ("Upper", "Middle", and "Lower Lake"). A fourth lake, Lake Pajolo, which once completed a defensive water ring of the city, dried up at the end of the 18th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Mantova_Skyline.jpg/250px-Mantova_Skyline.jpg
