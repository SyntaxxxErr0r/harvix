2.10	Robert_Burnell	Robert Burnell	Robert Burnell (sometimes Robert Burnel) (circa 1239 – 25 October 1292) was an English bishop who served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1274 to 1292. A native of Shropshire, he served as a minor royal official before entering into the service of Prince Edward, the future King Edward I of England. When Edward went on the Eighth Crusade in 1270, Burnell stayed in England to secure the prince's interests. He served as regent after the death of King Henry III of England while Edward was still on crusade. He was twice elected Archbishop of Canterbury, but his personal life—which included a long-term mistress who was rumoured to have borne him four sons—prevented his confirmation by the papacy. In 1275 Burnell was elected Bishop of Bath and Wells, after Edward had appointed him Lord Chancellor in 1274.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/ActonBurnellCastlec.jpg/250px-ActonBurnellCastlec.jpg
