59.2	Glockenspiel	Glockenspiel	A glockenspiel (German pronunciation: , glocken:bells and spiel:play) is a percussion instrument composed of a set of tuned keys arranged in the fashion of the keyboard of a piano. In this way, it is similar to the xylophone; however, the xylophone's bars are made of wood, while the glockenspiel's are metal plates or tubes, thus making it a metallophone. The glockenspiel, moreover, is usually smaller and higher in pitch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Glockenspiel.jpg/250px-Glockenspiel.jpg
