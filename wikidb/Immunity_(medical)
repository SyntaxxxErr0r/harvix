34.90	Immunity_(medical)	Immunity (medical)	A further subdivision of adaptive immunity is characterized by the cells involved; humoral immunity is the aspect of immunity that is mediated by secreted antibodies, whereas the protection provided by cell mediated immunity involves T-lymphocytes alone. Humoral immunity is active when the organism generates its own antibodies, and passive when antibodies are transferred between individuals. Similarly, cell mediated immunity is active when the organismsâ€™ own T-cells are stimulated and passive when T cells come from another organism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Immunity.png/600px-Immunity.png
