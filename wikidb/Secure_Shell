324.2	Secure_Shell	Secure Shell	In 1999, developers wanting a free software version to be available went back to the older 1.2.12 release of the original SSH program, which was the last released under an open source license. Björn Grönvall's OSSH was subsequently developed from this codebase. Shortly thereafter, OpenBSD developers forked Grönvall's code and did extensive work on it, creating OpenSSH, which shipped with the 2.6 release of OpenBSD. From this version, a "portability" branch was formed to port OpenSSH to other operating systems. As of 2005 , OpenSSH was the single most popular SSH implementation, coming by default in a large number of operating systems. OSSH meanwhile has become obsolete. OpenSSH continued to be maintained and now supports both 1.x and 2.0 versions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/X11_ssh_tunnelling.png/250px-X11_ssh_tunnelling.png
