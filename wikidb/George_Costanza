124.2	George_Costanza	George Costanza	George Louis Costanza is a character in the American television sitcom Seinfeld (1989â€“1998), played by Jason Alexander. He has variously been described as a "short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man" (by Elaine Benes and Costanza himself), "Lord of the Idiots" (by Costanza himself), and as "the greatest sitcom character of all time". He is friends with Jerry Seinfeld, Cosmo Kramer, and Elaine Benes. George appears in every episode except for "The Pen" (third season). The character was originally based on Seinfeld co-creator Larry David, but surnamed after Jerry Seinfeld's real-life New York friend, Mike Costanza.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/70/George_Costanza.jpg/246px-George_Costanza.jpg
