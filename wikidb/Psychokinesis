63.4	Psychokinesis	Psychokinesis	Psychokinesis (from the Greek ψυχή, "psyche", meaning mind, soul, heart, or breath; and κίνησις, "kinesis", meaning motion, movement; literally "mind-movement"), also referred to as telekinesis (Greek + , literally "distant-movement") with respect to strictly describing movement of matter, sometimes abbreviated PK and TK respectively, is a term coined by publisher Henry Holt to refer to the direct influence of mind on a physical system that cannot be entirely accounted for by the mediation of any known physical energy (i.e. moving objects with the mind). Examples of psychokinesis could include distorting or moving an object, and influencing the output of a random number generator.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Medium-Eva-Carriere-1912.jpg/220px-Medium-Eva-Carriere-1912.jpg
