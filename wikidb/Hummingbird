103.1	Hummingbird	Hummingbird	Hummingbirds are birds that comprise the family Trochilidae. They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring in the 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) range. Indeed, the smallest extant bird species is a hummingbird, the 5-cm Bee Hummingbird. They can hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their wings 12–80 times per second (depending on the species). They are also the only group of birds able to fly backwards. Their English name derives from the characteristic hum made by their rapid wing beats. They can fly at speeds exceeding 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Archilochus-alexandri-002-edit.jpg/220px-Archilochus-alexandri-002-edit.jpg
