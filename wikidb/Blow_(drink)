2.00	Blow_(drink)	Blow (drink)	Blow is a controversial energy drink notable for its use of drug culture in its marketing, such as the name of the drink itself, which is a slang term for cocaine. Rather than being sold in liquid form, it is distributed as vials of white powder similar in appearance to cocaine, which are to be mixed with water or any other beverage, and can be bought in large Styrofoam containers made to resemble cocaine bricks. Additional packages can be bought on the drink's website , referred to by names such as "The Recreational User Pack" or "The Fiender's Hook-Up" for various quantities. Cases on the website also include free stickers, tattoos, or shirts sporting the brand's logo. The powder has also been distributed along with a mirror and imitation credit card to simulate the "cutting" of cocaine.
