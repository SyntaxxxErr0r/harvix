28.36	Christian_art	Christian art	Christian art is sacred art produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of Christianity, though other definitions are possible. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of iconoclasm within Christianity. Images of Jesus and narrative scenes from the Life of Christ are the most common subjects, and scenes from the Old Testament play a part in the art of most denominations. Images of the Virgin Mary and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg/250px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg
