1.00	Magic_or_Madness	Magic or Madness	Magic or Madness is the first installment in Justine Larbalestier's Magic or Madness trilogy. The three main characters are Reason Cansino, Sarafina Cansino and Esmeralda Cansino. Reason and her mother Sarafina have been on the run from her grandmother Esmeralda for fifteen years staying in one place for seldom more than a few months. Her whole life Reason has been brought up with a hate for Esmeralda who believes in the practicing of magic and horrifying ritual. Only once does she recall being within her grasp but now Sarafina has had an unexpected mental breakdown, and Reason is forced back to the one place she never thought she would go back to. But after finding a portal within Esmeralda's house she starts to question her mothers beliefs and face the truth, that magic is real.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e8/Magic_or_madness.jpg
