57.4	Steam	Steam	Steam is the technical term for water vapor, the gaseous phase of water, which is formed when water boils. In common language it is often used to refer to the visible mist of water droplets formed as this water vapor condenses in the presence of cooler air. At lower pressures, such as in the upper atmosphere or at the top of high mountains water boils at a lower temperature than the nominal at standard temperature and pressure. If heated further it becomes superheated steam.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Steam_phase_eruption_of_Castle_Geyser.jpg/300px-Steam_phase_eruption_of_Castle_Geyser.jpg
