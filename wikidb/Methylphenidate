61.1	Methylphenidate	Methylphenidate	Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant drug approved for treatment of ADHD or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and narcolepsy. It may also be prescribed for off-label use in treatment-resistant cases of lethargy, depression, and obesity. Methylphenidate belongs to the piperidine class of compounds and increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain through reuptake inhibition of the respective monoamine transporters. Thus, Methylphenidate possesses structural and pharmacological similarities to cocaine, though MPH is less potent and longer in duration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Methylphenidate-2D-skeletal.svg/160px-Methylphenidate-2D-skeletal.svg.png
