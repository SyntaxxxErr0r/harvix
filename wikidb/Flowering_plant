87.2	Flowering_plant	Flowering plant	The flowering plants , also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants like the gymnosperms and can be distinguished from the gymnosperms by a series of synapomorphies (derived characteristics). These characteristics include flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Sweetbay_Magnolia_Magnolia_virginiana_Flower_Closeup_2242px.jpg/240px-Sweetbay_Magnolia_Magnolia_virginiana_Flower_Closeup_2242px.jpg
