98.6	Rapping	Rapping	Rapping (also known as emceeing, MCing, spitting (bars), or rhyming) refers to "spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics". The art form can be broken down into different components, as in the book How to Rap where it is separated into “content”, “flow” , and “delivery”. Rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Memphis_jugband.jpg
