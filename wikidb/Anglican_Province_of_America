6.10	Anglican_Province_of_America	Anglican Province of America	The Anglican Province of America (APA) is one of a number of "Continuing" Anglican churches in the United States. This church considers the Episcopal Church in the USA to be heretical, thus it maintains a church separate from that body in order to follow what it considers to be a truly Christian and Anglican tradition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/APA-shield-big.gif/100px-APA-shield-big.gif
