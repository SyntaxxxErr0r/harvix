105.1	John_Calvin	John Calvin	John Calvin (French: , born : 10 July 1509 â€“ 27 May 1564) was an influential French theologian and pastor during the Protestant Reformation. He was a principal figure in the development of the system of Christian theology later called Calvinism. Originally trained as a humanist lawyer, he broke from the Roman Catholic Church around 1530. After religious tensions provoked a violent uprising against Protestants in France, Calvin fled to Basel, Switzerland, where he published the first edition of his seminal work The Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/John_Calvin_2.jpg/220px-John_Calvin_2.jpg
