70.4	Tongue-in-cheek	Tongue-in-cheek	Tongue-in-cheek is a phrase used as a figure of speech to imply that a statement or other production is humorously intended and it should not be taken at face value. The facial expression typically indicates that one is joking or making a mental effort. In the past, it may also have indicated contempt, but that is no longer common. By 1842, the phrase had acquired its contemporary meaning similar to "take what I am saying with a grain of salt," indicating that a statement was not meant to be taken seriously. Early users of the phrase include Sir Walter Scott in his 1828 The Fair Maid of Perth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/NOMG01ThankGodForSatan.jpg/220px-NOMG01ThankGodForSatan.jpg
