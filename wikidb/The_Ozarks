76.6	The_Ozarks	The Ozarks	The Ozarks (also referred to as Ozarks Mountain Country, the Ozark Mountains, and the Ozark Plateau) are a physiographic and geologic highland region of the central United States. It covers much of the southern half of Missouri and an extensive portion of northwestern and north central Arkansas. The region also extends westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas. The wooded hills of southwest Illinois, though commonly called the "Illinois Ozarks," are generally not considered part of the true Ozarks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Knob_lick_view-26aug06.jpg/220px-Knob_lick_view-26aug06.jpg
