20.87	Longest_common_substring_problem	Longest common substring problem	In computer science, the longest common substring problem is to find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two or more strings. It should not be confused with the longest common subsequence problem. (For an explanation of the difference between a substring and a subsequence, see Substring vs. subsequence).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Suffix_tree_ABAB_BABA_ABBA.svg/400px-Suffix_tree_ABAB_BABA_ABBA.svg.png
