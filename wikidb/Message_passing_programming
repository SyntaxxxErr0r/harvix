2.00	Message_passing_programming	Message passing	Message passing in computer science is a form of communication used in parallel computing, object-oriented programming, and interprocess communication. In this model, processes or objects can send and receive messages (comprising zero or more bytes, complex data structures, or even segments of code) to other processes. By waiting for messages, processes can also synchronize.
