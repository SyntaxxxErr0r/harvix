93.0	Lake	Lake	A lake is a body of relatively still fresh or salt water of considerable size, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land. Lakes are inland and not part of the ocean and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are larger and deeper than ponds. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. However most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Oeschinen.jpg/300px-Oeschinen.jpg
