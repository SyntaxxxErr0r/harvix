56.6	Homocysteine	Homocysteine	Homocysteine is a non-protein amino acid with the formula HSCH2CH2CH(NH2)CO2H. It is a homologue of the amino acid cysteine, differing by an additional methylene (-CH2-) group. It is biosynthesized from methionine by the removal of its terminal CÎµ methyl group. Homocysteine can be recycled into methionine or converted into cysteine with the aid of B-vitamins.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Homocysteine_racemic.png/180px-Homocysteine_racemic.png
