1.00	Goat_tower	The Goat Tower	The first goat tower at a winery was built by Fernando Guedes da Silva da Fonseca (1871-1946) at Aveleda, one of the oldest and most famous wineries in the Vinho Verde region of Portugal. The second was built by Charles Back at Fairview in South Africa in 1981, Fairview Wine and Cheese farm and is a landmark in the Paarl winelands of South Africa. It is the second of five documented structures of this kind. The Goat Tower has become the farm's most identifiable symbol and aspect of their brand. Fairview has more than 750 Saanen goats on their farm, the milk from which is used to produce a range of cheeses under the farm's label. A select group of these goats have the privilege of living in the tower.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/FairviewGoatTower.JPG/220px-FairviewGoatTower.JPG
