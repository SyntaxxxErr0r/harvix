3.20	Wild_posting_campaigns	Flyposting	Flyposting (sometimes known as wild posting or bill posting) is a guerilla marketing tactic through the act of placing advertising posters or flyers in legal or illegal places. In the United States, these posters are also commonly referred to as wheatpaste posters because wheatpaste is often used to adhere the posters. Posters are adhered to construction site barricades, building facades, in alleyways.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Flypost.jpg/220px-Flypost.jpg
