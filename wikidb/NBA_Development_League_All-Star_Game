1.00	NBA_Development_League_All-Star_Game	NBA Development League All-Star Game	In the D-League All-Star Game, twenty of the league's top players were selected to the All-Star roster by a combination of fan balloting on the official D-League website and voting by the head coaches of D-League teams. The NBA players who are assigned to the D-League teams are eligible to be selected. Players who have been selected by coaches and fans must be on an active roster of a D-League team during the All-Star Weekend. If a player cannot participate whether because of injury, a recall by his NBA team, or a call-up by an NBA team, a replacement player will be named. The starting lineups were picked by the head coaches. The coaches for the All-Star game are the head coaches who currently lead the teams with the best winning percentage in the league through the three weeks before the All-Star game. The first two games were played in four quarters of 12 minutes, similar to a regular NBA or a D-League game and the NBA All-Star Game. However, the next two games were played in two 20-minute halves, similar to a college basketball game and the NBA All-Star Rookie Challenge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Pops.jpg/150px-Pops.jpg
