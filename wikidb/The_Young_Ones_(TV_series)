102.7	The_Young_Ones_(TV_series)	The Young Ones (TV series)	The Young Ones is a British sitcom, first broadcast in 1982, which ran for two series on BBC2. Its anarchic, offbeat humour helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. Soon afterwards, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/The_Young_Ones.png/250px-The_Young_Ones.png
