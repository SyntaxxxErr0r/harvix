1.20	Buddhism_in_Norway	Buddhism in Norway	Buddhism in Norway has existed since the beginning of the 1970s, after immigration from countries with Buddhist populations, mainly Vietnam and Thailand. Buddhistforbundet in Norway was established as a religious society in 1979 by two Buddhist groups (The Zen School and Karma Tashi Ling buddhistsenter) who wanted to create a common organization to preserve issues of common interest. Today, there are 14.500 members in Buddhistforbundet, but it is estimated to be over 20 thousand (0.4% of the total population) practicing Buddhists in Norway. Around 1,000 of the members are ethnic Norwegians, or 5% of the Buddhist population.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Buddhisttempel_L%C3%B8venstad.JPG/275px-Buddhisttempel_L%C3%B8venstad.JPG
