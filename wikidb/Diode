70.5	Diode	Diode	In electronics, a diode is a type of two-terminal electronic component with nonlinear resistance and conductance (i.e., a nonlinear currentâ€“voltage characteristic), distinguishing it from components such as two-terminal linear resistors which obey Ohm's law. A semiconductor diode, the most common type today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material connected to two electrical terminals. A vacuum tube diode (now rarely used except in some high-power technologies) is a vacuum tube with two electrodes: a plate and a cathode.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Diode-closeup.jpg/200px-Diode-closeup.jpg
