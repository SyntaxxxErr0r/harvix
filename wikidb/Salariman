1.10	Salariman	Salaryman	Salaryman Sararīman, salaried man) refers to someone whose income is salary based; particularly those working for corporations. Its frequent use by Japanese corporations, and its prevalence in Japanese manga and anime has gradually led to its acceptance in English-speaking countries as a noun for a Japanese white-collar businessman. The word can be found in many books and articles pertaining to Japanese culture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed as a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term carries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate hierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, wage slavery, and karōshi. The term salaryman refers exclusively to men, and for women the term career woman is used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Rush_hour_Tokyo.jpg/360px-Rush_hour_Tokyo.jpg
