1.00	Only_Ones	The Only Ones	The Only Ones are an English rock band. They were initially active in the late 1970s and were associated with punk rock, yet straddled the musical territory in between punk, power pop and hard rock, with noticeable influences from psychedelia. The band reformed in 2007 after their biggest hit "Another Girl, Another Planet" was used in a Vodafone ad campaign in 2006, and the same song was used as the intro theme to Irish DJ Dave Fanning's radio show. They completed a brief UK tour in June 2007, and more dates were played in 2008 and 2009. A collection of new material was recorded in 2009 and the songs were given an airing at a concert in London in December that year.
