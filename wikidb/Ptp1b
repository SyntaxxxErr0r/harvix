1.10	Ptp1b	PTPN1	Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 1 also known as protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an enzyme that is the founding member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. In humans it is encoded by the PTPN1 gene. PTP1B is a negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway and is considered a promising potential therapeutic target, in particular for treatment of type 2 diabetes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Protein_PTPN1_PDB_1a5y.png/250px-Protein_PTPN1_PDB_1a5y.png
