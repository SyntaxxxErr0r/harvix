3.10	Twelve_Tribes_(new_religious_movement)	Twelve Tribes communities	The Twelve Tribes , formerly known as The Vine Christian Community Church, Northeast Kingdom Community Church, The Messianic Communities, and the Community Apostolic Order is an international confederation of religious communities founded by Gene Spriggs (now known as Yoneq) that sprang out of the Jesus Movement in 1972 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The group is an attempt to recreate the 1st century church in the Book of Acts; the name "Twelve Tribes" also derives from a quote of the Apostle Paul in Acts 26:7. The group has also been referred to as The Yellow Deli People and informally as The Community.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Twelve_Tribes_Logo.jpg
