79.1	Bill_Evans	Bill Evans	William John Evans, known as Bill Evans (August 16, 1929â€“September 15, 1980) was an American jazz pianist. His use of impressionist harmony, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, and trademark rhythmically independent, "singing" melodic lines influenced a generation of pianists. He is considered by some to be the most influential post-World War II jazz pianist. Evans had a distinct playing style in which his neck would often be stooped very low, and his face parallel to the piano.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Bill_Evans.jpg/220px-Bill_Evans.jpg
