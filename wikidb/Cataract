66.8	Cataract	Cataract	A cataract is a clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its envelope , varying in degree from slight to complete opacity and obstructing the passage of light. Early in the development of age-related cataract, the power of the lens may be increased, causing near-sightedness (myopia), and the gradual yellowing and opacification of the lens may reduce the perception of blue colors. Cataracts typically progress slowly to cause vision loss, and are potentially blinding if untreated. The condition usually affects both eyes, but almost always one eye is affected earlier than the other.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Cataract_in_human_eye.png/230px-Cataract_in_human_eye.png
