18.73	BOOMERanG_experiment	BOOMERanG experiment	The BOOMERanG experiment balloon flights. It was the first experiment to make large, high fidelity images of the CMB temperature anisotropies. By using a telescope which flew at over 42,000 meters high, it was possible to reduce the atmospheric absorption of microwaves to a minimum. This allowed massive cost reduction compared to a satellite probe, though only a small part of the sky could be scanned.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Boomerang_Telescope.jpeg/300px-Boomerang_Telescope.jpeg
