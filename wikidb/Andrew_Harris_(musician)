2.00	Andrew_Harris_(musician)	Andrew Harris (musician)	Andrew Harris is a former American vocalist and multi-instrumentalist from DeKalb, Illinois, who recorded and performed under the pseudonym "Akhenaten" (after the Egyptian Pharaoh of the same name). He established himself on the black metal underground especially with his now-defunct solo project Judas Iscariot (1992–2002). During the same period, Harris also recorded and/or performed with Sarcophagus (1991–2001), Weltmacht (1998–2002), and Seeds of Hate (1999–2001, under the name "Dawn of Armageddon"). After the demise of Judas Iscariot, he abandoned the stage name "Akhenaten" in order to ensure that subsequent projects would not "suffer in the shadows of Judas Iscariot". After ending Judas Iscariot, Harris had a few other musical projects, including Debauchery (2003), Desolation Hymn (2003), and Flagellator (2001–2003). He was also live session bassist for Nargaroth in 2002. All recorded releases ceased after the beginning of 2003.
