59.9	Lost_Generation	Lost Generation	The "Lost Generation" is a term used to refer to the generation, actually a cohort, that came of age during World War I. The term was popularized by Ernest Hemingway who used it as one of two contrasting epigraphs for his novel, The Sun Also Rises. In that volume Hemingway credits the phrase to Gertrude Stein, who was then his mentor and patron.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/GertrudeStein_JackHemingway_Paris.jpg/220px-GertrudeStein_JackHemingway_Paris.jpg
