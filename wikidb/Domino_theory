54.4	Domino_theory	Domino theory	The domino theory was a reason for war during the 1950s to 1980s, promoted at times by the government of the United States, that speculated that if one state in a region came under the influence of communism, then the surrounding countries would follow in a domino effect. The domino theory was used by successive United States administrations during the Cold War to clarify the need for American intervention around the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Domino_theory.svg/400px-Domino_theory.svg.png
