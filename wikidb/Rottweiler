64.6	Rottweiler	Rottweiler	The Rottweiler is a medium to large size breed of domestic dog that originated in Rottweil, Germany. The dogs were known as "Rottweil butchers' dogs" (German: ) because they were used to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat and other products to market. Some records indicate that earlier Rottweilers may have also been used for hunting, although the modern Rottweiler has a relatively low hunting instinct.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Rottweiler3.jpg/220px-Rottweiler3.jpg
