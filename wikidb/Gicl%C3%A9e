132.6	Gicl%C3%A9e	Giclée	Giclée ( or ), is a neologism coined in 1991 by printmaker Jack Duganne for fine art digital prints made on ink-jet printers. The name originally applied to fine art prints created on IRIS printers in a process invented in the late 1980s but has since come to mean any high quality ink-jet print and is often used by artists, galleries, and print shops to denote such prints.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Prints_Pigment_Giclee.jpg/200px-Prints_Pigment_Giclee.jpg
