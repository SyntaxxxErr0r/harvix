It is one of four languages descended from the Old West Norse language spoken in the Middle Ages, the others being Icelandic, Norwegian and the extinct Norn, which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Faroese and Icelandic, its closest extant relative, are not mutually intelligible in speech, but the written languages resemble each other quite closely.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/KB_Faroese.svg/300px-KB_Faroese.svg.png
