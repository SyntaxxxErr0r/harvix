112.8	Massage	Massage	Massage is the working of superficial and deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue using various techniques, to enhance function, aid in the healing process, and promote relaxation and well-being. The word comes from the French massage "friction of kneading", or from Arabic massa meaning "to touch, feel or handle" or from Latin massa meaning "mass, dough", cf. Greek verb μάσσω "to handle, touch, to work with the hands, to knead dough". In distinction the ancient Greek word for massage was anatripsis, and the Latin was frictio.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Massage_Frankfurt.jpg/285px-Massage_Frankfurt.jpg
