4.00	Mad_money	Mad Money	Mad Money is an American finance television program hosted by Jim Cramer that began airing on CNBC on March 14, 2005. Its main focus is investment and speculation, particularly in publicly traded stocks. In a notable departure from the CNBC programming style prior to its arrival, Mad Money presents itself in an entertainment-style format rather than a news broadcasting one.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Mad_Money.png/250px-Mad_Money.png
