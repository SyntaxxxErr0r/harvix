51.6	Jesus_Camp	Jesus Camp	Jesus Camp is a 2006 American documentary film directed by Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing about a charismatic Christian summer camp, where children spend their summers learning and practicing their prophetic gifts and being taught that they can "take back America for Christ." According to the distributor, it "doesn't come with any prepackaged point of view" and tries to be "an honest and impartial depiction of one faction of the evangelical Christian community".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ad/Jesus_Camp.jpg/220px-Jesus_Camp.jpg
