92.9	Quidditch	Quidditch	Quidditch is a fictional sport created by British author J. K. Rowling for the Harry Potter series of novels. It is described as an extremely rough but very popular semi-contact sport, played by wizards and witches around the world. Matches are played between two teams of seven players riding flying broomsticks, using four balls and six elevated ring-shaped goals three on each side of the Quidditch pitch (field). In the Harry Potter universe, Quidditch holds a fervent following similar to the position that association football holds as a globally popular sport.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Quidditch_balls.jpg/200px-Quidditch_balls.jpg
