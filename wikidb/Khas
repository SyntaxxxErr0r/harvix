1.00	Khas	Khas people	Originally the Khas (खस) / Khasas or Khasiyas were the mountain dwellers living in the southern shadow of the Himalayan range from Kashmir to Bhutan in the present day countries of Nepal, India (in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and the Gorkhaland region of West Bengal), and Bhutan (especially in the parts of former Greater Nepal). Most modern Khas people will not refer to themselves as Khas, instead referring to themselves by caste (e.g. Bahun, Chhetri, or Thakuri) after falling under the influence of the caste system. The Khasas were a warlike tribe who built three capitals over time: Taklakot in Tibet, and Sinja and Dullu in Nepal. From the 11th century, their powerful kingdom, known as the Malla Empire (not related to the Malla Kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley), grew, covering much of west Nepal, Ladakh, Kashmir and western Tibet. As the empire fell apart during the 14th century, many of the ruling families migrated throughout Nepal. As a result, many common Nepali surnames (e.g. Thapa, Basnet, Bista, Adhikari and Bhandari), as well as the national language, have their roots in the ancient and once proud Khas kingdom. The Khas language is a predecessor to modern Nepali, though it is sometimes difficult for modern Nepali speakers to understand.
