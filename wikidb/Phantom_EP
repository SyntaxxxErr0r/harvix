1.00	Phantom_EP	Phantom EP	Phantom EP was the first release of Sydney punk group The Visitors. The Phantom EP was an emanation of an afternoons recording session at Palm Studios in Sydney on an 8-track recording system. The studio was booked by producer Charles Fisher for the band to record some demos, but the band set up the recording as if it where a live set and played through what was more or less their live set list. Phantom EP was a collection of what was considered to be the best recordings from the Palm Studio Sessions.
