34.73	Santoku	Santoku	The Santoku hōchō or Bunka hōchō (文化包丁) is a general-purpose kitchen knife originating in Japan. Its blade is typically between 5 and 8 inches (13 and 20 cm) long, and has a flat edge and a sheepsfoot blade that curves in an angle approaching 60 degrees at the point. The top of the santoku's handle is in line with the top of the blade. The word santoku loosely translates as 'three virtues' or 'three uses', a reference to the three cutting tasks the knife performs well: slicing; dicing; and mincing. The santoku's blade and handle are designed to work in harmony by matching the blade's width/weight to the weight of blade tang and handle, and the original Japanese santoku is considered a well-balanced knife.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Kitchen-knife-santoku-form.jpg/240px-Kitchen-knife-santoku-form.jpg
