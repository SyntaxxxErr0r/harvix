21.34	Canadian_postal_code	Postal codes in Canada	A directory of FSAs is provided, divided into separate articles by postal district. Individual FSA lists are in a tabular format, with the numbers (known as zones) going across the table and the second letter going down the table. The FSA lists specify all communities covered by each rural FSA. Medium-sized cities may have one dedicated FSA, while larger cities have more than one FSA within their limits. For FSAs spanning more than one city, the city which is allocated the most codes in each such FSA is listed. For cities with a small number of FSAs (but more than one), the lists specify the relative location of each FSA in those cities. For cities with a large number of FSAs, applicable neighbourhoods and boroughs are specified.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Components_of_a_Canadian_postal_code.png/140px-Components_of_a_Canadian_postal_code.png
