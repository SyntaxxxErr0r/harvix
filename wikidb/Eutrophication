102.8	Eutrophication	Eutrophication	Eutrophication (Greek: eutrophiaâ€”healthy, adequate nutrition, development; German: ) or more precisely hypertrophication, is the ecosystem response to the addition of artificial or natural substances, such as nitrates and phosphates, through fertilizers or sewage, to an aquatic system. One example is the "bloom" or great increase of phytoplankton in a water body as a response to increased levels of nutrients. Negative environmental effects include hypoxia, the depletion of oxygen in the water, which induces reductions in specific fish and other animal populations. Other species (such as Nomura's jellyfish in Japanese waters) may experience an increase in population that negatively affects other species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Potomac_river_eutro.jpg/220px-Potomac_river_eutro.jpg
