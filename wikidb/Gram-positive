38.03	Gram-positive	Gram-positive bacteria	Gram-positive bacteria are those that are stained dark blue or violet by Gram staining. This is in contrast to Gram-negative bacteria, which cannot retain the crystal violet stain, instead taking up the counterstain and appearing red or pink. Gram-positive organisms are able to retain the crystal violet stain because of the high amount of peptidoglycan in the cell wall. Gram-positive cell walls typically lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative bacteria.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/20110322_193829_Bacteria_SMB_UTI.jpg/300px-20110322_193829_Bacteria_SMB_UTI.jpg
