1.10	2006_PGA_Tour	2006 PGA Tour	The 2006 PGA Tour was the last season of the PGA Tour before the major reorganization of the season brought about by the introduction of the FedEx Cup in 2007. After being challenged by Phil Mickelson in the first half of the year, when Mickelson won his second straight major at the Masters and was on course to win the U.S. Open until the 72nd hole, Tiger Woods emphatically re-established his status as the dominant golfer of his era in the second half of the season by finishing with six consecutive wins, and took the Player of the Year award for the eighth time in his career. Jim Furyk had his career year to date, finishing second on the money list despite picking up only two wins, due to exceptional consistency.
