59.9	Arts	The arts	The arts are a vast subdivision of culture, composed of many creative endeavors and disciplines. It is a broader term than "art", which as a description of a field usually means only the visual arts. The arts encompass visual arts, literary arts and the performing arts â€“ music, theatre, dance and film, among others. This list is by no means comprehensive, but only meant to introduce the concept of the arts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Lincoln_Center_Twilight.jpg/400px-Lincoln_Center_Twilight.jpg
