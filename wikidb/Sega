78.1	Sega	Sega	Sega Corporation Kabushiki gaisha Sega), usually styled as SEGA, is a multinational video game software developer and an arcade software and hardware development company headquartered in ÅŒta, Tokyo, Japan, with various offices around the world. Sega previously developed and manufactured its own brand of home video game consoles from 1983 to 2001, but a restructure was announced on January 31, 2001 that ceased continued production of its existing home console, effectively exiting the company from the home console business. While arcade development would continue unchanged, the restructure shifted the focus of the company's home video game software development to consoles developed by various third-party manufacturers. They are responsible for famous video game franchise successes and failures such as Sonic the Hedgehog.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/SEGA_logo.svg/220px-SEGA_logo.svg.png
