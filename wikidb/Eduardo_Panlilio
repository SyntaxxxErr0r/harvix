2.00	Eduardo_Panlilio	Eddie Panlilio	Eduardo "Among Ed" Tongol Panlilio (born December 6, 1953) was a Kapampangan Filipino Roman Catholic priest and governor of the province of Pampanga. He was suspended from his priestly ministry upon announcing his intention to run as governor. He was elected governor in May 2007 in a closely contested three-way race against incumbent governor Mark Lapid and provincial board member Lilia Pineda. In February 2010, following a recount of votes due to an election protest, the Comelec ruled that Lilia Pineda had won the 2007 election over Panlilio. Panlilio failed in his campaign for governor in the 2010 election.
