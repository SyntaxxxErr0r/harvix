63.8	Creation_myth	Creation myth	A creation myth is a symbolic narrative of how the world began and how people first came to inhabit it. They develop in oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions; and they are the most common form of myth, found throughout human culture. In the society in which it is told, a creation myth is usually regarded as conveying profound truths, metaphorically, symbolically and sometimes even in a historical or literal sense. They are commonly, although not always, considered cosmogonical mythsâ€”that is they describe the ordering of the cosmos from a state of chaos or amorphousness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/The_Creation_of_Adam.jpg/200px-The_Creation_of_Adam.jpg
