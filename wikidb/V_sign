89.5	V_sign	V sign	The V sign is a hand gesture in which the index and middle fingers are raised and parted, while the other fingers are clenched. It has various meanings, depending on the cultural context and how it is presented. It is most commonly used to represent the letter V as in "victory", as a symbol of peace (usually with palm outward), as an offensive gesture (palm inward), to represent the number two, and as purely expressive gesture with no intended meaning. It was adopted by the 1960s counterculture movement as a sign for peace.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/JSC_Stardust_2006.jpg/220px-JSC_Stardust_2006.jpg
