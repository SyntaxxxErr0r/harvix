51.3	Jeremy_Paxman	Jeremy Paxman	Jeremy Dickson Paxman (born 11 May 1950) is an English journalist, author and broadcaster. He has worked for the BBC since 1977. He is noted for a forthright and abrasive interviewing style, particularly when interrogating politicians. His regular appearances on the BBC2's Newsnight programme have been criticised as aggressive, intimidating and condescending, and also applauded as tough and incisive. He is also the question master of University Challenge, taking over from Bamber Gascoigne when the programme was revived in 1994.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Jeremy_Paxman%2C_September_2009_2_cropped.jpg/180px-Jeremy_Paxman%2C_September_2009_2_cropped.jpg
