51.3	Great_American_Novel	Great American Novel	The "Great American Novel" is the concept of a novel that is distinguished in both craft and theme as being the most accurate representative of the zeitgeist in the United States at the time of its writing. It is presumed to be written by an American author who is knowledgeable about the state, culture, and perspective of the common American citizen. The author uses the literary work to identify and exhibit the language used by the American people of the time and to capture the unique American experience, especially as it is perceived for the time. In historical terms, it is sometimes equated as being the American response to the national epic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Huckleberry_Finn_book.JPG/200px-Huckleberry_Finn_book.JPG
