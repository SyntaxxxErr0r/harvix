106.9	Griot	Griot	A griot (French pronunciation: ) or jeli (djeli or dj√©li in French spelling) is a West African storyteller, praise singer, poet and musician. The griot is a repository of oral tradition. As such, they are sometimes also called bards. According to Paul Oliver in his book Savannah Syncopators, "Though has to know many traditional songs without error, he must also have the ability to extemporize on current events, chance incidents and the passing scene. His wit can be devastating and his knowledge of local history formidable." Although they are popularly known as 'praise singers', griots may also use their vocal expertise for gossip, satire, or political comment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/GriotF%C3%AAte.jpg/200px-GriotF%C3%AAte.jpg
