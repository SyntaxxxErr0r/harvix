1.00	Stikky	Stikky	Stikky was an American punk rock band, formed in Berkeley, California in 1985. The band was part of the 924 Gilman Street-scene. Its members were Chris Dodge (bass, vocals), Chris Wilder (guitar, vocals), and Todd Wilder (drums, vocals). Their songs are known for being hardcore punk yet still retaining the sense of humor that East Bay bands were known for. After the band stopped playing with any regularity, bassist Chris Dodge released some of their material on his own record label Slap a Ham Records.
