2.00	Districts_of_the_Unitarian_Universalist_Association	Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association	The Unitarian Universalist Association, an association of Unitarian Universalist Congregations in the United States of America, is composed of 19 Districts. Each District has its own District-level organization, complete with governing body (in the form of an elected council, or board) and all. Districts provide services to their member congregations, including help with ministerial settlement. Each District has a representative on the UUA's Board of Trustees. Collaborations between districts have also resulted in the creation of five unofficial "regions": the Central East Regional Group, the Southern Region, MidAmerica Region, Pacific Western Region and New England Region.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/UUA_Districts.gif
