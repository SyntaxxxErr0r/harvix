66.1	Originalism	Originalism	In the context of United States constitutional interpretation, originalism is a principle of interpretation that tries to discover the original meaning or intent of the constitution. It is based on the principle that the judiciary is not supposed to create, amend or repeal laws (which is the realm of the legislative branch) but only to uphold them. The term is a neologism, and the concept is a formalist theory of law and a corollary of textualism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.png/250px-Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.png.jpeg
