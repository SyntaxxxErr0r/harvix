139.0	Quark	Quark	A quark ( or ) is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. Due to a phenomenon known as color confinement, quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can only be found within baryons or mesons. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Quark_structure_proton.svg/225px-Quark_structure_proton.svg.png
