51.3	Italians	Italians	Italians (Italian: ) are an ethnic group native of Western Europe that share a common Italian culture, ancestry and speak the Italian language as a mother tongue. Within Italy, Italians are defined by citizenship, regardless of ancestry or country of residence (though the principle of jus sanguinis is used extensively and arguably more favorably in the Italian nationality law), and are distinguished from people of Italian descent and, historically, from ethnic Italians living in the unredeemed territories adjacent to the Italian Peninsula.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Famous_Italians_Collage.jpg/300px-Famous_Italians_Collage.jpg
