156.9	Fashion	Fashion	Fashion is a general term for a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, foot wear, or accessories. "Fashion" refers to current trends in look and dress up of a person, as well as to prevailing styles in behavior. The more technical term, "costume," has become so linked in the public eye with the term "fashion" that the more general term "costume" has in popular use mostly been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while the term "fashion" means clothing generally, and the study of it. For a broad cross-cultural look at clothing and its place in society, refer to the entries for clothing, costume, and fabrics. The remainder of this article deals with clothing fashions in the Western world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/1796-short-bodied-gillray-fashion-caricature.jpg/220px-1796-short-bodied-gillray-fashion-caricature.jpg
