78.6	Data_Encryption_Standard	Data Encryption Standard	The Data Encryption Standard is a previously predominant algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. It was highly influential in the advancement of modern cryptography in the academic world. Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency (NSA), the NBS eventually selected a slightly modified version, which was published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977. The publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard simultaneously resulted in its quick international adoption and widespread academic scrutiny. Controversies arose out of classified design elements, a relatively short key length of the symmetric-key block cipher design, and the involvement of the NSA, nourishing suspicions about a backdoor. While these suspicions eventually have turned out to be unfounded, the intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Data_Encryption_Standard_InfoBox_Diagram.png/300px-Data_Encryption_Standard_InfoBox_Diagram.png
