52.7	Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter	Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter	The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is a NASA robotic spacecraft currently orbiting the Moon on a low polar mapping orbit. The LRO mission is a precursor to future manned missions to the Moon by NASA. To this end a detailed mapping program will identify safe landing sites, locate potential resources on the Moon, characterize the radiation environment, and demonstrate new technology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/LRO_2006.jpg/300px-LRO_2006.jpg
