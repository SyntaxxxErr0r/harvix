90.2	Deconstruction	Deconstruction	Deconstruction is a term introduced by French philosopher Jacques Derrida in his 1967 book Of Grammatology. Although he carefully avoided defining the term directly, he sought to apply Martin Heidegger's concept of Destruktion or Abbau, to textual reading, that is, the critical analysis of written language, literature in particular. Heidegger's term referred to a process of exploring the categories and concepts that tradition has imposed on a word, and the history behind them. Derrida opted for deconstruction over the literal translation destruction to suggest precision rather than violence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Pepsi_in_India.jpg/110px-Pepsi_in_India.jpg
