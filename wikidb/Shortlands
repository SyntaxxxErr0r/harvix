3.60	Shortlands	Shortlands	Shortlands is a ward of the London Borough of Bromley, located less than a mile from Bromley town centre. Historically, Shortlands was known as Clay Hill. It became known as Shortlands around 1800, after the fields which, at this point of the Ravensbourne river, ran at right angles up the slopes on either side. Suburban development began in 1863 with the sale of the Shortands House estate, making full advantage of the railway station opened in May 1858.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Greater_London_UK_location_map_2.svg/240px-Greater_London_UK_location_map_2.svg.png
