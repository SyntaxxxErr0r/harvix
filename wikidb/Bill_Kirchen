7.70	Bill_Kirchen	Bill Kirchen	Bill Kirchen (born June 29, 1948) is an American rockabilly guitarist, singer and songwriter. He was the guitarist with the original Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen from 1967 to the mid 1970s, although, in reality, his time with the Commander accounts for only a portion of his career. Known as "The Titan of The Telecaster" for his big, twangy licks and diverse musical styles, he played the unmistakable lead on the 1972 Commander Cody hit "Hot Rod Lincoln." In the years since, his body of work has been rich and varied, recording albums and making dozens of appearances on recordings by other artists. Kirchen grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he attended Ann Arbor High School with Iggy Pop and Bob Seger. In recent years, Kirchen has toured or recorded with Nick Lowe, Elvis Costello, Doug Sahm, Emmylou Harris, Austin de Lone and others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/BillKirchenRed.jpg/220px-BillKirchenRed.jpg
