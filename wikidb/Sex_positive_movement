8.00	Sex_positive_movement	Sex-positive movement	The term free love has been used since at least the 19th century to describe a social movement that rejects marriage, which is seen as a form of social bondage, especially for women. According to this concept, the free unions of adults are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free-love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure. In the Victorian era, this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a harbinger of a new anti-authoritarian, anti-repressive pacifist sensibility.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Love_Outside_The_Box.svg/200px-Love_Outside_The_Box.svg.png
