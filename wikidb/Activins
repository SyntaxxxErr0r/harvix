1.00	Activins	Activin and inhibin	Activin and inhibin are two closely related protein complexes that have almost directly opposite biological effects. Activin enhances FSH biosynthesis and secretion, and participates in the regulation of the menstrual cycle. Many other functions have been found to be exerted by activin, including roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, homeostasis, immune response, wound repair, and endocrine function. Conversely inhibin down regulates FSH synthesis and inhibits FSH secretion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/2ARV.png/220px-2ARV.png
