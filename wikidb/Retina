73.9	Retina	Retina	The vertebrate retina (from Latin rÄ“te, meaning "net") is a light-sensitive tissue lining the inner surface of the eye. The optics of the eye create an image of the visual world on the retina, which serves much the same function as the film in a camera. Light striking the retina initiates a cascade of chemical and electrical events that ultimately trigger nerve impulses. These are sent to various visual centers of the brain through the fibers of the optic nerve.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Human_eye_cross-sectional_view_grayscale.png/250px-Human_eye_cross-sectional_view_grayscale.png
