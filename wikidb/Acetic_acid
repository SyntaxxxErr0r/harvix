It is a colourless liquid that when undiluted is also called glacial acetic acid. Acetic acid is the main component of vinegar (apart from water), and has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. It is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinylacetate and cellulose acetate. Although it is classified as a weak acid, concentrated acetic acid is corrosive, and attacks the skin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Acetic-acid-2D-skeletal.svg/121px-Acetic-acid-2D-skeletal.svg.png
