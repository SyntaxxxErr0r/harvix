12.21	Eastern_Parkway_(Brooklyn)	Eastern Parkway (Brooklyn)	Eastern Parkway is a major boulevard that runs through a portion of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The road begins at Grand Army Plaza and extends east, running parallel to Atlantic Avenue, along the crest of the moraine that separates northern from southern Long Island, to Ralph Avenue. There, it turns to the northeast, still following the moraine, until it terminates at Evergreen Cemetery where the moraine takes a steep climb towards a peak at Ridgewood Reservoir.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Eastern_Pkwy_west_of_New_York_Ave.JPG/250px-Eastern_Pkwy_west_of_New_York_Ave.JPG
