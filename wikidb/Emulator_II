4.00	Emulator_II	E-mu Emulator	The Emulator is the name given to a series of disk-based digital sampling keyboards manufactured by E-mu Systems from 1982 until 1990. Though not the first commercial sampler, the Emulator was among the first to find wide use among ordinary musicians, due to its relatively low price and its size, which allowed for its use in live performance. It was also innovative in its integration of computer technology with electronic keyboards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/E-mu_Emulator_II.jpg/350px-E-mu_Emulator_II.jpg
