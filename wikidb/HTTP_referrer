57.5	HTTP_referrer	HTTP referer	The HTTP referer —originally a misspelling of referrer that occurs as an HTTP header field — identifies, from the point of view of an Internet webpage or resource, the address of the webpage (commonly the Uniform Resource Locator (URL); the more-generic Uniform Resource Identifier (URI); or the internationalization and localization (i18n)-updated Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)) of the resource which links to it. By checking the referer, the new webpage can see where the request originated.
