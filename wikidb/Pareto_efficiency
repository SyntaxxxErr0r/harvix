82.0	Pareto_efficiency	Pareto efficiency	An economic system that is not Pareto efficient implies that a certain change in allocation of goods (for example) may result in some individuals being made "better off" with no individual being made worse off, and therefore can be made more Pareto efficient through a Pareto improvement. Here 'better off' is often interpreted as "put in a preferred position." It is commonly accepted that outcomes that are not Pareto efficient are to be avoided, and therefore Pareto efficiency is an important criterion for evaluating economic systems and public policies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve_Pareto.svg.png/300px-Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve_Pareto.svg.png
