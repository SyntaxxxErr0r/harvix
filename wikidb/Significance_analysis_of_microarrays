1.10	Significance_analysis_of_microarrays	Significance analysis of microarrays	Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) is a statistical technique, established in 2001 by Virginia Tusher, Robert Tibshirani and Gilbert Chu, for determining whether changes in gene expression are statistically significant. With the advent of DNA microarrays it is now possible to measure the expression of thousands of genes in a single hybridization experiment. The data generated is considerable and a method for sorting out what is significant and what isnâ€™t is essential. SAM is distributed by Stanford University in an R-package.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Expressionpic2.jpg/220px-Expressionpic2.jpg
