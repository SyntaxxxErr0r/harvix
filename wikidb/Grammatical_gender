66.4	Grammatical_gender	Grammatical gender	Grammatical gender is defined linguistically as a system of classes of nouns which trigger specific types of inflections in associated words, such as adjectives, verbs and others. While Old English (Anglo-Saxon) had grammatical gender, Modern English is normally described as lacking grammatical gender, outside of its pronouns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/French_country_name_genders.svg/350px-French_country_name_genders.svg.png
