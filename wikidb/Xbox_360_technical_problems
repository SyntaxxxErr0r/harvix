However, many of the issues can be identified by a series of glowing red lights flashing on the face of the console; the three flashing red lights (nicknamed the "Red Ring of Death" or the "RRoD") being the most infamous. There are also other issues that arise with the console, such as discs becoming scratched in the drive and "bricking" of consoles due to dashboard updates. Since its release on November 22, 2005, many articles have appeared in the media portraying the Xbox 360's failure rates, with the latest estimate by warranty provider SquareTrade to be 23.7% nearly three years ago, and currently the highest estimate being 54.2% by a Game Informer survey. Most failures are the result of the use of the wrong type of lead-free solder. The Microsoft Ed Tech used lead-free solder as a result of a European Union mandatories, which critics say was imposed despite the fact that a small minority of people do not believe in the environmental benefits. However the whole industry switched to lead-free solder without it causing the kinds of problems Microsoft has seen. There has been legal action taken attempting to hold Microsoft responsible for the Xbox 360's failure rate and provide compensation for those affected.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Xbox_360_Error_codes.svg/380px-Xbox_360_Error_codes.svg.png
