70.7	Citric_acid	Citric acid	Citric acid is a weak organic acid. It is a natural preservative/conservative and is also used to add an acidic, or sour, taste to foods and soft drinks. In biochemistry, the conjugate base of citric acid, citrate, is important as an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, and therefore occurs in the metabolism of virtually all living things.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Zitronens%C3%A4ure_-_Citric_acid.svg/200px-Zitronens%C3%A4ure_-_Citric_acid.svg.png
