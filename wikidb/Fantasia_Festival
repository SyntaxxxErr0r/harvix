13.11	Fantasia_Festival	Fantasia Festival	Fantasia International Film Festival (also known as Fantasia-fest, FanTasia, Fant-Asia) is a genre film festival that has been based mainly in Montreal since its founding in 1996. Regularly held in July of each year, it is valued by both hardcore genre film fans, and distributors, who take advantage of the eclectic line up to select foreign and domestic films for release across North America. By virtue of the reputation developed over the last 15 years, this festival has been described as perhaps the "most outstanding and largest genre film festival in North America".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/FantasiaFestival_50x70.jpg/200px-FantasiaFestival_50x70.jpg
