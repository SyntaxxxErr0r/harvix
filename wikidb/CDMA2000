73.7	CDMA2000	CDMA2000	CDMA2000 (also known as IMT Multi‑Carrier (IMT‑MC)) is a family of 3G mobile technology standards, which use CDMA channel access, to send voice, data, and signaling data between mobile phones and cell sites. The set of standards includes: CDMA2000 1X, CDMA2000 EV-DO Rev. 0, CDMA2000 EV-DO Rev. A, and CDMA2000 EV-DO Rev. B. All are approved radio interfaces for the ITU's IMT-2000. CDMA2000 has a relatively long technical history and is backward-compatible with its previous 2G iteration IS-95 (cdmaOne). In the United States, CDMA2000 is a registered trademark of the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA-USA).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/3G_With_USB_cable.jpg/220px-3G_With_USB_cable.jpg
