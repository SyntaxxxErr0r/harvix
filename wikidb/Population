171.8	Population	Population	A population is all the organisms that both belong to the same group or species and live in the same geographical area. In ecology the population of a certain species in a certain area is estimated using the Lincoln Index. The area that is used to define a sexual population is such that inter-breeding is possible between any pair within the area and more probable than cross-breeding with individuals from other areas. Normally breeding is substantially more common within the area than across the border.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Population_density.png/350px-Population_density.png
