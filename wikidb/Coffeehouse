65.6	Coffeehouse	Coffeehouse	A coffeehouse or coffee shop is an establishment which primarily serves prepared coffee or other hot beverages. It shares some of the characteristics of a bar, and some of the characteristics of a restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. As the name suggests, coffeehouses focus on providing coffee and tea as well as light snacks. Many coffee houses in the Middle East, and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world, offer shisha (nargile in Turkish and Greek), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Caf%C3%A9_de_Flore.jpg/220px-Caf%C3%A9_de_Flore.jpg
