134.3	Heavy_metal_music	Heavy metal music	Heavy metal (often referred to simply as metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the Midlands of the United Kingdom and in the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are generally associated with masculinity and machismo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Judas_Priest_Retribution_2005_Tour.jpg/220px-Judas_Priest_Retribution_2005_Tour.jpg
