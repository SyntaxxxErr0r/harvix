4.11	Seasoned_rice_vinegar	Seasoned rice vinegar	Seasoned rice vinegar or awasezu (合わせ酢) is a condiment made of vinegar with sake, sugar and salt added. Besides these three necessary ingredients, mirin is also sometimes used (but only rarely). Although it can be made at home, prepared awasezu can also be readily bought at supermarkets. Seasoned rice vinegar is added to cooked rice to be used in making sushi. It is also used in salad dressing varieties popular in the west, such as ginger or sesame dressing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Marukan_seasoned_rice_vinegar.JPG/150px-Marukan_seasoned_rice_vinegar.JPG
