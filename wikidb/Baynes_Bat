8.11	Baynes_Bat	Baynes Bat	The Baynes Bat (or sometimes Slingsby-Baynes Bat) was an experimental glider of the Second World War, designed by L.E. Baynes. It was used to test the tailless design that he had suggested as a means to convert tanks into temporary gliders so they could be flown into battle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Baynes_Bat.jpg/300px-Baynes_Bat.jpg
