3.01	Kramer_v._Union_School_District	Kramer v. Union School District	Kramer v. Union School District, 395 U.S. 621 (1969) was a United States Supreme Court decision in which a childless bachelor living with his parents in the Union School District challenged Section 2012 of the New York Education Law which stated that voters for school district elections must own or lease taxable realty property in the district or be parents or custodians of one or more children enrolled in a public school local to the district. New York's argument was to limit the franchise to those primarily affected by education.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg/100px-Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png
