42.06	Chef_(South_Park)	Chef (South Park)	Jerome "Chef" McElroy was a fictional character on the Comedy Central series South Park who was voiced by soul singer Isaac Hayes. A cafeteria worker (as his nickname implies) at the local elementary school in the town of South Park, Colorado, Chef was generally portrayed as more level-headed than the other adult residents of the town. His guidance was often sought by the show's core group of child protagonists – Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick – as he was usually the only adult whom they consistently trusted. To an inadvertent fault, he would frequently give inappropriate advice, usually in the non sequitur form of a lascivious soul song.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1e/SouthParkChef.png/180px-SouthParkChef.png
