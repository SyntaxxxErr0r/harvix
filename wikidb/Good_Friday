139.1	Good_Friday	Good Friday	Good Friday (from the senses pious, holy of the word "good"), is a religious holiday observed primarily by Christians commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary. The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover. It is also known as Black Friday, Holy Friday, Great Friday, or Easter Friday, though the latter normally refers to the Friday in Easter week.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/N-s-dos-passos-19.jpg/225px-N-s-dos-passos-19.jpg
