1.00	Ultra-martian	Hélène Smith	Daughter of a Hungarian merchant, Smith worked as an employee in a commercial house. She discovered spiritualism in 1891 and joined a spiritualist "development" circle. According to her fellow believers, she began to show evidence of mediumistic abilities in 1892, and claimed to communicate with Victor Hugo and Cagliostro. She became well known in Geneva, and it was there that Flournoy made her acquaintance. Her channeling evolved from the usual raps and table-tipping to somnambulatory trances, of which she remembered nothing. While in this state she experienced clear images of faraway places such as a civilization on Mars, and of her own former lives. She would write out the Martian communications on paper and translate them into French, popularizing automatic writing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8neSmith_martien01.jpg/220px-H%C3%A9l%C3%A8neSmith_martien01.jpg
