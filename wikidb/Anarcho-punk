42.06	Anarcho-punk	Anarcho-punk	Anarcho-punk is punk rock that promotes anarchism. The term anarcho-punk is sometimes applied exclusively to bands that were part of the original anarcho-punk movement in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some use the term more broadly to refer to any punk music with anarchist lyrical content, including crust punk, d-beat, folk punk, hardcore punk, garage punk or ska punk.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Crass_pete_steve_andy.png/150px-Crass_pete_steve_andy.png
