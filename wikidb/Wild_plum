2.02	Wild_plum	Prunus americana	Prunus americana, commonly called the American Plum, Wild Plum, or Marshall's Large Yellow Sweet Plum, is a species of Prunus native to North America from Saskatchewan to New Mexico east to New Hampshire and Florida. It has often been planted outside its core range and sometimes escapes cultivation. It is commonly confused with the Canada Plum , although the fruit is smaller and rounder and bright red as opposed to yellow. Many cultivated varieties have been derived from this species. It forms an excellent stock upon which to graft the domestic plum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Prunus_americana.jpg/220px-Prunus_americana.jpg
