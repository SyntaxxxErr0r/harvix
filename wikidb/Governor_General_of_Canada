64.5	Governor_General_of_Canada	Governor General of Canada	The Governor General of Canada is the federal viceregal representative of the Canadian monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. As the sovereign is shared equally with 15 other independent countries in a form of personal union, as well as with the ten other jurisdictions of Canada, and resides predominantly in her oldest realm, the United Kingdom, she, on the advice of her Canadian prime minister only, appoints the governor general to carry out most of her constitutional and ceremonial duties for an unfixed period of time—known as serving at Her Majesty's pleasure—though five years is the normal convention. Also traditional is a rotation between anglophone and francophone incumbents. Once in office, the governor general maintains direct contact with the Queen, wherever she may be at the time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Crest_of_the_Governor-General_of_Canada.svg/100px-Crest_of_the_Governor-General_of_Canada.svg.png
