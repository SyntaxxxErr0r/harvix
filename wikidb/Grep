131.2	Grep	grep	A variety of grep implementations is available in many operating systems and software development environments. Early variants included egrep and fgrep, introduced in Version 7 Unix. egrep applies an extended regular expression syntax that was added to Unix after Ken Thompson's original regular expression implementation. fgrep searches for any of a list of fixed strings using the Ahoâ€“Corasick string matching algorithm. These variants of grep persist in most modern grep implementations as command-line switches (and standardized as -E and -F in POSIX). In such combined implementations, grep may also behave differently depending on the name by which it is invoked, allowing fgrep, egrep, and grep to be links to the same program file.
