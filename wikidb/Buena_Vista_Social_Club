In the 1990s, nearly 50 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by Cuban musician Juan de Marcos Gonz√°lez and American guitarist Ry Cooder with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Cropped_image_of_Compay.jpg
