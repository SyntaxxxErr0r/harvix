569.4	Facebook	Facebook	Facebook is a social networking service and website launched in February 2004, operated and privately owned by Facebook Inc. As of February 2012 , Facebook has more than 845 million active users. Users must register before using the site, after which they may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, and exchange messages, including automatic notifications when they update their profile. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". The name of the service stems from the colloquial name for the book given to students at the start of the academic year by some university administrations in the United States to help students get to know each other. Facebook allows any users who declare themselves to be at least 13 years old to become registered users of the site.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Facebook.svg/215px-Facebook.svg.png
