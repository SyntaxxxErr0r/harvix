A mainstay of modern Greek music, the front of the body is flat and is usually heavily inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The instrument is played with a plectrum and has a sharp metallic sound, reminiscent of a mandolin but pitched lower. There are two main types of bouzouki. The three-course with three pairs of strings (known as courses) and the four-course having four pairs of strings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Bouzouki_tetrachordo.jpg/250px-Bouzouki_tetrachordo.jpg
