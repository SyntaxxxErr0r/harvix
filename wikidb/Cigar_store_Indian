12.71	Cigar_store_Indian	Cigar store Indian	The cigar store Indian or wooden Indian is an advertisement figure, in the likeness of an American Indian, made to represent tobacconists, much like: barber poles advertise barber shops; Show globe for an apothecary; or the three gold balls of the pawn shop. The figures are often three-dimensional wooden sculptures several feet tall â€“ up to life-sized. They are still occasionally used for their original advertising purpose but are more often seen as decorations or advertising collectibles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Cigar_store_indian.jpg/170px-Cigar_store_indian.jpg
