Scott-Heron first recorded it for his 1970 album Small Talk at 125th and Lenox, on which he recited the lyrics, accompanied by congas and bongo drums. A re-recorded version, with a full band, was the B-side to Scott-Heron's first single, "Home Is Where the Hatred Is", from his album Pieces of a Man (1971). It was also included on his compilation album, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (1974). All these releases were issued on the Flying Dutchman Productions record label.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c0/The_Revolution_Will_Not_Be_Televised.jpg/220px-The_Revolution_Will_Not_Be_Televised.jpg
