The museum was originally instituted as a natural history museum with a focus on the natural history and environment of Nevada and the broader Southwestern United States. Beginning in 1979 the museum's anthropological collections were greatly expanded, with the subsequent additions of donated collections of ethnographic and archaeological artifacts representing Native American and pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/USA_Nevada_location_map.svg/250px-USA_Nevada_location_map.svg.png
