2.01	The_Sea_Beast	The Sea Beast	The Sea Beast is a silent film adaptation of the novel Moby Dick by Herman Melville, a story about a monomaniacal hunt for a great white whale. However, the film alters the novel's plotline by establishing prequel(the romancing of Esther) and sequel(Ahab's safe return) elements that are not in the original story and substitutes a happy ending for Melville's original tragic one in which the entire crew of the ship Pequod, save for crew member Ishmael, is killed by Moby Dick.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Theseabeast.jpg/220px-Theseabeast.jpg
