2.01	Hasmonean_dynasty	Hasmonean dynasty	The Hasmonean dynasty (, Hebrew: â€Ž Hashmonayim, Audio), was the ruling dynasty of Kingdom of Judah and surrounding regions during classical antiquity. Between c. 140 and c. 116 BCE, the dynasty ruled semi-autonomously from the Seleucids in the region of Judea. From 110 BCE, with the Seleucid empire disintegrating, the dynasty became fully independent, expanded in to the neighbouring regions of Galilee, Iturea, Perea, Idumea and Samaria, and took the title "basileus". Some modern scholars refer to this period as an independent kingdom of Israel. In 63 BCE, the kingdom was conquered by the Roman Republic, broken up and set up as a Roman client state. The Kingdom had survived for 103 years before yielding to the Herodian Dynasty in 37 BCE. Even then, Herod the Great tried to bolster the legitimacy of his reign by marrying a Hasmonean princess, Mariamne, and planning to drown the last male Hasmonean heir at his Jericho palace.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Hasmoneese_rijk.PNG/250px-Hasmoneese_rijk.PNG
