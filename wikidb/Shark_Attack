2.00	Shark_Attack	Shark attack	A shark attack is an attack on a human by a shark. Every year around 60 shark attacks are reported worldwide, although death is quite unusual. Despite the relative rarity of shark attacks, the fear of sharks is a common phenomenon, having been fueled by the occasional instances of serial attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and by horror fiction and films, such as the Jaws series. Almost all shark experts feel that the danger presented by sharks has been exaggerated, and even the creator of the Jaws phenomenon, the late Peter Benchley, attempted to dispel the myth of sharks being man-eating monsters in the years before his death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Shark_warning_-_Salt_Rock_South_Africa.jpg/230px-Shark_warning_-_Salt_Rock_South_Africa.jpg
