52.7	Michael_Bolton	Michael Bolton	Michael Bolton (born Michael Bolotin; February 26, 1953) is an American singer and songwriter. Bolton originally performed in the hard rock and heavy metal genres from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s, both on his early solo albums and those recorded as the frontman of the band Blackjack. He is best known, however, for his series of soft rock ballads, recorded after a stylistic change in the late 1980s. He is noted for his distinctive tenor/countertenor vocals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Michael_Bolton-01.jpg/220px-Michael_Bolton-01.jpg
