70.1	Alain_Badiou	Alain Badiou	Alain Badiou ·) (born 17 January 1937 in Rabat, Morocco) is a French philosopher, professor at European Graduate School, formerly chair of Philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS). Along with Giorgio Agamben and Slavoj Žižek, Badiou is a prominent figure in an anti-postmodern strand of continental philosophy. Badiou seeks to recover the concepts of being, truth and the subject in a way that, he claims, is neither postmodern nor simply a repetition of modernity. Politically, Badiou is committed to the far left, and to the communist tradition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Alain_Badiou_2010_b.jpg/200px-Alain_Badiou_2010_b.jpg
