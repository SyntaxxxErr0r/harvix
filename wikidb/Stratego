59.9	Stratego	Stratego	Stratego is a board game for two players on a 10Ã—10 square board. Each player controls 40 pieces representing individual officers and soldiers in an army. The objective of the game is to find and capture the opponent's Flag, or to capture so many enemy pieces that the opponent cannot make any further moves. Players cannot see the ranks of one another's pieces, so disinformation and discovery are important facets to gameplay.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/Stratego_Board.jpg/300px-Stratego_Board.jpg
