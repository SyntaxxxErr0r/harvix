1.00	Moment_of_inertia_tensor	Moment of inertia	In classical mechanics, moment of inertia, also called mass moment of inertia, rotational inertia, polar moment of inertia of mass, or the angular mass, (SI units kg·m²) is a measure of an object's resistance to changes to its rotation. It is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation. The moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational dynamics as mass does in linear dynamics, describing the relationship between angular momentum and angular velocity, torque and angular acceleration, and several other quantities. The symbols I and sometimes J are usually used to refer to the moment of inertia or polar moment of inertia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Cup_of_Russia_2010_-_Yuko_Kawaguti_%282%29.jpg/220px-Cup_of_Russia_2010_-_Yuko_Kawaguti_%282%29.jpg
