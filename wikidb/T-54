6.00	T-54	T-54/55	The T-54 and T-55 tanks were a series of main battle tanks designed in the Soviet Union. The first T-54 prototype appeared in March 1945, just before the end of the Second World War. The T-54 entered full production in 1947 and became the main tank for armored units of the Soviet Army, armies of the Warsaw Pact countries, and others. T-54s and T-55s were involved in many of the world's armed conflicts during the late 20th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/T-54-.jpg/300px-T-54-.jpg
