67.6	Accuracy_and_precision	Accuracy and precision	In the fields of science, engineering, industry and statistics, the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's actual (true) value. The precision of a measurement system, also called reproducibility or repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results. Although the two words reproducibility and repeatability can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Accuracy_and_precision.svg/300px-Accuracy_and_precision.svg.png
