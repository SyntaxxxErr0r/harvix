66.7	Weimaraner	Weimaraner	The Weimaraner is a dog that was originally bred for hunting in the early 19th century. Early Weimaraners were used by royalty for hunting large game such as boar, bear, and deer. As the popularity of large game hunting began to decline, Weimaraners were used for hunting smaller animals like fowl, rabbits, and foxes. Weimaraners are great water dogs as evidenced by their webbed toes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Weimaraner_wb.jpg/220px-Weimaraner_wb.jpg
