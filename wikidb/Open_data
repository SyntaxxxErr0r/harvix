59.4	Open_data	Open data	Open data is the idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. The goals of the open data movement are similar to those of other "Open" movements such as open source, open content, and open access. The philosophy behind open data has been long established (for example in the Mertonian tradition of science), but the term "open data" itself is recent, gaining popularity with the rise of the Internet and World Wide Web and, especially, with the launch of open-data government initiatives such as Data.gov.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Linking-Open-Data-diagram_2007-09.png/220px-Linking-Open-Data-diagram_2007-09.png
