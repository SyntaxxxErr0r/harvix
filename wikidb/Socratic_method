162.3	Socratic_method	Socratic method	The Socratic method (also known as method of elenchus, elenctic method, Socratic irony, or Socratic debate), named after the classical Greek philosopher Socrates, is a form of inquiry and debate between individuals with opposing viewpoints based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to illuminate ideas. It is a dialectical method, often involving an oppositional discussion in which the defense of one point of view is pitted against the defense of another; one participant may lead another to contradict him in some way, strengthening the inquirer's own point.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/UWASocrates_gobeirne_cropped.jpg/200px-UWASocrates_gobeirne_cropped.jpg
