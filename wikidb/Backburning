1.01	Backburning	Controlled burn	Controlled or prescribed burning, also known as hazard reduction burning or Swailing is a technique sometimes used in forest management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement. Fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters. Hazard reduction or controlled burning is conducted during the cooler months to reduce fuel buildup and decrease the likelihood of serious hotter fires. Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, thus renewing the forest. Some cones, such as sequoia and serotinous require heat from fire to open cones to disperse seeds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Northwest_Crown_Fire_Experiment.png/220px-Northwest_Crown_Fire_Experiment.png
