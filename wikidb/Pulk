13.10	Pulk	Pulk	A pulk (from Finnish pulkka) is a Scandinavian short, low-slung small toboggan used in sport or for transport, pulled by a dog or a skier. The name of the sport is pulka. The sled can be used to carry supplies such as a tent or food, or transport a child or other person. In Norway, pulks are often used by families with small children on skiing trips (small children being pulled by the parents). Pulks are nowadays made of plastic, which makes them cheap to buy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/12_04_2003_repo.jpg/220px-12_04_2003_repo.jpg
