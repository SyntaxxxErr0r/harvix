Initially offered as a two-door sedan, Ford offered "Runabout" hatchback and wagon models the following year, competing in the U.S. market with the AMC Gremlin and Chevrolet Vega, as well as imported cars from Volkswagen, Datsun, and Toyota. By January 1971, the Pinto had sold over 100,000 units. In its last model year, Ford built 68,179 units.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Ford_Pinto.jpg/250px-Ford_Pinto.jpg
