21.86	Topfreedom	Topfreedom	Topfreedom is a cultural and political movement seeking to advance gender equality by the recognition of the right of women and girls to be topless in public on the same basis that men and boys are permitted to be barechested. In addition, topfreedom advocates seek recognition of the right of nursing mothers to openly breastfeed in public, and of women to sun bathe topless. The Topfree Equal Rights Association (TERA) also assists women in Canada who have been charged for being topless, while GoTopless organizes demonstrations in the United States to protest against the legal and public attitude to the inequality. In Sweden, Bara Br√∂st is active in advancing topfreedom, as is Topless Front in Denmark.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Topless_woman_at_the_2008_Oregon_Country_Fair.jpg/220px-Topless_woman_at_the_2008_Oregon_Country_Fair.jpg
