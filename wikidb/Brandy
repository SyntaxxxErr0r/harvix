55.4	Brandy	Brandy	Brandy (from brandywine, derived from Dutch brandewijn—"burnt wine") is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35%–60% alcohol by volume and is typically taken as an after-dinner drink. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, while some are simply coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of such aging (and some brandies are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Martell_in_brandy_snifter.jpg/220px-Martell_in_brandy_snifter.jpg
