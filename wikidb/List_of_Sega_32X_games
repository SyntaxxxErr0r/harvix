Unveiled at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, Sega presented the Sega 32X as the "poor man's entry into 'next generation' games." The 32X was originally conceived as an entirely new console by Sega of Japan, but Sega of America R&amp;D head Joe Miller convinced Sega of Japan to strengthen the console and convert it into an add-on to the existing Sega Mega Drive, Sega's current console. They did not, however, make it a competitor to the forthcoming Sega Saturn. Although this add-on contained two 32-bit central processing unit chips, and a 3D graphics processor, it failed to attract either developers or consumers as the superior Saturn had already been announced for release the next year. Originally released at US$159, Sega dropped the price to $99 in only a few months and ultimately cleared the remaining inventory at $19.95. 665,000 Sega 32X units were sold by the end of 1994.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Sega-Genesis-Model2-32X.jpg/220px-Sega-Genesis-Model2-32X.jpg
