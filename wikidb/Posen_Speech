The recordings are the first known documents in which a high-ranking member of the Nazi government spoke of the on-going extermination of the Jews in extermination camps. They demonstrate that the Nazi government wanted, planned and carried out the Holocaust.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Page_of_Himmler_Posen_Speech%2C_Oct_4%2C_1943.jpg/180px-Page_of_Himmler_Posen_Speech%2C_Oct_4%2C_1943.jpg
