70.1	Geometric_mean	Geometric mean	The arithmetic and geometric means "agree" that computer C is the fastest. However, by presenting appropriately normalized values and using the arithmetic mean, we can show either of the other two computers to be the fastest. Normalizing by A's result gives A as the fastest computer according to the arithmetic mean:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Dr._Kerns_Powers%2C_SMPTE_derivation_of_16-9_aspect_ratio.svg/300px-Dr._Kerns_Powers%2C_SMPTE_derivation_of_16-9_aspect_ratio.svg.png
