Though he ultimately underwent bankruptcy, he was a significant contributor to the shape of the city. Roger Sale, in his book Seattle, Past to Present, described him as having been "the pioneer to turn to if one had a plan that would be 'good for Seattle', and one needed a respectable tone and a willing investor."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/David_T_Denny.jpg/220px-David_T_Denny.jpg
