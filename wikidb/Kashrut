88.1	Kashrut	Kashrut	Kashrut (also kashruth or kashrus, ) is the set of Jewish dietary laws. Food that may be consumed according to halakha (Jewish law) is termed kosher in English, from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew term kash√©r (), meaning "fit" (in this context, fit for consumption). Food that is not in accordance with Jewish law is called treif . Kosher can also refer to anything that is fit for use or correct according to halakha, such as a hanukiyah (candelabra for Hannukah), or a sukkah (a Sukkot booth). The word kosher has become English vernacular, a colloquialism meaning proper, legitimate, genuine, fair, or acceptable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Feetmontage.jpg/250px-Feetmontage.jpg
