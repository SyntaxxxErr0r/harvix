56.6	Phenomenology_(philosophy)	Phenomenology (philosophy)	Phenomenology (from Greek: phainómenon "that which appears"; and lógos "study") is the study of the structure of experience. It is a broad philosophical movement founded in the early years of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl, expanded together with a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany, and which spread across to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.
