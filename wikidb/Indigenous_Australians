100.5	Indigenous_Australians	Indigenous Australians	Indigenous Australians are the original inhabitants of the Australian continent and nearby islands. The Aboriginal Indigenous Australians migrated from India via the "Southern Route" around 50,000 years ago, and arrived in Australia around 45,000 years ago. The Torres Strait Islanders are indigenous to the Torres Strait Islands, which are at the northern-most tip of Queensland near Papua New Guinea. The term "Aboriginal" has traditionally been applied to indigenous inhabitants of mainland Australia, Tasmania, and some of the other adjacent islands.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Bathurst_Island_men.jpg/220px-Bathurst_Island_men.jpg
