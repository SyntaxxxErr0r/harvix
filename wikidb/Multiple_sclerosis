Disease onset usually occurs in young adults, and it is more common in women. It has a prevalence that ranges between 2 and 150 per 100,000. MS was first described in 1868 by Jean-Martin Charcot.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/MS_Demyelinisation_CD68_10xv2.jpg/230px-MS_Demyelinisation_CD68_10xv2.jpg
