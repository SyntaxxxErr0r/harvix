1.21	Levi_Hill	Levi Hill	Levi Hill (born 1816) was an American minister in Upstate New York who claimed to have invented the first color photographic process in 1850. Hill called his process "Heliochromy", though the plates created became commonly referred to as "Hillotypes". Though his work was met with skepticism during his lifetime, subsequent researches have tended to show that his process did in fact have a crude ability to reproduce colors in the natural world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Hillotype.jpg/220px-Hillotype.jpg
