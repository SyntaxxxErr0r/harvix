51.9	Athabasca_oil_sands	Athabasca oil sands	The Athabasca oil sands, historically known as the Athabasca tar sands due to perceived similarities with actual tar, are large deposits of bitumen or extremely heavy crude oil, located in northeastern Alberta, Canada - roughly centred on the boomtown of Fort McMurray. These oil sands, hosted in the McMurray Formation, consist of a mixture of crude bitumen (a semi-solid form of crude oil), silica sand, clay minerals, and water. The Athabasca deposit is the largest known reservoir of crude bitumen in the world and the largest of three major oil sands deposits in Alberta, along with the nearby Peace River and Cold Lake deposits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Athabasca_Oil_Sands_map.png/250px-Athabasca_Oil_Sands_map.png
