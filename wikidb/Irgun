104.5	Irgun	Irgun	The Irgun (Hebrew: ‎), or Irgun Zevai Leumi to give it its full title (from Hebrew: ‎, "The National Military Organization in the Land of Israel"), was a Zionist paramilitary group that operated in Mandate Palestine between 1931 and 1948. It was an offshoot of the earlier and larger Jewish paramilitary organization haHaganah (Hebrew: "The Defense", ההגנה). When the group broke from the Haganah it became known as the Haganah Bet (Hebrew: literally "Defense 'B' " or "Second Defense", ), or alternatively as haHaganah haLeumit () or Ha'ma'amad (‎). Irgun members were absorbed into the Israel Defence Forces at the start of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The Irgun is also referred to as Etzel (), an acronym of the Hebrew initials, or by the abbreviation IZL.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Pantani.jpg/200px-Pantani.jpg
