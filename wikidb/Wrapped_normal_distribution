1.10	Wrapped_normal_distribution	wrapped normal distribution	In probability theory and directional statistics, a wrapped normal distribution is a wrapped probability distribution which results from the "wrapping" of the normal distribution around the unit circle. It finds application in the theory of Brownian motion and is a solution to the heat equation for periodic boundary conditions. It is closely approximated by the von Mises distribution, which, due to its mathematical simplicity and tractability, is the most commonly used distribution in directional statistics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/WrappedNormalPDF.png/325px-WrappedNormalPDF.png
