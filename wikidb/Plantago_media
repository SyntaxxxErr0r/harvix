1.11	Plantago_media	Plantago media	Plantago media, known as the hoary plantain, is a species of genus Plantago native to central and western Europe, including Great Britain and introduced to parts of the north-east United States. Its generic name is derived from the Latin for sole; like other members of Plantago, it should not be confused with the plantain, a starchy banana.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Plantago-media.JPG/220px-Plantago-media.JPG
