109.3	Netscape_Navigator	Netscape Navigator	Netscape Navigator was a proprietary web browser that was popular in the 1990s. It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corporation and the dominant web browser in terms of usage share, although by 2002 its usage had almost disappeared. This was primarily due to the increased usage of Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser software, and partly because the Netscape Corporation (later purchased by AOL) did not sustain Netscape Navigator's technical innovation after the late 1990s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/Netscape_Navigator.png/250px-Netscape_Navigator.png
