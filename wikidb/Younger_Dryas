71.5	Younger_Dryas	Younger Dryas	The Younger Dryas stadial, also referred to as the Big Freeze, was a geologically brief (1,300 Â± 70 years) period of cold climatic conditions and drought which occurred between approximately 12,800 and 11,500 years BP (Before Present). The Younger Dryas stadial is thought to have been caused by the collapse of the North American ice sheets, although rival theories have been proposed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Epica-vostok-grip-40kyr.png/220px-Epica-vostok-grip-40kyr.png
