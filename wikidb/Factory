73.2	Factory	Factory	A factory (previously manufactory) or manufacturing plant is an industrial building where laborers manufacture goods or supervise machines processing one product into another. Most modern factories have large warehouses or warehouse-like facilities that contain heavy equipment used for assembly line production. Typically, factories gather and concentrate resources: laborers, capital and plant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Wolfsburg_VW-Werk.jpg/250px-Wolfsburg_VW-Werk.jpg
