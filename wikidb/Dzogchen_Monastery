4.12	Dzogchen_Monastery	Dzogchen Monastery	Dzogchen Monastery (Tib. rdzogs chen dgon pa) is one of the six great monasteries of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. It is located in Sichuan province, China, and marks part of the Tibetan cultural region of Kham. It was founded by Dzogchen Pema Rigdzin (1625-1697) in 1675, 1684 or 1685. It became especially renowned for its Shri Singha Shedra established by Gyalsé Shenpen Thayé during the time of the Fourth Dzogchen Rinpoche Mingyur Namkhé Dorje, shortly after the monastery was almost totally destroyed by an earthquake in 1842. Among the great masters to have lived and taught at Dzogchen are Khenpo Pema Vajra, Patrul Rinpoche, Mipham Rinpoche and Khenpo Shenga. It eventually grew into the largest Nyingma monastery of all time.
