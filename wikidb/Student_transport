3.11	Student_transport	Student transport	In Hong Kong, younger students are transported between their homes and schools by "nanny vans". These vehicles are typically van-based and are smaller than a typical Hong Kong public light bus. When nanny vans originated, they were regulated primarily by the schools and the van drivers. Today, in the interest of safety, nanny vans are government-regulated vehicles that run on fixed routes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Busabout_3951_MO_-_PMC_bodied_Mercedes-Benz_O405_%28Ex_Moorabbin_Transit%29.jpg/200px-Busabout_3951_MO_-_PMC_bodied_Mercedes-Benz_O405_%28Ex_Moorabbin_Transit%29.jpg
