52.7	Australian_Shepherd	Australian Shepherd	The Australian shepherd is a breed of a herding dog that was developed on ranches in western United States, originating on a ranch in Boulder, Colorado. Despite its name, the breed, commonly known as an Aussie, did not originate in Australia and is American. They acquired their name because some of these dogs were used to herd Australian sheep. The breed rose gradually in popularity with the boom of western riding after World War I. They became known to the general public through rodeos, horse shows, and through Disney movies made for television.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Redtriaussie01.jpg/220px-Redtriaussie01.jpg
