The Swedish Royal Academies stated, when awarding the prize, that he "has done more than any other contemporary economist to raise the level of scientific analysis in economic theory." Economic historian Randall E. Parker calls him the "Father of Modern Economics", and The New York Times considered him to be the "foremost academic economist of the 20th century."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Samuelson1950.jpg/220px-Samuelson1950.jpg
