1.00	Pipiolos	Pipiolos	Pipiolos was the name used to refer to Chilean upper class liberals in early 19th century. The name Pipiolo was originally used by the Pelucones or conservatives in a despective maner by associating the liberals to inexperience. In the Chilean Civil War of 1829 the Pipiolos led by Ram√≥n Freire were defeated and the Pelucones could triumphantly enforce the Chilean Constitution of 1833 which led to creation of a strong unitarian and authoritarian presidentialist system held up by upper-class democracy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/RamonFreire.jpg/180px-RamonFreire.jpg
