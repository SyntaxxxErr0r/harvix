91.2	Sovereignty	Sovereignty	Sovereignty is the quality of having supreme, independent authority over a geographic area, such as a territory. It can be found in a power to rule and make law that rests on a political fact for which no purely legal explanation can be provided. In theoretical terms, the idea of "sovereignty", historically, from Socrates to Thomas Hobbes, has always necessitated a moral imperative on the entity exercising it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Leviathan_gr.jpg/200px-Leviathan_gr.jpg
