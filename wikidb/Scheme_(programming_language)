161.5	Scheme_(programming_language)	Scheme (programming language)	Scheme is a functional programming language and one of the two main dialects of the programming language Lisp. Unlike Common Lisp, the other main dialect, Scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy specifying a small standard core with powerful tools for language extension. Its compactness and elegance have made it popular with educators, language designers, programmers, implementors, and hobbyists. The language's diverse appeal is seen as a strong point, though the consequently wide divergence between implementations is seen as one of the language's weak points.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Lambda_lc.svg/100px-Lambda_lc.svg.png
