51.8	Stephen_Decatur	Stephen Decatur	Stephen Decatur, Jr. , (January 5, 1779 â€“ March 22, 1820) was an American naval officer notable for his many naval victories in the early 19th century. He was born on the eastern shore of Maryland, Worcester county, the son of a U.S. Naval Officer who served during the American Revolution. Shortly after attending college Decatur followed in his father's footsteps and joined the U.S. Navy at the age of 19. He was the youngest man to reach the rank of captain in the history of the United States Navy. Decatur's father, Stephen Decatur, Sr., also became a Commodore in the U.S. Navy - which brought the younger Stephen into the world of ships and sailing early on. Decatur supervised the construction of several U.S. naval vessels, one of which he would later command. He became an affluent member of Washington society and counted James Monroe and other Washington dignitaries among his personal friends.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/StephenDecatur.jpeg/220px-StephenDecatur.jpeg
