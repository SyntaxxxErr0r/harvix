83.9	Little_black_dress	Little black dress	A little black dress is an evening or cocktail dress, cut simply and often quite short. Fashion historians ascribe the origins of the little black dress to the 1920s designs of Coco Chanel, intended to be long-lasting, versatile, affordable, accessible to the widest market possible and in a neutral color. Its ubiquity is such that it is often simply referred to as the "LBD."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Anneke_Gr%C3%B6nloh_1964_Eurovision_dress.jpg/220px-Anneke_Gr%C3%B6nloh_1964_Eurovision_dress.jpg
