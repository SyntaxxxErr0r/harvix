Many are music majors, majoring in the instrument they have been contracted to play. In addition to performing in the CLOC theatre productions, the orchestra holds its own "Sunday Soiree", a chamber concert hosted by the College Light Opera Chamber Orchestra and the Cape Cod Conservatory. These concerts were started in the early 1990s by John and Avery Funkhouser and were initially held in the main hall of the West Falmouth Library until moving to the recital hall of the Cape Cod Conservatory in 2006. Summer 2008 marked the CLOC Chamber Orchestra's first symphonic concert with a performance of Schubert's Symphony No. 1 in D Major.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Llanerchaeron_house_and_church%2C_Wales.JPG/200px-Llanerchaeron_house_and_church%2C_Wales.JPG
