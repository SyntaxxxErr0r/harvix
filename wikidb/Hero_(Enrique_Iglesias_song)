8.60	Hero_(Enrique_Iglesias_song)	Hero (Enrique Iglesias song)	"Hero" is a single released by Enrique Iglesias from his second English album Escape and was written for his good friend Simon Baxendale, by Iglesias, Paul Barry and Mark Taylor. Enrique first released the song to radio in early September 2001 to a positive critical and commercial reception. After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the song was one of the few songs chosen by radio DJs in New York to be remixed with audio from police, firefighters, civilians at Ground Zero and politicians commenting on the attacks. He was asked to sing the song live at the benefit concert America: A Tribute to Heroes ten days after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Iglesias broadcast his performance from a warehouse in New York alongside Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and Sheryl Crow. The location of the warehouse was kept secret in case of further attacks. It was Iglesias' first televised performance of the song. He had performed the song earlier at that year's Miss Venezuela but due to the terrorist attacks the show was not aired on television. Hero has sold 8 million copies worldwide, becoming Enrique's best selling single and has been listed in best selling singles worldwide. It was also covered by Glee in" The Spanish Teacher" episode.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/04/Enrique_-_Hero.jpg/220px-Enrique_-_Hero.jpg
