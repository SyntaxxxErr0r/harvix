93.7	OpenSocial	OpenSocial	OpenSocial is public specification that defines a component hosting environment (container) and a set of common application programming interfaces (APIs) for web-based applications. Initially it was designed for social network applications and was developed by Google along with MySpace and a number of other social networks. In more recent times it has become adopted as a general use runtime environment for allowing untrusted and partially trusted components from third parties to run in an existing web application. The OpenSocial Foundation has also moved to integrate or support numerous other so-called open web technologies. This includes Oauth and OAuth 2.0, Activity Streams, and portable contacts, among others.
