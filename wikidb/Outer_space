74.1	Outer_space	Outer space	Outer space, or simply space, is the void that exists between celestial bodies, including the Earth. It is not completely empty, but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles: predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, and neutrinos. Theory suggests that it also contains dark matter and dark energy. In the space between galaxies, matter density can be as low as a few atoms of hydrogen per cubic meter. The baseline temperature, as set by background radiation left over from the Big Bang, is only 3 Kelvin; in contrast, temperatures in the coronae of stars can reach over a million Kelvin. Plasma with an extremely low density and high temperature, such as warm-hot intergalactic medium and intracluster medium, accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in outer space; local concentrations have evolved into stars and galaxies. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space. As of yet, space travel has been limited to the vicinity of the Solar System; the remainder of outer space remains inaccessible to humans other than by passive observation with telescopes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Atmosphere_layers-en.svg/220px-Atmosphere_layers-en.svg.png
