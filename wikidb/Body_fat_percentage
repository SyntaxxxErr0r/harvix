81.1	Body_fat_percentage	Body fat percentage	A person's body fat percentage is the total weight of the person's fat divided by the person's weight and consists of essential body fat and storage body fat. Essential body fat is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions. The percentage of essential body fat for women is greater than that for men, due to the demands of childbearing and other hormonal functions. The percentage of essential fat is 3%–5% in men, and 8–12% in women. Storage body fat consists of fat accumulation in adipose tissue, part of which protects internal organs in the chest and abdomen. The minimum recommended total body fat percentage exceeds the essential fat percentage value reported above. A number of online tools are available for calculating estimated body fat percentage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Adult_body_composition_through_air_displacement_plethysmography.jpg/220px-Adult_body_composition_through_air_displacement_plethysmography.jpg
