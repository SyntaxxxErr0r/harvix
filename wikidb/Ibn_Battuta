85.0	Ibn_Battuta	Ibn Battuta	(Arabic: ‎), or simply Ibn Battuta (), also known as Shams ad-Din (February 25, 1304 – 1368 or 1369), was a Muslim Berber Moroccan explorer, known for his extensive travels published in the Rihla (lit. "Journey"). Over a period of thirty years, he visited most of the known Islamic world, including North Africa, the Horn of Africa, West Africa, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe in the West, to the Middle East, South Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia and China in the East, a distance surpassing his near-contemporary Marco Polo. Ibn Battuta is considered one of the greatest travellers of all time. He journeyed more than 75,000 miles (121,000 km), a figure unsurpassed by any individual explorer until the coming of the Steam Age some 450 years later.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/IbnBattatuEffendi.jpg/220px-IbnBattatuEffendi.jpg
