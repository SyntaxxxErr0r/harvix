59.5	Washing_machine	Washing machine	A washing machine is a machine designed to wash laundry, such as clothing, towels and sheets. The term is mostly applied only to machines that use water as the primary cleaning solution, as opposed to dry cleaning (which uses alternative cleaning fluids, and is performed by specialist businesses) or even ultrasonic cleaners. The definition of washing is "To cleanse, using water or other liquid, usually with soap, detergent, or bleach, by immersing, dipping, rubbing, or scrubbing". The term machine "A device consisting of fixed and moving parts that modifies mechanical energy and transmits it in a more useful form".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/LGwashingmachine.jpg/220px-LGwashingmachine.jpg
