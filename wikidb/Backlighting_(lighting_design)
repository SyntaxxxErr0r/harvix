23.63	Backlighting_(lighting_design)	Backlighting (lighting design)	Backlighting refers to the process of illuminating the subject from the back. In other words, the lighting instrument and the viewer are facing towards each other, with the subject in between. This causes the edges of the subject to glow, while the other areas remain darker. The backlight can be a natural or artificial source of light. When artificial, the back light is usually placed directly behind the subject in a 4-point lighting setup.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Three_Persons_Viewing_the_Gladiator_by_Candlelight.jpg/220px-Three_Persons_Viewing_the_Gladiator_by_Candlelight.jpg
