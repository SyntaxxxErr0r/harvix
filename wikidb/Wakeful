1.10	Wakeful	Wakefulness	Wakefulness is a daily recurring brain state and state of consciousness in which an individual is conscious and engages in coherent cognitive and behavior responses to the external world such as communication, ambulation, nutritional ingestion and procreation. Being awake is the opposite of the state of being asleep in which most external inputs to the brain are excluded from neural processing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/The_Awakening_by_J._Seward_Johnson.jpg/240px-The_Awakening_by_J._Seward_Johnson.jpg
