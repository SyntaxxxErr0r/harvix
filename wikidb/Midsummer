134.3	Midsummer	Midsummer	Midsummer may simply refer to the period of time centered upon the summer solstice, but more often refers to specific European celebrations that accompany the actual solstice, or that take place on a day between June 21 and June 24, and the preceding evening. The exact dates vary between different cultures. Midsummer is especially important in the cultures of Scandinavia and Latvia where it is the most celebrated holiday apart from Christmas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Midsummer_bonfire.jpg/225px-Midsummer_bonfire.jpg
