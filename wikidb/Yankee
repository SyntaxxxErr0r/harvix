51.3	Yankee	Yankee	The term Yankee (sometimes shortened to Yank) has several interrelated meanings, referring to people from the United States. Outside the US it is used to refer to people from the US in general, whereas within the US it refers to people originating in the northeastern US, or still more narrowly New England, where application of the term is largely restricted to descendants of the English settlers of the region.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Boston1775.jpg/350px-Boston1775.jpg
