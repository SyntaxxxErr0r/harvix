1.00	Milk_tooth	Deciduous teeth	Deciduous teeth, otherwise known as reborner teeth, baby teeth, temporary teeth and primary teeth, are the first set of teeth in the growth development of humans and many other mammals. In some Asian countries they are referred to as fall teeth as they will eventually fall out, while in almost all European languages they are called milk teeth. They develop during the embryonic stage of development and erupt—that is, they become visible in the mouth—during infancy. They are usually lost and replaced by permanent teeth, but in the absence of permanent replacements, they can remain functional for many years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Deciduous_teeth_by_David_Shankbone.jpg/250px-Deciduous_teeth_by_David_Shankbone.jpg
