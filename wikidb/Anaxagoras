51.6	Anaxagoras	Anaxagoras	Anaxagoras (Greek: , "lord of the assembly"; c. 500 BC â€“ 428 BC) was a Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. Born in Clazomenae in Asia Minor, Anaxagoras was the first philosopher to bring philosophy from Ionia to Athens. He attempted to give a scientific account of eclipses, meteors, rainbows, and the sun, which he described as a fiery mass larger than the Peloponnese. According to Diogenes Laertius and Plutarch he fled to Lampsacus due to a backlash against his pupil Pericles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Anaxagoras_Lebiedzki_Rahl.jpg/200px-Anaxagoras_Lebiedzki_Rahl.jpg
