It lies between the Wiehen Hills to the north, the Teutoburg Forest to the south, the state border with Lower Saxony to the west and the large bend in the River Weser and the boundary of Lippe district to the east. It thus essentially encompasses the Westphalian part of the Ravensberg Hills. The most important towns are Bielefeld (northern and central quarters), Herford, Bad Oeynhausen and BÃ¼nde.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Lage_Ravensberger_Land.png/130px-Lage_Ravensberger_Land.png
