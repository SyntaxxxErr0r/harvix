2.40	Savannah_Town,_South_Carolina	Savannah Town, South Carolina	Savannah Town, South Carolina was first observed in the 1670s as a Westo village, located on the Savannah River below the fall line in present day Aiken County. The Savannah (Shawnee) displaced the Westos in a 1679-1680 trade war, and the town bore their name on a 1685 Joel Gascoyne Plat of the Province of Carolina (Cumming #101). Savannah Town became important to the growing colony for its profitable Indian trade, and for frontier defense.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/CentralSavannahRiver1775.jpg/350px-CentralSavannahRiver1775.jpg
