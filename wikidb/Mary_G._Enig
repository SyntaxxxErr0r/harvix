She has promoted skepticism towards the widely held view in the medical community that high saturated fat diets lead to heart disease, while she advocates for a diet based on whole foods and rich in certain saturated fats, such as those found in coconut oil and butter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Dr_Enig.jpg
