55.7	Government_debt	Government debt	Government debt (also known as public debt, national debt) is the debt owed by a central government. (In the U.S. and other federal states, "government debt" may also refer to the debt of a state or provincial government, municipal or local government.) By contrast, the annual "government deficit" refers to the difference between government receipts and spending in a single year, that is, the increase of debt over a particular year.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Government-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg/220px-Government-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg
