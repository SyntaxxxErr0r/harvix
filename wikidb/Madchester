72.6	Madchester	Madchester	In May, the Happy Mondays released the single "Lazyitis" and the Inspiral Carpets put out their first single with new singer Tom Hingley, "Joe". Like the Stone Roses, the Inspiral Carpets were producing sixties-inspired indie music. These bands mixed disco basslines and wah-wah guitar with their indie jingle-jangle. The Inspiral Carpets added the sound of the Farfisa organ.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Madch.jpg/220px-Madch.jpg
