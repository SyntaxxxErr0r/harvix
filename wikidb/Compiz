102.1	Compiz	Compiz	Compiz is one of the early compositing window managers for the X Window System that uses 3D graphics hardware to create fast compositing desktop effects for window management. The effects, such as a minimization effect and a cube workspace are implemented as loadable plugins. Because it conforms to the ICCCM standard, Compiz can be used as a substitute for the default Mutter or Metacity respectively when using GNOME Panel or KWin in KDE Plasma Workspaces.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Compiz_logo.svg/200px-Compiz_logo.svg.png
