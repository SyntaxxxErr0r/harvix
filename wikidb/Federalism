94.6	Federalism	Federalism	Federalism is a political concept in which a group of members are bound together by covenant (Latin: foedus, covenant) with a governing representative head. The term "federalism" is also used to describe a system of the government in which sovereignty is constitutionally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units (like states or provinces). Federalism is a system based upon democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a federation. Proponents are often called federalists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Map_of_federal_states.svg/300px-Map_of_federal_states.svg.png
