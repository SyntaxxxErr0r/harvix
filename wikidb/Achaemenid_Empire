77.1	Achaemenid_Empire	Achaemenid Empire	The Achaemenid Empire (c. 550â€“330 BCE), sometimes known as First Persian Empire, was an empire in Southwest Asia, founded in the 6th century BCE by Cyrus the Great who overthrew the Median confederation. It expanded to eventually rule over significant portions of the ancient world which at around 500 BCE stretched from the Indus Valley in the east, to Thrace and Macedon on the northeastern border of Greece making it the biggest empire the world had yet seen. The Achaemenid Empire would eventually control Egypt as well. It was ruled by a series of monarchs who unified its disparate tribes and nationalities by constructing a complex network of roads.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Standard_of_Cyrus_the_Great_%28White%29.svg/125px-Standard_of_Cyrus_the_Great_%28White%29.svg.png
