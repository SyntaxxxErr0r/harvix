71.6	Cardamom	Cardamom	Cardamom (or cardamon) refers to several plants of the genera Elettaria and Amomum in the ginger family Zingiberaceae. Both genera are native to India, Nepal and Bhutan; they are recognised by their small seed pod, triangular in cross-section and spindle-shaped, with a thin papery outer shell and small black seeds. Today, the majority of cardamom is still grown in southern India, although some other countries, such as Guatemala and Sri Lanka, have also begun to cultivate it. Elettaria pods are light green while Amomum pods are larger and dark brown.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Elettaria_cardamomum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-057.jpg/220px-Elettaria_cardamomum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-057.jpg
