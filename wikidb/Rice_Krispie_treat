6.10	Rice_Krispie_treat	Rice Krispies Treats	'Rice Krispies Treats (also called Rice Krispies squares, bars, buns or cakes) are a sweet dessert or snack made from Rice Krispies, melted butter or margarine, and melted marshmallows. Sometimes marshmallows and/or cereal that is seasonal is used to make these treats holiday-specific. While they can be made at home, they can be purchased in stores, usually packaged under the Rice Krispies brand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/RKTsquares.jpg/220px-RKTsquares.jpg
