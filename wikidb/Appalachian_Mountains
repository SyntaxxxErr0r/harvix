94.1	Appalachian_Mountains	Appalachian Mountains	The Appalachian Mountains , often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period, and were once among the tallest mountains in the world before erosion wore them down. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to any road running east-west.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/MonNatForest.jpg/256px-MonNatForest.jpg
