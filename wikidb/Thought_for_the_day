Nowadays lasting 2 minutes and 45 seconds, it is a successor to the more substantial five-minute religious sequence Ten to Eight (1965â€“1970) and, before that, Lift Up Your Hearts, which was first broadcast five mornings a week on the BBC Home Service from December 1939, initially at 7.30, though soon moved to 7.47.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Thoughtfortheday.jpg/200px-Thoughtfortheday.jpg
