54.1	Diamond_Head,_Hawaii	Diamond Head, Hawaii	Diamond Head is the name of a volcanic tuff cone on the Hawaiian island of Oahu and known to Hawaiians as LÄ“ahi, most likely from lae 'browridge, promontory' plus ahi 'tuna' because the shape of the ridgeline resembles the shape of a tuna's dorsal fin. Its English name was given by British sailors in the 19th century, who mistook calcite crystals embedded in the rock for diamonds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Diamond_Head_Hawaii_From_Round_Top_Rd.JPG/280px-Diamond_Head_Hawaii_From_Round_Top_Rd.JPG
