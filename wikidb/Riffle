7.10	Riffle	Riffle	A Riffle is a short, relatively shallow and coarse-bedded length of stream over which the stream flows at higher velocity and higher turbulence than it normally does in comparison to a pool. As a result of the lower velocity and heightened turbulence, small ripples are frequently found. Riffles are usually caused by an increase in a stream bed's slope or an obstruction in the water.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/%D0%A8%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0.jpg/300px-%D0%A8%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0.jpg
