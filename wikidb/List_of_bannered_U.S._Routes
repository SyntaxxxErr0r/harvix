1.20	List_of_bannered_U.S._Routes	List of bannered U.S. Routes	A bannered U.S. Route (occasionally/neologistically auxiliary U.S. Route) is a term coined by roadfans to define special routes of the United States Numbered Highway system. Bannered U.S. routes, as the name suggests, are typically marked with an auxiliary sign (or "banner") above (or occasionally below) the route shield, or a suffix letter after the number in the shield. Occasionally the name of the special route type will be placed on the shield itself, as is in the case of US 13 Business in Maryland.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Banneredhighways.svg/290px-Banneredhighways.svg.png
