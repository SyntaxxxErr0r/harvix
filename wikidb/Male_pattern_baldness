15.76	Male_pattern_baldness	Androgenic alopecia	Androgenic alopecia (also known as androgenetic alopecia or alopecia androgenetica) is the most common cause of hair loss and thinning in humans. Variants appear in both men and women. Androgenic alopecia also occurs in chimpanzee and orangutans. In humans, this condition is also commonly known as male pattern baldness. In classic pattern baldness, hair is lost in a well-defined pattern, beginning above both temples. Hair also thins at the crown of the head. Often a rim of hair around the sides and rear of the head is left. This type of pattern is dubbed "Hippocratic balding" and may rarely progress to complete baldness. Women do not suffer classic male pattern baldness, instead the hair becomes thinner around the whole scalp, and the hairline does not recede. This is dubbed "female pattern baldness" and may occur in males. This variety of androgenic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Alopecia.jpg/230px-Alopecia.jpg
