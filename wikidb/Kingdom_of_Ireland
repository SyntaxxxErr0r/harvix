36.86	Kingdom_of_Ireland	Kingdom of Ireland	The Kingdom of Ireland (Irish: ) refers to the country of Ireland in the period between the proclamation of Henry VIII as King of Ireland by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 and the Act of Union in 1800. It replaced the Lordship of Ireland, which had been created in 1171. King Henry VIII was recognised as monarch of Ireland by some Protestant powers in Europe, although not by the Catholic monarchies in Europe. However his daughter Mary I was recognised as Queen of Ireland by the pope in 1555. The separate Kingdom of Ireland ceased to exist when Ireland joined with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Ireland_in_the_United_Kingdom.png/250px-Ireland_in_the_United_Kingdom.png
