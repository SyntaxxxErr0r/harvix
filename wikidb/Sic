82.3	Sic	Sic	The Latin adverb sic added immediately after a quoted word or phrase (or a longer piece of text), indicates that the quoted words have been transcribed exactly as spelled or presented in the original source, complete with any erroneous spelling or other presentation. The usual purpose is to inform the reader that any errors or apparent errors in the transcribed material do not arise from transcription errors, and the errors have been repeated intentionally, i.e. that they are reproduced exactly as set down by the original writer or printer. Sic is generally placed inside square brackets, or in parentheses (round brackets), and traditionally in italic, as is customary when printing a foreign word. Sic may also be used as a form of ridicule or as a humorous comment, drawing attention to the original writer's spelling-mistakes and emphasizing his or her erroneous logic.
