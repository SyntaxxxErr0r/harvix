58.0	Pasty	Pasty	A pasty ( , Cornish: ), sometimes known as a pastie or British pasty in the United States, is a filled pastry case, associated in particular with Cornwall in Great Britain. It is made by placing the uncooked filling on a flat pastry circle, and folding it to wrap the filling, crimping the edge at the side or top to form a seal. The result is a raised semicircular package.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Cornish_pasty.jpeg/300px-Cornish_pasty.jpeg
