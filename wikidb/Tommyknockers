1.10	Tommyknockers	Knocker (folklore)	The Knocker, Knacker, Bwca , Bucca (Cornish) or Tommyknocker (US) is a mythical creature in Welsh and Cornish folklore. They are the equivalent of Irish leprechauns and English and Scottish brownies. About two feet tall and grizzled, but not misshapen, they live beneath the ground. Here they wear tiny versions of standard miner's garb and commit random mischief, such as stealing miner's unattended tools and food.
