2.00	Diamond_Coast	Sperrgebiet	The Sperrgebiet is a diamond mining area in south-western Namibia, in the Namib Desert. It spans the Atlantic Ocean-facing coast from Oranjemund on the border with South Africa, to around 45 miles (72 km) north of Lüderitz, a distance of 320 km (200 mi) north. The Sperrgebiet extends to around 100 km (62 mi) inland, and its total area of 26,000 km², or 10,400 square miles, makes up three percent of Namibia's land mass. However, mining only takes place in five percent of the Sperrgebiet, with most of the area acting as a buffer zone. Members of the public are banned from entering most of the area, despite the creation of a national park there in 2004.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Sperrgebiet-001.jpg/220px-Sperrgebiet-001.jpg
