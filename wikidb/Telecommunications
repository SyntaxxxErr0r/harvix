119.6	Telecommunications	Telecommunication	Telecommunication is the transmission of information over significant distances to communicate. In earlier times, telecommunications involved the use of visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs, or audio messages via coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, or sent by loud whistles, for example. In the modern age of electricity and electronics, telecommunications now also includes the use of electrical devices such as the telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, as well as the use of radio and microwave communications, as well as fiber optics and their associated electronics, plus the use of the orbiting satellites and the Internet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Erdfunkstelle_Raisting_2.jpg/220px-Erdfunkstelle_Raisting_2.jpg
