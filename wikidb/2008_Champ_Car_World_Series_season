It was scheduled to begin on April 20, 2008 and end on November 9. The season, with the sole exception of the Long Beach Grand Prix (won by Will Power), was canceled February 21, 2008 because of the buyout of Champ Car by the rival Indy Racing League. However, the Rexall Grand Prix of Edmonton and the Gold Coast Indy 300 were retained and transferred to the Indy Car Series schedule.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/2007CCWSlogo.png/180px-2007CCWSlogo.png
