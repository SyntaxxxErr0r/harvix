65.9	Catherine,_Duchess_of_Cambridge	Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge	Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (Catherine Elizabeth "Kate"; n√©e Middleton; born 9 January 1982) is the wife of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. The Duke of Cambridge is second in line to the thrones of the sixteen Commonwealth realms and, should he eventually become king (as is expected), she would automatically become his queen consort. Catherine grew up in Chapel Row at Bucklebury, a village near Newbury, Berkshire, England. She studied in Scotland at the University of St Andrews, where she met the then Prince William of Wales in 2001.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Badge_of_the_House_of_Windsor.svg/120px-Badge_of_the_House_of_Windsor.svg.png
