6.10	Oldest_Dryas	Oldest Dryas	The Oldest Dryas was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest stadial after the Weichselian glaciation in north Europe. In the Alps, the Oldest Dryas corresponds to the Gschnitz stadial of the Würm glaciation. The three “Dryas” periods (younger, older, oldest) are named for a marker species, Dryas octopetala, detected in core samples of glacial ice and peat bogs. The Oldest Dryas corresponds to pollen zone Ia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Alpine_valley.jpg/220px-Alpine_valley.jpg
