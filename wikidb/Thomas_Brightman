4.10	Thomas_Brightman	Thomas Brightman	Thomas Brightman (1562–1607) was an English clergyman and biblical commentator. His exegesis of the Book of Revelation, published posthumously, proved influential. According to William M. Lamont, Brightman and Joseph Mede were the two most important “revisionists” of the interpretation and eschatology set down by John Foxe; among Brightman's contributions was to weaken the imperial associations tied to the Emperor Constantine I. The detailed reading, in favour of the Genevan and Scottish churches, and condemning the ‘Laodicean’ (lukewarm) Church of England, helped to move on the Puritan conceptions of church reform and its urgency.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Thomas_Brightman.jpg
