Although the league is officially affiliated to the United States Adult Soccer Association (USASA), and qualifies for the US Open Cup through USASA channels, the league is generally considered to be at the fourth tier of competition in the American Soccer Pyramid, behind Major League Soccer, the North American Soccer League, and the Canadian Soccer League and roughly equal with the USL Premier Development League and the National Premier Soccer League.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/26/Pcsllogo.png/150px-Pcsllogo.png
