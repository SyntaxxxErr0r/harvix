255.7	Sudan	Sudan	Sudan , officially the Republic of the Sudan (Arabic: ‎, Jumhūrīyat as-Sūdān), sometimes called North Sudan, is a country in eastern North Africa (sometimes also considered to be part of the Maghreb or the Middle East). It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Eritrea and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west, and Libya to the northwest. The population of Sudan is a combination of indigenous Nilo-Saharan-speaking Africans, and descendants of migrants from the Arabian Peninsula. Due to the process of Arabisation common throughout the rest of the Arab World, today Arab culture predominates in Sudan. The majority of the population of Sudan adheres to Islam. The Nile divides the country between east and west sides.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Flag_of_Sudan.svg/125px-Flag_of_Sudan.svg.png
