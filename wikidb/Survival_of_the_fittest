61.1	Survival_of_the_fittest	Survival of the fittest	"Survival of the fittest" is a phrase originating in evolutionary theory, as an alternative description of natural selection. The phrase is today commonly used in contexts that are incompatible with the original meaning as intended by its first two proponents: British polymath philosopher Herbert Spencer (who coined the term) and Charles Darwin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Spencer1.jpg/195px-Spencer1.jpg
