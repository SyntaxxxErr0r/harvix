55.8	Doha_Development_Round	Doha Development Round	The Doha Development Round or Doha Development Agenda is the current trade-negotiation round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which commenced in November 2001. Its objective is to lower trade barriers around the world, which will help facilitate the increase of global trade. As of 2008, talks have stalled over a divide on major issues, such as agriculture, industrial tariffs and non-tariff barriers, services, and trade remedies. The most significant differences are between developed nations led by the European Union (EU), the United States (USA), and Japan and the major developing countries led and represented mainly by Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and South Africa. There is also considerable contention against and between the EU and the USA over their maintenance of agricultural subsidiesâ€”seen to operate effectively as trade barriers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/HK_convention_center.jpg/220px-HK_convention_center.jpg
