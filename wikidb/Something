36.64	Something	Something	"Something" is a song by The Beatles featured on their 1969 album Abbey Road. It was also released as Double A-sided single with "Come Together". "Something" was the first Beatles song written by lead guitarist George Harrison to appear as an A-side, and the only song written by him to top the US charts while he was in the band. The single was also one of the first Beatles singles to contain tracks already available on a long playing (LP) album, as both songs appeared on Abbey Road.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Come_Together-Something_%28single_cover%29.jpg/220px-Come_Together-Something_%28single_cover%29.jpg
