94.6	Carbon_sequestration	Carbon sequestration	Biosequestration or carbon sequestration through biological processes affects the global carbon cycle. Examples include major climatic fluctuations, such as the Azolla event, which created the current Arctic climate. Such processes created fossil fuels, as well as clathrate or limestone. By manipulating such processes, geoengineers seek to enhance sequestration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Phytoplankton_SoAtlantic_20060215.jpg/170px-Phytoplankton_SoAtlantic_20060215.jpg
