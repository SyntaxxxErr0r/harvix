After the Second World War, its location happened to lie within the borders of East Germany, whereupon it became one of the most important trade fairs of Comecon and was traditionally a meeting place for businessmen and politicians from both sides of the Iron Curtain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Double_M_-_Symbol_of_the_Leipzig_fair.jpg/150px-Double_M_-_Symbol_of_the_Leipzig_fair.jpg
