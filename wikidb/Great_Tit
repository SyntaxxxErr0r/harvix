63.7	Great_Tit	Great Tit	The Great Tit is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common species throughout Europe, the Middle East, Central and Northern Asia, and parts of North Africa in any sort of woodland. It is generally resident, and most Great Tits do not migrate except in extremely harsh winters. Until 2005 this species was lumped with numerous other subspecies. DNA studies have shown these other subspecies to be distinctive from the Great Tit and these have now been separated as two separate species, the Cinereous Tit of southern Asia, and the Japanese Tit of East Asia. The Great Tit remains the most widespread species in the genus Parus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Parus_major_2_Luc_Viatour.jpg/250px-Parus_major_2_Luc_Viatour.jpg
