2.11	Tomb_of_King_Muryeong	Tomb of King Muryeong	The Tomb of King Muryeong, also known as Songsan-ri Tomb No. 7, is the ancient tumulus of King Muryeong, who ruled the Baekje Kingdom from 501 to 523, and his queen. The rarity of intact Baekje tombs makes this one of the major archaeological discoveries in Korea and a crucial source for the understanding of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms (Kim 1973, 1986; Kim and Pearson 1977).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Muryeong_Tomb_niche.jpg/220px-Muryeong_Tomb_niche.jpg
