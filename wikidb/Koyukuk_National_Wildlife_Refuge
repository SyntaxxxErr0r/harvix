This region of wetlands is home to fish, waterfowl, beaver and moose, and wooded lowlands where bears, wolves, lynx and marten prowl. The 750,000-acre (3,000 km2) Northern Unit of the Innoko National Wildlife Refuge, commonly known as Kaiyuh Flats, is managed as part of the Koyukuk/Nowitna Refuge Complex. Rich in wetlands, the Northern Innoko is an extremely productive breeding area for migratory waterfowl and fish. The streams and rivers of the refuge complex support three species of salmon, arctic grayling, sheefish, and many other fish species. Northern pike, especially those that winter in the shallow lakes of the Northern Innoko National Wildlife Refuge, sometimes grow to record size.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Lower_Koyukuk_River_-_aerial_-_P1040597.JPG/284px-Lower_Koyukuk_River_-_aerial_-_P1040597.JPG
