64.0	JPEG_2000	JPEG 2000	JPEG 2000 is an image compression standard and coding system. It was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 2000 with the intention of superseding their original discrete cosine transform-based JPEG standard (created in 1992) with a newly designed, wavelet-based method. The standardized filename extension is .jp2 for ISO/IEC 15444-1 conforming files and .jpx for the extended part-2 specifications, published as ISO/IEC 15444-2. The registered MIME types are defined in RFC 3745. For ISO/IEC 15444-1 it is image/jp2.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/JPEG_JFIF_and_2000_Comparison.png/300px-JPEG_JFIF_and_2000_Comparison.png
