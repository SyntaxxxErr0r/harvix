2.10	Laser_Hair_Removal	Laser hair removal	Laser hair removal was performed experimentally for about 20 years before it became commercially available in the mid 1990s. One of the first published articles describing laser hair removal was authored by the group at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1998. The efficacy of laser hair removal is now generally accepted in the dermatology community, and laser hair removal is widely practiced in clinics, and even in homes use devices designed and priced for consumer self-treatment. Many reviews of laser hair removal methods, safety, and efficacy have been published in the dermatology literature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Hair_removal_laser_-_Cynosure_Apogee_Elite.jpg/220px-Hair_removal_laser_-_Cynosure_Apogee_Elite.jpg
