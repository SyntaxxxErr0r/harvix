52.7	Zolpidem	Zolpidem	Zolpidem is a prescription medication used for the treatment of insomnia, as well as some brain disorders. It is a short-acting nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class that potentiates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, by binding to GABAA receptors at the same location as benzodiazepines. It works quickly (usually within 15 minutes) and has a short half-life (2â€“3 hours).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Zolpidem_structure_simple.svg/240px-Zolpidem_structure_simple.svg.png
