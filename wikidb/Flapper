52.1	Flapper	Flapper	"Flappers" in the 1920s was a term applied to a "new breed" of young Western women who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Louise_Brooks_ggbain_32453u_crop.jpg/177px-Louise_Brooks_ggbain_32453u_crop.jpg
