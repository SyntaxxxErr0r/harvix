The MRE replaced the canned MCI or Meal, Combat, Individual rations in 1981 and is the intended successor to the lighter LRP ration developed by the United States Army for Special Forces and Ranger patrol units in Vietnam.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/MRE_20071124.PNG/250px-MRE_20071124.PNG
