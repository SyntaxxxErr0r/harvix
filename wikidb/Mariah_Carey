113.8	Mariah_Carey	Mariah Carey	Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. She made her recording debut in 1990 under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, and released her self-titled debut studio album, Mariah Carey. The album went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles, on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993, a series of hit records, including Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993) and Merry Christmas (1994), established her position as Columbia's highest-selling act. Daydream (1995), made music history when the second single, "One Sweet Day" a duet with Boyz II Men, spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, and remains the longest running number one song in US chart history. During the recording of the album Carey began to deviate from her pop background, and slowly traversed into R&amp;B and Hip-hop. After her separation from Mottola, this musical change was evident with the release of Butterfly (1997).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Mariah_Carey_2_by_David_Shankbone.jpg/220px-Mariah_Carey_2_by_David_Shankbone.jpg
