81.5	The_Tempest	The Tempest	The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1610â€“11. It is set on a remote island, where Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan, plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place, using illusion and skilful manipulation. The eponymous tempest brings to the island Prospero's usurping brother Antonio and the complicit Alonso, King of Naples. There, his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's low nature, the redemption of Alonso, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son, Ferdinand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/George_Romney_-_William_Shakespeare_-_The_Tempest_Act_I%2C_Scene_1.jpg/350px-George_Romney_-_William_Shakespeare_-_The_Tempest_Act_I%2C_Scene_1.jpg
