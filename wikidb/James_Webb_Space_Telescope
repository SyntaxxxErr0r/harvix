55.1	James_Webb_Space_Telescope	James Webb Space Telescope	The James Webb Space Telescope , previously known as Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), is a planned space telescope optimized for observations in the infrared, a formal successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The main technical features are a large and very cold 6.5 meter diameter mirror, an observing position far from Earth, orbiting the Earth–Sun L2 point, and four specialized instruments. The combination of these features will give JWST unprecedented resolution and sensitivity from long-wavelength visible to the mid-infrared, enabling its two main scientific goals — studying the birth and evolution of galaxies, and the formation of stars and planets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/James_Webb_Telescope_Design.jpg/250px-James_Webb_Telescope_Design.jpg
