73.8	Orca	Killer whale	The killer whale , commonly referred to as the orca whale or orca, and less commonly as the blackfish, is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family. Killer whales are found in all oceans, from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas. Killer whales as a species have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as sea lions, seals, walruses and even large whales. Killer whales are regarded as apex predators, lacking natural predators.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Killerwhales_jumping.jpg/220px-Killerwhales_jumping.jpg
