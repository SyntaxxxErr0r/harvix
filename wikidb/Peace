95.8	Peace	Peace	Peace is a state of harmony characterized by the lack of violent conflict. Commonly understood as the absence of hostility, peace also suggests the existence of healthy or newly healed interpersonal or international relationships, prosperity in matters of social or economic welfare, the establishment of equality, and a working political order that serves the true interests of all. In international relations, peacetime is not only the absence of war or conflict, but also the presence of cultural and economic understanding .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Fountain_of_Time_full_front.jpg/280px-Fountain_of_Time_full_front.jpg
