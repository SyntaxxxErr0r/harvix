57.0	Mehmed_II	Mehmed II	Mehmed II (March 30, 1432 – May 3, 1481) was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire (Rûm until the conquest) for a short time from 1444 to September 1446, and later from February 1451 to 1481. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople and brought an end to the Byzantine Empire, absorbing its administrative apparatus into the Ottoman state. Mehmed continued his conquests in Asia, with the Anatolian reunification, and in Europe, as far as Belgrade. Mehmed II is regarded as a national hero in Turkey, and his name has been given to Istanbul's Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Sarayi_Album_10a.jpg/220px-Sarayi_Album_10a.jpg
