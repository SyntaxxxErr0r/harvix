146.7	Philip_Glass	Philip Glass	Philip Glass (born January 31, 1937) is an American composer. One of the highest profile composers writing "classical" music today, he is often said to be one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century. His music is also often controversially described as minimalist, along with the work of the other "major minimalists" La Monte Young, Terry Riley and Steve Reich.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Philip_Glass_018.jpg/220px-Philip_Glass_018.jpg
