1.00	Life_in_a_Jar	Life in a Jar	Life in a Jar is a project that began in the fall of 1999. Four rural Kansas students discovered the story of a Polish Catholic woman who saved Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust. While researching for a National History Day project, the students read about Irena Sendlerâ€™s story in a 1994 issue of U.S. News &amp; World Report.
