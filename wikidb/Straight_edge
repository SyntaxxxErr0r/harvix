114.2	Straight_edge	Straight edge	Straight edge is a subculture and subgenre of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco, and other recreational drugs. It was a direct reaction to the sexual revolution, hedonism, and excess associated with punk rock. For some, this extends to not engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term was coined by the 1980s hardcore punk band Minor Threat in their song "Straight Edge".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Straight_Edge_Tattoo_cropped.JPG/220px-Straight_Edge_Tattoo_cropped.JPG
