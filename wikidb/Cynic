57.1	Cynic	Cynicism	Cynicism (Greek: ), in its original form, refers to the beliefs of an ancient school of Greek philosophers known as the Cynics (Greek: , Latin: ). Their philosophy was that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature. This meant rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, health, and fame, and by living a simple life free from all possessions. As reasoning creatures, people could gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for humans. They believed that the world belonged equally to everyone, and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society. Many of these thoughts were later absorbed into Stoicism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Cinico_Capitolini.jpg/200px-Cinico_Capitolini.jpg
