4.10	Mizo_National_Front	Mizo National Front	Mizo National Front (MNF) is a regional political party in Mizoram, India. MNF emerged out of the Mizo National Famine Front, which was formed by Pu Laldenga to protest against the inaction of the Indian central government towards the famine situation in the Mizo areas of the Assam state in 1959. It staged a major uprising in 1966, followed by years of underground activities. In 1986, it signed the Mizo Accord with the Government of India, renouncing secession and violence. MNF suffered a strong incumbency wave in the 2008 Mizoram Election and lost all their MLA seats except three.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d0/Mizo_National_Front_logo.jpg
