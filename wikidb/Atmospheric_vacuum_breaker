3.41	Atmospheric_vacuum_breaker	Atmospheric vacuum breaker	An Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker is a backflow prevention device used in plumbing to prevent backflow of non-potable liquids into the drinking water system. It is usually constructed of brass and resembles a 90-degree elbow with a hood on its top to allow air to enter the water system if a siphon attempts to form. Inside this elbow is a poppet valve that is held "up" by the water pressure found in the system, closing the air entrance to the device. If the pressure in the "upstream side" is reduced to atmospheric pressure or below, the poppet valve drops and allows air to enter the system, breaking the siphon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/AVB-1.JPG/250px-AVB-1.JPG
