81.8	Forbidden_Planet	Forbidden Planet	Forbidden Planet is a 1956 science fiction film directed by Fred M. Wilcox, with a screenplay by Cyril Hume. It stars Leslie Nielsen, Walter Pidgeon, and Anne Francis. The characters and its setting have been compared to those in William Shakespeare's The Tempest, and its plot contains certain story analogs. Forbidden Planet was the first science fiction film that was set entirely on another planet in deep space, away from the planet Earth. It is considered one of the great science fiction films of the 1950s, a precursor of what was to come for the science fiction film genre in the decades that followed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Forbiddenplanetposter.jpg/220px-Forbiddenplanetposter.jpg
