98.6	Kaaba	Kaaba	The Kaaba (or Qaaba; Arabic: â€Ž IPA: ; English: ) is a cuboid-shaped building in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and is the most sacred site in Islam. The Qur'an states that the Kaaba was constructed by Abraham (Ibrahim in Arabic), and his son Ishmael (Ismaeel in Arabic), after the latter had settled in Arabia. The building has a mosque built around it, the Masjid al-Haram. All Muslims around the world face the Kaaba during prayers, no matter where they are. This is called facing the Qiblah.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Kabaa.jpg/265px-Kabaa.jpg
