After Trudeau's death in 1915, the institution's name was changed to the Trudeau Sanatorium, following changes in conventional usage. It was listed under the latter name on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Administration_Bldg%2C_Adirondack_Cottage_Sanitarium.jpg/250px-Administration_Bldg%2C_Adirondack_Cottage_Sanitarium.jpg
