63.3	Krzysztof_Penderecki	Krzysztof Penderecki	Krzysztof Penderecki is a Polish composer and conductor. His 1960 avant-garde Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima for string orchestra brought him to international attention, and this success was followed by acclaim for his choral St. Luke Passion. Both these works exhibit novel compositional techniques. Since the 1970s Penderecki's style has changed to encompass a post-Romantic idiom.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Krzysztof_Penderecki_20080706.jpg/240px-Krzysztof_Penderecki_20080706.jpg
