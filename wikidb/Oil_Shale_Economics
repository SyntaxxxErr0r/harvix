3.01	Oil_Shale_Economics	Oil shale economics	The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale-oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes. According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation, the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, retorting plant, upgrading plant, supporting utilities, and spent shale reclamation), would range between US$70–95 ($440–600/m3, adjusted to 2005 values). This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency. In order for the operation to be profitable, the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels. The analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the complex was established. The hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35–70% after its first 500 million barrels (79^6 m3) were produced. Assuming an increase in output of 25 thousand barrels per day (4.0^3 m3/d) during each year after the start of commercial production, the costs would then be expected to decline to $35–48 per barrel ($220–300/m3) within 12 years. After achieving the milestone of 1 billion barrels (160^6 m3), its costs would decline further to $30–40 per barrel ($190–250/m3). A comparison of the proposed American oil shale industry to the Alberta oil-sands industry has been drawn (the latter enterprise generated over 1 million barrels per day (160^3 m3/d) of oil in late 2007), stating that "the first-generation facility is the hardest, both technically and economically".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Inflacrude.gif/300px-Inflacrude.gif
