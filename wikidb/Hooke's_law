51.3	Hooke's_law	Hooke's law	In mechanics and physics, Hooke's law of elasticity is an approximation that states that the extension of a spring is in direct proportion with the load applied to it. Many materials obey this law as long as the load does not exceed the material's elastic limit. Materials for which Hooke's law is a useful approximation are known as linear-elastic or "Hookean" materials. Hooke's law in simple terms says that strain is directly proportional to stress.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Ressort_de_compression.jpg/250px-Ressort_de_compression.jpg
