84.4	Huguenot	Huguenot	The Huguenots (French: , ; English: , ) were members of the Protestant Reformed Church of France during the 16th and 17th centuries. French Protestants were inspired by the writings of John Calvin in the 1530s, and they were called Huguenots by the 1560s. By the end of the 17th century, roughly 200,000 Huguenots had been driven from France during a series of religious persecutions. They relocated primarily to Protestant nations including England, Wales, Denmark, Switzerland, the Dutch Republic, the Electorate of Brandenburg, Electoral Palatinate (both Holy Roman Empire), and the Duchy of Prussia, and also to South Africa and North America.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Calvin.png/130px-Calvin.png
