78.0	Anne_Boleyn	Anne Boleyn	Anne Boleyn ( , or ); c.1501/1507 â€“ 19 May 1536) was Queen of England from 1533 to 1536 as the second wife of Henry VIII of England and Marquess of Pembroke in her own right. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the English Reformation. Anne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard, and was educated in the Netherlands and France, largely as a maid of honour to Claude of France. She returned to England in early 1522, in order to marry her Irish cousin James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond; however, the marriage plans ended in failure and she secured a post at court as maid of honour to Henry VIII's queen consort, Catherine of Aragon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Anne_Boleyn_Signature.svg/125px-Anne_Boleyn_Signature.svg.png
