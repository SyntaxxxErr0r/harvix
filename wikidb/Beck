98.7	Beck	Beck	Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell, July 8, 1970) is an American musician, singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, known by the stage name Beck. With a pop art collage of musical styles, oblique and ironic lyrics, and postmodern arrangements incorporating samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics throughout his musical career as being amongst the most creative and idiosyncratic musicians of 1990s and 2000s alternative rock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Detour_2006_-_Beck.jpg/220px-Detour_2006_-_Beck.jpg
