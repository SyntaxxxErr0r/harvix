95.2	Henry_Purcell	Henry Purcell	Henry Purcell (10 September 1659 (?)â€“ 21 November 1695), was an English organist and Baroque composer of secular and sacred music. Although Purcell incorporated Italian and French stylistic elements into his compositions, his legacy was a uniquely English form of Baroque music. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Henry_Purcell_by_John_Closterman.jpg/250px-Henry_Purcell_by_John_Closterman.jpg
