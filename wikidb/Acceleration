98.1	Acceleration	Acceleration	In physics, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time. In one dimension, acceleration is the rate at which something speeds up or slows down. However, since velocity is a vector, acceleration describes the rate of change of both the magnitude and the direction of velocity. Acceleration has the dimensions L T âˆ’2. In SI units, acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s2). (Negative acceleration i.e. retardation, also has the same dimensions/units.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Acceleration.JPG/250px-Acceleration.JPG
