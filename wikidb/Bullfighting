78.0	Bullfighting	Bullfighting	Bullfighting, also known as tauromachia ) or tauromachy; from Greek: "bull-fight"; Spanish: ; Portuguese: , is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France and some Latin American countries (Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru), in which one or more bulls are baited, and then slaughtered in a bullring for sport and entertainment. As such is often called a blood sport by its detractors, but followers of the spectacle regard it as a 'fine art' and not a sport as there are no elements of competition in the proceedings. In Portugal, it is illegal to kill a bull in the arena, so it is removed and slaughtered in the pens as fighting bulls can only be used once. A non-lethal variant stemming from Portuguese influence is also practised on the Tanzanian island of Pemba.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Edouard_Manet_063.jpg/300px-Edouard_Manet_063.jpg
