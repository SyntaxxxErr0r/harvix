133.3	Absolute_zero	Absolute zero	Absolute zero is the theoretical temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. The laws of thermodynamics state that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means. A system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state. The kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed. However, in the classical interpretation it is zero and the thermal energy of matter vanishes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Robert_Boyle_0001.jpg/220px-Robert_Boyle_0001.jpg
