10.23	Hydrostatics	Fluid statics	Fluid statics (also called hydrostatics) is the science of fluids at rest, and is a sub-field within fluid mechanics. The term usually refers to the mathematical treatment of the subject. It embraces the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium. The use of fluid to do work is called hydraulics, and the science of fluids in motion is fluid dynamics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg/220px-BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg.png
