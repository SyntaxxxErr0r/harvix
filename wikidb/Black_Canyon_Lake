1.10	Black_Canyon_Lake	Black Canyon Lake	Black Canyon Lake is a lake the Arizona Game and Fish Department built in the 1960s along the Mogollon Rim to provide water recreation opportunities for the public. Despite being affected by the 2002 Rodeo-Chediski Fire, Black Canyon Lake remains a popular and beautiful spot for picnics, camping and fishing. Because of the fire, the entire area around Black Canyon Lake is open for day use only due to the danger of falling trees. The facilities are maintained by Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest division of the USDA Forest Service.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/BlackCanyonLake01.jpg/240px-BlackCanyonLake01.jpg
