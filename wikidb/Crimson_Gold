The film was never distributed in Iranian theatres, because it was considered too "dark". Therefore, it was not possible that Crimson Gold be considered as the Iranian entry for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2003 Oscars as it was not released in Iran.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f5/Crimsongold.jpg/220px-Crimsongold.jpg
