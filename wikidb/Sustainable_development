208.2	Sustainable_development	Sustainable development	Sustainable development is a pattern of growth in which resource use aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for generations to come (sometimes taught as ELF-Environment, Local people, Future ). The term sustainable development was used by the Brundtland Commission which coined what has become the most often-quoted definition of sustainable development as development that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/PS20andPS10.jpg/300px-PS20andPS10.jpg
