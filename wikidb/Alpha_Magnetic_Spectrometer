52.4	Alpha_Magnetic_Spectrometer	Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer	The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, also designated AMS-02, is a particle physics experiment module that is mounted on the International Space Station. It is designed to search for various types of unusual matter by measuring cosmic rays. Its experiments will help researchers study the formation of the Universe and search for evidence of dark matter as well as investigate antimatter. The principal investigator is Nobel laureate particle physicist Samuel Ting. After final testing at ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) facility in the Netherlands, delivery to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida took place on 26 August 2010. The launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour flight STS-134 carrying AMS-02 took place on 16 May 2011, and the spectrometer was installed on 19 May 2011.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/AMS-02_Logo.png/230px-AMS-02_Logo.png
