82.5	Business_Plot	Business Plot	The Business Plot (also known as the Plot Against FDR, the White House Putsch) was an alleged political conspiracy in 1933. Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler claimed that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans' organization and use it in a coup d'Ã©tat to overthrow United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler as leader of that organization. In 1934, Butler testified to the Special Committee on Un-American Activities Congressional committee (the "McCormack-Dickstein Committee") on these claims. In the opinion of the committee, these allegations were credible. No one was prosecuted.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Evictbonusarmy.jpg/260px-Evictbonusarmy.jpg
