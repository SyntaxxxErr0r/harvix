19.02	Liquid_funk	Liquid funk	Liquid funk (alternatively, Liquid Drum &amp; Bass, Liquid DNB or Liquid) is a sub-genre of drum and bass. While it uses similar basslines and bar layouts to other styles, it contains fewer bar-oriented samples and more instrumental layers (both synthesized and natural), harmonies, and ambience, producing a calmer atmosphere directed at both home listeners and nightclub audiences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Calibre_Marcus1.jpg/250px-Calibre_Marcus1.jpg
