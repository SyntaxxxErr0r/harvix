133.2	Literature	Literature	Literature (from Latin litterae (plural); letter) is the art of written work, and is not confined to published sources (although, under some circumstances, unpublished sources can also be exempt). The word literature literally means "acquaintance with letters" and the pars pro toto term "letters" is sometimes used to signify "literature," as in the figures of speech "arts and letters" and "man of letters." The four major classifications of literature are poetry, prose, fiction, and non-fiction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Old_book_bindings.jpg/240px-Old_book_bindings.jpg
