51.4	Nim_Chimpsky	Nim Chimpsky	Nim Chimpsky (November 19, 1973 â€“ March 10, 2000) was a chimpanzee who was the subject of an extended study of animal language acquisition (codenamed 6.001) at Columbia University, led by Herbert S. Terrace. Chimpsky was given his name as a pun on Noam Chomsky, the foremost theorist of human language structure and generative grammar at the time, who held that humans were "wired" to develop language.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f5/Nim_Chimpsky.jpg/220px-Nim_Chimpsky.jpg
