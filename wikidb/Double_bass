61.5	Double_bass	Double bass	The double bass, also called the string bass, upright bass, bass fiddle, bass violin, doghouse bass, contrabass, or stand-up bass, is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra, with strings usually tuned to E1, A1, D2 and G2 (see standard tuning). The double bass is a standard member of the string section of the symphony orchestra and smaller string ensembles in Western classical music. In addition, it is used in other genres such as jazz, 1950s-style blues and rock and roll, rockabilly/psychobilly, traditional country music, bluegrass, tango and many types of folk music. A person who plays the double bass is usually referred to as a bassist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/AGK_bass1_full.jpg/177px-AGK_bass1_full.jpg
