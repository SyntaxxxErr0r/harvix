99.6	M-theory	M-theory	In theoretical physics, M-theory is an extension of string theory in which 11 dimensions are identified. Because the dimensionality exceeds that of superstring theories in 10 dimensions, proponents believe that the 11-dimensional theory unites all five string theories (and supersedes them). Though a full description of the theory is not known, the low-entropy dynamics are known to be supergravity interacting with 2- and 5-dimensional membranes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Calabi-Yau-alternate.png/220px-Calabi-Yau-alternate.png
