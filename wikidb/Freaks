58.5	Freaks	Freaks	Freaks is a 1932 American Pre-Code horror film about sideshow performers, directed and produced by Tod Browning and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, with a cast mostly composed of actual carnival performers. The film was based on Tod Robbins' 1923 short story "Spurs". Director Browning took the exceptional step of casting real people with deformities as the eponymous sideshow "freaks," rather than using costumes and makeup.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/FreaksPoster.jpg/220px-FreaksPoster.jpg
