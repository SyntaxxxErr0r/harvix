61.0	HSV_color_space	HSL and HSV	HSL and HSV are the two most common cylindrical-coordinate representations of points in an RGB color model, which rearrange the geometry of RGB in an attempt to be more intuitive and perceptually relevant than the cartesian (cube) representation. They were developed in the 1970s for computer graphics applications, and are used for color pickers, in color-modification tools in image editing software, and less commonly for image analysis and computer vision.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Hsl-hsv_models.svg/400px-Hsl-hsv_models.svg.png
