1.00	Praise_and_Blame	Praise &amp; Blame	Praise &amp; Blame is the 39th studio album by Welsh musician Tom Jones, released 26 July 2010. The album was Jonesâ€™ first release with Island Records and was recorded in 2009 at the Real World Studios in England. Produced by Ethan Johns, Praise &amp; Blame was made up of largely little known devotional and gospel covers, marking a departure from the pop-orientated style that had dominated Jones' recent recordings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Praise_and_blame_album_cover.jpg/220px-Praise_and_blame_album_cover.jpg
