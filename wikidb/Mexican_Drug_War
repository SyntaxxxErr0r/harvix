71.5	Mexican_Drug_War	Mexican Drug War	The Mexican Drug War is an ongoing armed conflict taking place among rival drug cartels fighting each other for regional control, and Mexican government forces seeking to combat drug trafficking. However, the government's principal goal has been to put down the drug-related violence that was raging between different rival drug cartels in Mexico before any military intervention was made. In addition, the Mexican government has claimed that their primary focus is on dismantling the powerful drug cartels, rather than on drug trafficking prevention, which is left to U.S. functionaries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Mexican_Army.jpg/220px-Mexican_Army.jpg
