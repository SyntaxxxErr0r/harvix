84.7	Trilobite	Trilobite	Trilobites ( , ; meaning "three lobes") are a well-known fossil group of extinct marine arthropods that form the class Trilobita. The first appearance of trilobites in the fossil record defines the base of the Atdabanian stage of the Early Cambrian period (), and they flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era before beginning a drawn-out decline to extinction when, during the Devonian, almost all trilobite orders, with the sole exception of Proetida, died out. Trilobites finally disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian about . The trilobites were among the most successful of all early animals, roaming the oceans for over 270 million years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Kainops_invius_lateral_and_ventral.JPG/220px-Kainops_invius_lateral_and_ventral.JPG
