6.20	R_Coronae_Borealis	R Coronae Borealis	R Coronae Borealis is a yellow supergiant star, and is the prototype of the RCB class of variable stars, which fade by several magnitudes at irregular intervals. R Coronae Borealis itself normally shines at approximately magnitude 6, just about visible to the naked eye, in the constellation of Corona Borealis, but at intervals of several months to many years fades to as faint as magnitude 14. Over successive months it gradually returns to its normal brightness, giving it the nickname "Fade-Out star," or "Reverse Nova".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/R_CrB.png/220px-R_CrB.png
