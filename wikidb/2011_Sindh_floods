The floods have caused considerable damage; an estimated 434 civilians have been killed, with 5.3 millio­n people and 1,524,773 homes affect­ed. Sindh is a fertile region and often called the "breadbasket" of the country; the damage and toll of the floods on the local agrarian economy is said to be extensive. At least 1.7 million acres of arable land have been inundated as a result of the flooding. The flooding follows the previous year's historic 2010 Pakistan floods, which devastated the entire country. Unprecedented torrential monsoon rains caused severe flooding in 16 districts of Sindh province.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/PakistanSindh.png
