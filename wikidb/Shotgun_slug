10.40	Shotgun_slug	Shotgun slug	The Brenneke slug was developed by the German gun and ammunition designer Wilhelm Brenneke (1865â€“1951) in 1898. The original Brenneke slug is a solid lead slug with fins cast onto the outside, much like a rifled Foster slug. There is a plastic, felt or cellulose fiber wad attached to the base that remains attached after firing. This wad serves both as a gas seal and as a form of drag stabilization, much like the mass-forward design of the Foster slug. The "fins" impart little or no spin to the projectile; the actual purpose of the "fins" is to decrease the bearing surface of the slug to the barrel and therefore reduce friction and increase velocity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Brenneke.jpg/250px-Brenneke.jpg
