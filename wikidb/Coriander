146.7	Coriander	Coriander	Coriander , also called cilantro or dhania, is an annual herb in the family Apiaceae. Coriander is native to southern Europe and North Africa to southwestern Asia. It is a soft, hairless plant growing to 50 centimetres (20 in) tall. The leaves are variable in shape, broadly lobed at the base of the plant, and slender and feathery higher on the flowering stems. The flowers are borne in small umbels, white or very pale pink, asymmetrical, with the petals pointing away from the center of the umbel longer (5–6 mm) than those pointing towards it (only 1–3 mm long). The fruit is a globular, dry schizocarp 3–5 mm diameter. While in the English-speaking world (except for the U.S.) the leaves and seeds are known as coriander, in American culinary usage the leaves are generally referred to by the Spanish word cilantro.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Coriandrum_sativum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-193.jpg/220px-Coriandrum_sativum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-193.jpg
