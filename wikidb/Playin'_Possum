2.00	Playin'_Possum	Playin' Possum	Playin' Possum is the 1982 debut solo album by Maureen Tucker of The Velvet Underground. The album features a number of renditions of classic rock and roll songs, (such as the 1955 standard "Louie Louie", Bo Diddley's title song from his 1958 self-titled album and the Little Richard hit "Slippin' and Slidin'"), as well as renditions of more modern rock songs (including Bob Dylan's "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight" and The Velvet Underground's own "Heroin"). Tucker performs every instrument on the album and recorded it in her living room, dubbed "Trash Records".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Playin%27_possum.JPG
