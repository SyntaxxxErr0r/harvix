In 1931 Ernst Stromer named Carcharodontosauridae as a family, in modern paleontology this name indicates a clade within Carnosauria. Carcharodontosaurids included some of the largest land predators ever known: Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Tyrannotitan all rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus in size.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Carcharodontosaurus.jpg/250px-Carcharodontosaurus.jpg
