2.00	Mayors_of_Atlanta	List of mayors of Atlanta	This is a list of mayors of Atlanta in the state of Georgia in the United States. The term of office was one year until Hammock's second term, when a new city charter changed it to two years. The term was changed to four years in 1929, giving Ragsdale the modern stay in office. Though a political party is listed where known, the mayoral election is officially non-partisan, so the candidate did not represent their party when elected. In recent history, the viable candidates in the race have been primarily Democrats.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Seal_of_Georgia.svg/150px-Seal_of_Georgia.svg.png
