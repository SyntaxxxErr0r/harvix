1.00	Lakarian_City	Star Trek: Deep Space Nine	Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (sometimes abbreviated to ST: DS9 or DS9) is a science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe. Set in the 24th century from the year 2369 through 2375, it took place on a space station instead of a starship, so as not to have two series with starships at the same time (the starship USS Defiant was introduced in season 3, but the station remained the primary setting for the show). This made continuing story arcs and the appearance of recurring characters much more feasible. The show is noted for its well-developed characters and its original, complex plots. The series depended on darker themes, less physical exploration of space, and (in later seasons) an emphasis on many aspects of war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/DS9logo.JPG
