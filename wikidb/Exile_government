3.00	Exile_government	Government in exile	A government in exile is a political group that claims to be a country's legitimate government, but for various reasons is unable to exercise its legal power, and instead resides in a foreign country. Governments in exile usually operate under the assumption that they will one day return to their native country and regain power. They are distinguished from rump states in the sense that a rump state still controls at least part of its previous territory (for example, during the First World War nearly all of Belgium was German-occupied, but Belgium and its allies held on to a small slice in the country's west); a government in exile, conversely, has lost all its territory.
