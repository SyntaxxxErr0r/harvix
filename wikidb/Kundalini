81.1	Kundalini	Kundalini	Kundalini (, Sanskrit: , Tamil : வாலை, Thai: กุณฺฑลินี) literally means coiled. In yoga, a "corporeal energy" - an unconscious, instinctive or libidinal force or Shakti, lies coiled at the base of the spine. It is envisioned either as a goddess or else as a sleeping serpent, hence a number of English renderings of the term such as 'serpent power'. The kundalini resides in the sacrum bone in three and a half coils and has been described as a residual power of pure desire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/DiagrammaChakraKundalini.jpg/220px-DiagrammaChakraKundalini.jpg
