2.00	John_de_Vere%2C_7th_Earl_of_Oxford	John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford	John de Vere was the only son of Alfonso de Vere, and Jane, daughter of Sir Richard Foliot. Alfonso was a younger son of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford, and brother of Robert de Vere, 6th Earl of Oxford. When the younger Earl Robert's son died without issue in 1329, the earl obtained licence from the king to entail his estates on his nephew, John. It was in this way that John de Vere, when his uncle died 17 April 1331, became Earl of Oxford. He had made homage and received livery by 17 May.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Snowykeepsm.jpg/220px-Snowykeepsm.jpg
