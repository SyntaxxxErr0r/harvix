Although it is adapted from the original Brazilian show named Est√∫dio Coca-Cola, it is fundamentally different from the original version where the show was a concert style show whereas the Pakistani version records its shows inside a closed studio. The program focuses on a fusion of the diverse musical influences in Pakistan, including eastern classical, folk, and contemporary popular music. The show provides a platform for renowned as well as upcoming and less mainstream artists, from various genres and regions, to collaborate musically in live studio recording sessions. It is one of the most popular music programmes in Asia and is a brand product of Coca-Cola.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/CokeStudioLogo_BkSm.png/250px-CokeStudioLogo_BkSm.png
