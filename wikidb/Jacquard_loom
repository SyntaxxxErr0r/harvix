61.0	Jacquard_loom	Jacquard loom	The Jacquard loom is a mechanical loom, invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1801, that simplifies the process of manufacturing textiles with complex patterns such as brocade, damask and matelasse. The loom is controlled by punched cards with punched holes, each row of which corresponds to one row of the design. Multiple rows of holes are punched on each card and the many cards that compose the design of the textile are strung together in order. It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728) and Jacques Vaucanson (1740)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Jacquard_Loom_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2326269.jpg/220px-Jacquard_Loom_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2326269.jpg
