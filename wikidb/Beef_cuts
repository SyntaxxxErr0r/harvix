2.10	Beef_cuts	Beef	Beef is the culinary name for meat from bovines, especially domestic cattle. Beef can be harvested from cows, bulls, heifers or steers. It is one of the principal meats used in the cuisine of the Middle East (including Pakistan and Afghanistan), Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Europe and the United States, and is also important in Africa, parts of East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Beef is considered a taboo food in some cultures, especially in Indian culture, and thence is eschewed by Hindus and Jains; However, Hinduism's scriptures indicate a recorded history of beef consumption, with the taboo arising at a later period due to the ascendancy of the cow in terms of importance to the farming communities of the time. it is also discouraged among some Buddhists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Standing-rib-roast.jpg/250px-Standing-rib-roast.jpg
