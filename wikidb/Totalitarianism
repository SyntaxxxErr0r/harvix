100.6	Totalitarianism	Totalitarianism	Totalitarianism (or totalitarian rule) is a political system where the state recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to regulate every aspect of public and private life wherever feasible. Totalitarian regimes stay in political power through an all-encompassing propaganda campaign, which is disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that is often marked by political repression, personality cultism, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of speech, mass surveillance, and widespread use of terror.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Stalin_Hitler.png/220px-Stalin_Hitler.png
