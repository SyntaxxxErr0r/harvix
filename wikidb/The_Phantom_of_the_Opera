63.7	The_Phantom_of_the_Opera	The Phantom of the Opera	Le Fantôme de l'Opéra (English: The Phantom of the Opera) is a novel by French writer Gaston Leroux. It was first published as a serialisation in "Le Gaulois" from September 23, 1909 to January 8, 1910. Initially, the story sold very poorly upon publication in book form and was even out of print several times during the twentieth century; it is overshadowed by the success of its various film and stage adaptations. The most notable of these were the 1925 film depiction, Ken Hill's 1976 musical at the Theatre Royal Stratford East followed ten years later by Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical, and Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher's 2004 film.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Phantom_of_the_Opera_Cover.jpg/200px-Phantom_of_the_Opera_Cover.jpg
