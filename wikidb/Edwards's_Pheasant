It is named after the French ornithologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards and first described to science in 1896 The bird's length is 58–65 centimetres (23–26 in) and has red legs and facial skin. The male is mainly blue-black with a crest, and the female is a drab brown bird. Edwards′s Pheasant is very identical to the similarly-sized Vietnamese Pheasant, which it overlaps with throughout its range. The male bird however lacks the white tail feathers of that species. The alarm call is a puk!-puk!-puk!.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Male_edwards%27_pheasant.JPG/220px-Male_edwards%27_pheasant.JPG
