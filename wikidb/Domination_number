2.20	Domination_number	Dominating set	In graph theory, a dominating set for a graph G = is a subset D of V such that every vertex not in D is joined to at least one member of D by some edge. The domination number Î³(G) is the number of vertices in a smallest dominating set for G.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Dominating-set.svg/150px-Dominating-set.svg.png
