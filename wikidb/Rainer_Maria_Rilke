157.9	Rainer_Maria_Rilke	Rainer Maria Rilke	René Karl Wilhelm Johann Josef Maria Rilke (German pronunciation: ; 4 December 1875 – 29 December 1926), better known as Rainer Maria Rilke, was a Bohemian–Austrian poet. He is considered one of the most significant poets in the German language. His haunting images focus on the difficulty of communion with the ineffable in an age of disbelief, solitude, and profound anxiety: themes that tend to position him as a transitional figure between the traditional and the modernist poets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Rainer_Maria_Rilke%2C_1900.jpg/220px-Rainer_Maria_Rilke%2C_1900.jpg
