2.10	Honda_FC50	Honda FC50	The Honda FC50, also known as the "Beat", was a 50 cc scooter manufactured by Honda in 1983. It was produced mainly for the Japanese domestic market—although both new and used models were exported from Japan—making it a fairly hard-to-find scooter. It was available in red or black only, both with gold wheels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Honda_FC50_1.jpg/120px-Honda_FC50_1.jpg
