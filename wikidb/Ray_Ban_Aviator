1.00	Ray_Ban_Aviator	Ray-Ban Aviator	Aviator sunglasses are a style of sunglasses that were developed by Bausch &amp; Lomb and branded as Ray-Ban. They are characterised by dark, often reflective lenses having an area two or three times the area of the eyeball, and very thin metal frames with double or triple bridge and bayonet earpieces or flexible cable temples that hook behind the ears. The original design featured G-15 tempered glass lenses, i.e., neutral gray, transmitting 20% of incoming light. The large lenses are not flat but slightly convex. The design attempts to cover the entire range of the human eye and prevent as much light as possible from entering the eye from any angle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/RayBanAviator.jpg/220px-RayBanAviator.jpg
