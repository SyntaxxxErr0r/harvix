It is a department of the University of Oxford and is governed by a group of 15 academics appointed by the Vice-Chancellor known as the Delegates of the Press. They are headed by the Secretary to the Delegates, who serves as OUP's chief executive and as its major representative on other university bodies. Oxford University has used a similar system to oversee the Press since the 17th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/OUP_logo.svg/255px-OUP_logo.svg.png
