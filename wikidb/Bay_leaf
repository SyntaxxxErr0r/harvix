Fresh or dried bay leaves are used in cooking for their distinctive flavor and fragrance. The leaves are often used to flavor soups, stews, braises and pâtés in Mediterranean cuisine. The fresh leaves are very mild and do not develop their full flavor until several weeks after picking and drying.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Illustration_Laurus_nobilis0.jpg/220px-Illustration_Laurus_nobilis0.jpg
