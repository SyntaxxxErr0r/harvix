90.4	Georges_Seurat	Georges Seurat	Georges Pierre Seurat (French pronunciation: ; 2 December 1859 – 29 March 1891) was a French Post-Impressionist painter and draftsman. He is noted for his innovative use of drawing media and for devising a technique of painting known as pointillism. His large-scale work A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (1884–1886), Seurat's most famous painting, altered the direction of modern art by initiating Neo-impressionism, and is one of the icons of 19th century painting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Georges_Seurat_1888.jpg/150px-Georges_Seurat_1888.jpg
