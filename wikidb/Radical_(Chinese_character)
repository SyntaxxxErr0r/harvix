35.07	Radical_(Chinese_character)	Radical (Chinese character)	A Chinese radical (from the Latin radix, meaning "root") is a component of a Chinese character. The term may variously refer to the original semantic (meaning-bearing) element of a character, or to any semantic element, or, loosely, to any element whatever its origin or purpose. The term is commonly used to describe the element under which a character is traditionally listed in a Chinese dictionary, which is often semantic but may sometimes be a phonetic or merely artificially extracted portion of the character. When used in this way as dictionary section headers , radicals form the basis of an indexing system that has classified Chinese characters throughout the ages, from ancient Shuōwén Jiézì characters to their modern successors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Chinese_character_%E6%8E%A1_cai3_pick_with_ROOT_colored.svg/260px-Chinese_character_%E6%8E%A1_cai3_pick_with_ROOT_colored.svg.png
