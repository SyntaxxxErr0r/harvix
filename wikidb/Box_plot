57.7	Box_plot	Box plot	In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot (also known as a box-and-whisker diagram or plot) is a convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their five-number summaries: the smallest observation , lower quartile (Q1), median (Q2), upper quartile (Q3), and largest observation (sample maximum). A boxplot may also indicate which observations, if any, might be considered outliers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Michelsonmorley-boxplot.svg/300px-Michelsonmorley-boxplot.svg.png
