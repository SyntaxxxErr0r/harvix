107.5	Edsel	Edsel	The Edsel was an automobile manufactured by the Ford Motor Company during the 1958, 1959, and 1960 model years. The Edsel never gained popularity with contemporary American car buyers and sold poorly. Consequently, the Ford Motor Company lost millions of dollars on the Edsel's development, manufacture, and marketing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/EdsellogoE.png/125px-EdsellogoE.png
