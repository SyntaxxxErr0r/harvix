59.8	Pickling	Pickling	Pickling, also known as brining or corning is the process of preserving food by anaerobic fermentation in brine (a solution of salt in water) to produce lactic acid, or marinating and storing it in an acid solution, usually vinegar . The resulting food is called a pickle. This procedure gives the food a salty or sour taste. In South Asia, edible oils are used as the pickling medium with vinegar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/PicklingCucumbers.jpg/220px-PicklingCucumbers.jpg
