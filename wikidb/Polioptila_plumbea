1.00	Polioptila_plumbea	Tropical Gnatcatcher	The Tropical Gnatcatcher is a small active insectivorous songbird, which is a resident species throughout a large part of the Neotropics. There are large geographical variations in its voice and plumage, resulting in some populations sometimes being considered separate species, notably the bilineata group as the White-browed Gnatcatcher, and the taxon maior as the Marañón Gnatcatcher.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg/220px-Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg.png
