1.00	%E2%90%A0	Space (punctuation)	In writing, a space ( ) is a blank area devoid of content, serving to separate words, letters, numbers, and punctuation. Conventions for interword and intersentence spaces vary among languages, and in some cases the spacing rules are quite complex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Punctuation_Spaces.svg/150px-Punctuation_Spaces.svg.png
