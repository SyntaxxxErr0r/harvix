99.0	Lynching	Lynching	Lynching is an extrajudicial execution carried out by a mob, often by hanging, but also by burning at the stake or shooting, in order to punish an alleged transgressor, or to intimidate, control, or otherwise manipulate a population of people. It is related to other means of social control that arise in communities, such as charivari, riding the rail, and tarring and feathering. Lynchings have been more frequent in times of social and economic tension, and have often been the means used by the politically dominant population to oppress social challengers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Lynching2.jpg/250px-Lynching2.jpg
