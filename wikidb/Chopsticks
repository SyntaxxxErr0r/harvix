51.9	Chopsticks	Chopsticks	Chopsticks are short tapered sticks used in pairs of equal length, which are used as the traditional eating utensils of China, Mongolia, Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Generally believed to have originated in ancient China, they can also be found in some areas of Tibet and Nepal that are close to Han Chinese populations, as well as areas of Thailand, Laos and Burma which have significant Chinese populations; otherwise, the traditional method of eating is with hands, and more recently, Western cutlery. Chopsticks are most commonly made of wood, bamboo or plastic, but are also made of metal, bone, ivory. Chopsticks are held in the dominant hand, between the thumb and fingers, and used to pick up pieces of food.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Chopstick.png/220px-Chopstick.png
