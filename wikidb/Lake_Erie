73.7	Lake_Erie	Lake Erie	Lake Erie (French: ) is the fourth largest lake (by surface area) of the five Great Lakes in North America, and the tenth largest globally. It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time. It is bounded on the north by the Canadian province of Ontario, on the south by the U.S. states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, and on the west by the state of Michigan. The lake is named after the Erie tribe of Native Americans who lived along its southern shore. The outflow from the lake provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U.S. as it spins huge turbines at Niagara Falls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Lake_Erie_looking_southward.jpg/240px-Lake_Erie_looking_southward.jpg
