1.00	I_Sang	Yi Sang	Yi Sang (August 20, 1910 - April 17, 1937) is considered one of the most innovative writers in modern Korean literature. Crossing and blurring the boundaries between poetry, fiction and essay, his experiments in literary form and language, as well the psychological complexity of his inquiry into passion, eroticism and the indeterminate nature of self were unprecedented in Korean literary practices of his time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Leesang.jpg
