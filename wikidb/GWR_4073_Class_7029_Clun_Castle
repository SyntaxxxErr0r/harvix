2.00	GWR_4073_Class_7029_Clun_Castle	GWR 4073 Class 7029 Clun Castle	7029 Clun Castle was built to the Great Western Railway Castle Class design by the Western Region of British Railways at Swindon Works in May 1950 and was named after Clun Castle. Its first shed allocation was Newton Abbot. It had a double chimney and a 4 row superheater fitted in October 1959. Its most famous moment came on 9 May 1964 on the Plymouth to Bristol leg of a special train to mark the record set sixty years earlier by "City of Truro" when it was timed at 96 mph on the descent of Wellington Bank in Somerset. Its last shed allocation was Gloucester in May 1965. It hauled the last official steam train out of Paddington (to Banbury) on 11 June 1965. It was officially withdrawn (and believed to be the last Castle) in December 1965. It was bought by Mr Patrick Whitehouse in 1966 before being passed to 7029 Clun Castle Ltd. In preservation it has always been based at Tyseley shed, now Tyseley Locomotive Works.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/GWR_4073_7029_Clun_Castle_at_Chester_General.jpg/220px-GWR_4073_7029_Clun_Castle_at_Chester_General.jpg
