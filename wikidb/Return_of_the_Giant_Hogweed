1.00	Return_of_the_Giant_Hogweed	Nursery Cryme	Nursery Cryme is the third studio album by Genesis and was recorded and released in 1971. It is also the first album to feature the classic five-piece line-up of Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Phil Collins and Steve Hackett; the latter two replacing John Mayhew and Anthony Phillips, on drums and guitar respectively, in 1970 and 1971. This line-up remained consistent until A Trick of the Tail, when Phil Collins became lead singer instead of Peter Gabriel after his departure from the band in 1975.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/NurseryCryme71.jpg/220px-NurseryCryme71.jpg
