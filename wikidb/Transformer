88.8	Transformer	Transformer	A transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through inductively coupled conductorsâ€”the transformer's coils. A varying current in the first or primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer's core and thus a varying magnetic field through the secondary winding. This varying magnetic field induces a varying electromotive force (EMF), or "voltage", in the secondary winding. This effect is called inductive coupling.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Polemount-singlephase-closeup.jpg/220px-Polemount-singlephase-closeup.jpg
