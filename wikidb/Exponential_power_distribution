3.20	Exponential_power_distribution	Generalized normal distribution	The generalized normal distribution or generalized Gaussian distribution is either of two families of parametric continuous probability distributions on the real line. Both families add a shape parameter to the normal distribution. To distinguish the two families, they are referred to below as "version 1" and "version 2." However this is not a standard nomenclature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Generalized_normal_densities.svg/325px-Generalized_normal_densities.svg.png
