3.00	Vishtaspa	Vishtaspa	Vishtaspa is the Avestan-language name of a figure of Zoroastrian scripture and tradition, portrayed as an early follower of Zoroaster, and his patron, and instrumental in the diffusion of the prophet's message. Although Vishtaspa is not epigraphically attested, he is – like Zoroaster also – generally assumed to have been a historical figure (and would have lived in the 10th century BCE or earlier; theories on a floruit date for Zoroaster vary widely).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Faravahar-Gold.svg/140px-Faravahar-Gold.svg.png
