Usually the temporary crown is constructed from a chemical-cure composite, although alternative systems using aluminium crown forms are occasionally used by practitioners. The temporary material is shaped by the dentist to form a tooth shape that protects the prepared tooth, prevents damage to the periodontal tissues (gums) and disguises the prepared tooth to a degree until the final, definitive restoration can be made by a dental technician.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Temporary_crown_a.jpg/148px-Temporary_crown_a.jpg
