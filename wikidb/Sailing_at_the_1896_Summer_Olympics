It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era. Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organized by Pierre de Coubertin, a French pedagogue and historian, in Paris, on June 23, 1894. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was also instituted during this congress.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Athens_1896_report_cover.jpg/175px-Athens_1896_report_cover.jpg
