1.00	Best_Rock_Video	MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video	The MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video was first given out in 1989, and it was one of the four original genre categories added to the VMAs that year. That year, though, the award was called the Best Heavy Metal Video. From 1990 to 1995, the award was called the Best Metal/Hard Rock Video, and in 1996, the award was once again renamed Best Hard Rock Video. Finally, in 1997 the award acquired its present, more general name of Best Rock Video, as, after 1998, acts which would have previously been eligible for the Best Alternative Video award became eligible for this one. This award was not given out in 2007, as the VMAs were revamped and most original categories were eliminated. In 2008, though, MTV brought back this category, along with several of the others that were retired in 2007. Aerosmith is both the biggest winner and the biggest nominee in this category, having been nominated a record eight times for this award and winning four of these. Linkin Park comes second in victories with three wins; while Metallica is the second most-nominated act, having received a total of six nominations between 1989 and 2003.
