56.0	AMC_Gremlin	AMC Gremlin	The AMC Gremlin is a two-door subcompact car produced in the United States and Canada by the American Motors Corporation (AMC) between 1970 and 1978. In typical fashion, AMC expanded their development and manufacturing profits by adapting a shortened Hornet platform with a Kammback-type tail, continuing the 1968â€“1970 Javelin and AMX pattern but without the limited production aspect of the AMX, as forecast by the 1969 AMX GT. The manufacturer described the car as "the first American-built import".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/aa/1970_Gremlin.jpg/250px-1970_Gremlin.jpg
