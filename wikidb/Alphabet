77.7	Alphabet	Alphabet	An alphabet is a standard set of letters—basic written symbols or graphemes—each of which represents a phoneme in a spoken language, either as it exists now or as it was in the past. There are other systems, such as logographies, in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit, and syllabaries, in which each character represents a syllable. Alphabets are classified according to how they indicate vowels:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Caslon-schriftmusterblatt.jpeg/300px-Caslon-schriftmusterblatt.jpeg
