6.00	Just_like_Heaven_(song)	Just Like Heaven (song)	"Just Like Heaven" is a song by the British alternative rock band The Cure. The group wrote most of the song during recording sessions in southern France in 1987. The lyrics were written by the band's frontman Robert Smith, who drew inspiration from a past trip to the sea shore with his future wife. Before Smith had completed the lyrics, an instrumental version of the song was used as the theme for the French television show Les Enfants du Rock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/Justlikeheaven.jpg/220px-Justlikeheaven.jpg
