102.4	Neoteny	Neoteny	Neoteny ( ), also called juvenilization, is one of the two ways by which paedomorphism can arise. Paedomorphism is the retention by adults of traits previously seen only in juveniles, and is a subject studied in the field of developmental biology. In neoteny, the physiological (or somatic) development of an animal or organism is slowed or delayed. In contrast, in progenesis, sexual development occurs faster. Both processes result in paedomorphism. Ultimately this process results in the retention, in the adults of a species, of juvenile physical characteristics well into maturity and pedogenesis , the reproduction in a neotenized state.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Neoteny_body_proportion_heterochrony_human.png/300px-Neoteny_body_proportion_heterochrony_human.png
