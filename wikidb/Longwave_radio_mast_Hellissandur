This mast, which is the tallest structure in Western Europe, is insulated against ground and guyed in 5 levels by steel ropes, which are subdivided by insulators. It was built in 1963 as replacement for a 190.5 metre (625 ft) tall LORAN-C tower, which was built in 1959, for the North Atlantic LORAN-C chain (GRD 7970). After the LORAN-C scheme was shut down on December 31, 1994 the longwave radio mast Hellissandur was converted to an aerial mast for a longwave broadcasting transmitter of the Broadcasting Service of Iceland, for a transmission frequency of 189 kHz and a power of 300 kilowatts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Hellissandur_3.jpg/220px-Hellissandur_3.jpg
