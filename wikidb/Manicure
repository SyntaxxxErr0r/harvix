51.5	Manicure	Manicure	A manicure is a cosmetic beauty treatment for the fingernails and hands performed at home or in a nail salon. A manicure treatment is not only a treatment for the natural nails but also for the hands. A manicure consists of filing, shaping of the free edge, treatments, massage of the hand and the application of polish. There are also manicure services that are specialties for the hands and feet. For the hands, the soaking of a softening substance and the application of a lotion is a common specialty. When applied to the toenails and feet, this treatment is referred to as a pedicure. The word "manicure" derives from Latin: manus for "hand," cura for "care."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Frenchmanicurewiki.jpg/225px-Frenchmanicurewiki.jpg
