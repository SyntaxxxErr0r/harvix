1.10	Black-knobbed_map_turtle	Black-knobbed map turtle	The black-knobbed map turtle (Graptemys nigrinoda) (formerly known as the black-knobbed sawback turtle) is a small to medium sized aquatic turtle with light gray skin. Some of the most distinguishing characteristics of the black-knobbed map turtle, and the Graptemys genus, are the protruding “spikes” on the turtle’s shell. This species resides mainly in the fall lines of rivers in the Mobile Bay drainage, in Alabama and Mississippi.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Graptemys_nigrinoda_hatchlings.jpg/220px-Graptemys_nigrinoda_hatchlings.jpg
