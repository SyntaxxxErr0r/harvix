73.8	Binomial_coefficient	Binomial coefficient	In mathematics, binomial coefficients are a family of positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem. They are indexed by two nonnegative integers; the binomial coefficient indexed by n and k is usually written , and it is the coefficient of the x k term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power (1 + x) n. Arranging binomial coefficients into rows for successive values of n, and in which k ranges from 0 to n, gives a triangular array called Pascal's triangle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Pascal%27s_triangle_5.svg/200px-Pascal%27s_triangle_5.svg.png
