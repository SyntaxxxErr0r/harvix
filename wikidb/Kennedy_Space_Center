85.1	Kennedy_Space_Center	Kennedy Space Center	The John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is the NASA installation that has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are currently on hiatus, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Its iconic Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the fourth-largest structure in the world by volume and was the largest when completed in 1965.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg/100px-NASA_logo.svg.png
