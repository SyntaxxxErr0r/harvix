63.7	Thermal_radiation	Thermal radiation	Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of charged particles in matter. All matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation. The mechanism is that bodies with a temperature above absolute zero have atoms or molecules with kinetic energies which are changing, and these changes result in charge-acceleration and/or dipole oscillation of the charges that compose the atoms. This motion of charges produces electromagnetic radiation in the usual way. However, the side spectrum of this radiation reflects the wide spectrum of energies and accelerations of the charges in any piece of matter at even a single temperature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Wiens_law.svg/300px-Wiens_law.svg.png
