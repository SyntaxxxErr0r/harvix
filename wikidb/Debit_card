73.2	Debit_card	Debit card	A debit card (also known as a bank card or check card) is a plastic card that provides the cardholder electronic access to his or her bank account(s) at a financial institution. Some cards have a stored value with which a payment is made, while most relay a message to the cardholder's bank to withdraw funds from a designated account in favor of the payee's designated bank account. The card can be used as an alternative payment method to cash when making purchases. In some cases, the primary account number is assigned exclusively for use on the Internet and there is no physical card.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Smartcard2.png/140px-Smartcard2.png
