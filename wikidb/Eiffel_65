24.23	Eiffel_65	Eiffel 65	Eiffel 65 is an Italian three-piece eurodance group formed in 1998 and best known for pioneering in pitch-correction and autotune, and for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)". Their other hit singles include "Move Your Body" and "Too Much of Heaven", all of which appeared on their album Europop, released in late 1999. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Bloom06_Ostia.jpg/267px-Bloom06_Ostia.jpg
