57.2	Serial_Attached_SCSI	Serial attached SCSI	Serial Attached SCSI is a computer bus used to move data to and from computer storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives. SAS depends on a point-to-point serial protocol that replaces the parallel SCSI bus technology that first appeared in the mid 1980s in data centers and workstations, and it uses the standard SCSI command set. SAS offers backwards-compatibility with second-generation SATA drives. SATA 3 Gbit/s drives may be connected to SAS backplanes, but SAS drives may not be connected to SATA backplanes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Sas_niveles_en.gif/220px-Sas_niveles_en.gif
