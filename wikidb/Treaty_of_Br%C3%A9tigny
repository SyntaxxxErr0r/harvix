18.33	Treaty_of_Br%C3%A9tigny	Treaty of Brétigny	The Treaty of Brétigny was a treaty signed on 9 May 1360, between King Edward III of England and King John II (the Good) of France. In retrospect it is seen as having marked the end of the first phase of the Hundred Years' War —as well as the height of English hegemony on the Continent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Trait%C3%A9_de_Bretigny.svg/250px-Trait%C3%A9_de_Bretigny.svg.png
