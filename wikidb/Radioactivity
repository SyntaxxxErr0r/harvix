54.6	Radioactivity	Radioactive decay	Radioactive decay is the process by which an atomic nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting ionizing particles . The emission is spontaneous, in that the atom decays without any physical interaction with another particle from outside the atom. Usually, radioactive decay happens due to a process confined to the nucleus of the unstable atom, but, on occasion (as with the different processes of electron capture and internal conversion), an inner electron of the radioactive atom is also necessary to the process.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Alpha_Decay.svg/220px-Alpha_Decay.svg.png
