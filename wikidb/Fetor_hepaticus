4.12	Fetor_hepaticus	Fetor hepaticus	Fetor hepaticus or foetor hepaticus (see spelling differences), also known as breath of the dead, is a condition seen in portal hypertension where portosystemic shunting allows mercaptans to pass directly into the lungs. It is a late sign in liver failure. Other possible causes are the presence of ammonia and ketones in the breath. The breath has a sweet, faecal smell to it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Dimethyl_sulfide_structure.svg/220px-Dimethyl_sulfide_structure.svg.png
