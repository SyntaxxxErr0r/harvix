80.4	Crunk	Crunk	Crunk is a music style that originated in Memphis, Tennessee in the mid-to-late 1990s and gained mainstream success around 2003â€“2004. Performers of crunk music are sometimes referred to as crunksters. An archetypal crunk track most frequently uses a drum machine rhythm, heavy bassline, and shouting vocals, often in call and response manner. The term crunk is also used as a blanket term to denote any style of southern hip hop, a side effect of the genre's breakthrough to the mainstream.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Lil_Jon.jpg/220px-Lil_Jon.jpg
