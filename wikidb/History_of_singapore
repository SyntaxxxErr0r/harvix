2.10	History_of_singapore	History of Singapore	The history of Singapore dates to the 11th century. The island rose in importance during the 14th century under the rule of Srivijayan prince Parameswara and became an important port until it was destroyed by Acehnese raiders in 1613. The modern history of Singapore began in 1819 when Englishman Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles established a British port on the island. Under British colonial rule, it grew in importance as a centre for both the India-China trade and the entrep√¥t trade in Southeast Asia, rapidly becoming a major port city.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Flag_of_Singapore.svg/85px-Flag_of_Singapore.svg.png
