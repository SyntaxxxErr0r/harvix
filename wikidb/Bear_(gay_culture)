77.1	Bear_(gay_culture)	Bear (gay culture)	Bears are heavy-set men and are often characterized as having hairy bodies and facial hair; some are also muscular; some project an image of rugged masculinity in their grooming and appearance. Some bears place importance on presenting a hypermasculine image and may shun interaction with, and even disdain, men who exhibit effeminacy. The bear concept can function as an identity, an affiliation, and there is ongoing debate in bear communities about what constitutes a bear, however a consensus exists that inclusion is an important part of the bear community.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Ibr2007.jpg/220px-Ibr2007.jpg
