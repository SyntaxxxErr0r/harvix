1.10	Tatun_Volcano_Group	Tatun Volcano Group	Tatun Volcanoes (Chinese: ), a volcanic group of volcanoes located at northern Taiwan, is located 15 km north of Taipei, and lies to the west of Keelung. It just adjoins the northern coast of the Taiwan island. The volcano group was a result of episodic volcanisms between 2.8 and 0.2 Ma. Currently, some hydrothermal activities and gas fumaroles are still active among these volcanoes. Observations on Tatun Volcano Group suggest that magma chambers probably still exist under the land surface of northern Taiwan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Chihsingshan%2C_Tatun_volcanoes.jpg/265px-Chihsingshan%2C_Tatun_volcanoes.jpg
