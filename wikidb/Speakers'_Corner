101.7	Speakers'_Corner	Speakers' Corner	A Speakers' Corner is an area where open-air public speaking, debate and discussion are allowed. The original and most noted is in the north-east corner of Hyde Park in London, United Kingdom. Speakers there may speak on any subject, as long as the police consider their speeches lawful, although this right is not restricted to Speakers' Corner only. Contrary to popular belief, there is no immunity from the law, nor are any subjects proscribed, but in practice the police tend to be tolerant and therefore intervene only when they receive a complaint or if they hear profanity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Speaker%27s_Corner_Speaker.jpg/350px-Speaker%27s_Corner_Speaker.jpg
