Coincidence detectors are important in information processing by reducing temporal jitter, reducing spontaneous activity, and forming associations between separate neural events. This concept has led to a greater understanding of neural processes and the formation of computational maps in the brain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Spatial_summation.JPG/220px-Spatial_summation.JPG
