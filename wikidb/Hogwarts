98.7	Hogwarts	Hogwarts	Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry or simply Hogwarts is the primary setting for the first six books of the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, with each book lasting the equivalent of one school year. It is a fictional British boarding school of magic for witches and wizards between the ages of eleven and seventeen. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, however, most of the book is set outside Hogwarts as main characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger do not attend their final year of school (though Rowling has stated that Hermione eventually returns to school to complete her N.E.W.T. examinations). The climactic battle of the book, and the series, however, is set at Hogwarts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/Hog2warts.jpg/300px-Hog2warts.jpg
