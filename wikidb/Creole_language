79.9	Creole_language	Creole language	The vocabulary of a creole language consists of cognates from the parent languages, though there are often clear phonetic and semantic shifts. On the other hand, the grammar often has original features but may differ substantially from those of the parent languages. Most often, the vocabulary comes from the dominant group and the grammar from the subordinate group, where such stratification exists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Guadeloupe_creole_2010-03-30.JPG/220px-Guadeloupe_creole_2010-03-30.JPG
