6.41	Black_Museum	Black Museum	The Black Museum of Scotland Yard is a famed collection of criminal memorabilia kept at the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police in London, England. The museum came into existence sometime in 1874, although unofficially. It was housed at Scotland Yard, and grew from the collection of prisoners' property gathered under the authority of the Prisoners Property Act of 1869. The act was intended to help the police in their study of crime and criminals. By 1875, it had become an official museum of the force, with a police inspector and a police constable assigned to duty there. The first visitors for whom records exist came in 1877. The first known reference to the museum as the "Black Museum" came that year as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/New_Scotland_Yard_sign_3.jpg/210px-New_Scotland_Yard_sign_3.jpg
