6.21	Jenin_Massacre	Battle of Jenin	The Battle of Jenin (April 1â€“11, 2002) took place in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered the camp, and other areas under the administration of the Palestinian Authority, during the Second Intifada, as part of Operation Defensive Shield. The Jenin camp was targeted after Israel determined that it had "served as a launch site for numerous terrorist attacks against both Israeli civilians and Israeli towns and villages in the area."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b0/City_of_Jenin_and_refugee_camp.jpg/300px-City_of_Jenin_and_refugee_camp.jpg
