The station was established in 1889 by the Spanish government. With the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, the lighthouse would become "the most important aid to navigation on the route from Europe to Panama". In 1917, the U.S Congress provided funding for a new lighthouse in higher ground.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Punta_Borinquen_Lighthouse.JPG/220px-Punta_Borinquen_Lighthouse.JPG
