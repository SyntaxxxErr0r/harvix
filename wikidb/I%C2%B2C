52.0	I%C2%B2C	I²C	I²C uses only two bidirectional open-drain lines, Serial Data Line (SDA) and Serial Clock (SCL), pulled up with resistors. Typical voltages used are +5 V or +3.3 V although systems with other voltages are permitted.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/I2C.svg/350px-I2C.svg.png
