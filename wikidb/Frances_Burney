She was born in Lynn Regis, now King’s Lynn, England, on 13 June 1752, to musical historian Dr Charles Burney (1726–1814) and Mrs Esther Sleepe Burney (1725–62). The third of six children, she was self-educated and began writing what she called her “scribblings” at the age of ten. In 1793, aged forty-two, she married a French exile, General Alexandre D'Arblay. Their only son, Alexander, was born in 1794. After a lengthy writing career, and travels that took her to France for more than ten years, she settled in Bath, England, where she died on 6 January 1840.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Frances_d%27Arblay_%28%27Fanny_Burney%27%29_by_Edward_Francisco_Burney.jpg/250px-Frances_d%27Arblay_%28%27Fanny_Burney%27%29_by_Edward_Francisco_Burney.jpg
