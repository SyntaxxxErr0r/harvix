After rising during the 1990s, with 1.4 million tourists in 1999, industry figures described a 75% fall in visitors to Zimbabwe in by December 2000, with less than 20% of hotel rooms occupied. This has had a huge impact on the Zimbabwean economy, where thousands of jobs were lost due to companies closing down or simply being unable to pay staff wages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/Tourism_in_Zimbabwe_logo.jpg/100px-Tourism_in_Zimbabwe_logo.jpg
