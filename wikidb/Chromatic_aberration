75.1	Chromatic_aberration	Chromatic aberration	In optics, chromatic aberration (CA, also called achromatism or chromatic distortion) is a type of distortion in which there is a failure of a lens to focus all colors to the same convergence point. It occurs because lenses have a different refractive index for different wavelengths of light (the dispersion of the lens). The refractive index decreases with increasing wavelength.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Chromatic_aberration_%28comparison%29.jpg/220px-Chromatic_aberration_%28comparison%29.jpg
