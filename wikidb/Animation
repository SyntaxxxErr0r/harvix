149.4	Animation	Animation	Animation is the rapid display of a sequence of images of 2-D or 3-D artwork or model positions to create an illusion of movement. The effect is an optical illusion of motion due to the phenomenon of persistence of vision, and can be created and demonstrated in several ways. The most common method of presenting animation is as a motion picture or video program, although there are other methods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Animexample3edit.png
