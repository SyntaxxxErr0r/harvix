70.7	Scoliosis	Scoliosis	Scoliosis (from Greek: "crooked") is a medical condition in which a person's spine is curved from side to side. Although it is a complex three-dimensional deformity, on an X-ray, viewed from the rear, the spine of an individual with scoliosis may look more like an "S" or a "C" than a straight line. Scoliosis is typically classified as either congenital (caused by vertebral anomalies present at birth), idiopathic (cause unknown, subclassified as infantile, juvenile, adolescent, or adult, according to when onset occurred), or neuromuscular (having developed as a secondary symptom of another condition, such as spina bifida, cerebral palsy, spinal muscular atrophy, or physical trauma. A lesser known underlying cause of scoliosis could be attributed to a condition called Chiari malformation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Scoliosis_cobb.gif
