57.1	Donatello	Donatello	Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi (circa 1386 – December 13, 1466), also known as Donatello, was an early Renaissance Italian artist and sculptor from Florence. He is, in part, known for his work in bas-relief, a form of shallow relief sculpture that, in Donatello's case, incorporated significant 15th century developments in perspectival illusionism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Uffizi_Donatello.jpg/220px-Uffizi_Donatello.jpg
