3.00	Cocinero	Cocinero	The cocinero, Caranx vinctus (also known as the barred jack and striped jack), is a species of small marine fish classified in the jack family, Carangidae. The cocinero is distributed through the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, ranging along the west American coastline from Baja California in the north to Peru in the south. It is a pelagic species, inhabiting the upper water column in both coastal and offshore oceanic waters, occasionally making its way into estuaries. The species may be identified by its colouration, having 8 or 9 incomplete dark vertical stripes on its sides, with scute and gill raker counts also diagnostic. It is small compared to most other species of Caranx, reaching a length of 37 cm in total. The cocinero is a predatory fish, taking small fishes, crustaceans, as well as various benthic invertebrates in shallower waters. Little is known of the species reproductive habits. The cocinero is of moderate importance to fisheries along the west coast of South America, and the species has been used in aquaculture trials. It is taken by various netting methods and by spear, and is sold fresh, dried and salted at market.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Cocinero-Caranx_vinctus.png/240px-Cocinero-Caranx_vinctus.png
