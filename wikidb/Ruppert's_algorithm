1.00	Ruppert's_algorithm	Ruppert's algorithm	In mesh generation, Ruppert's algorithm, also known as Delaunay refinement, is an algorithm for creating quality Delaunay triangulations. The algorithm takes a planar straight-line graph (or in dimension higher than two a piecewise linear system) and returns a conforming Delaunay triangulation of only quality triangles. A triangle is considered poor-quality if it has a circumradius to shortest edge ratio larger than some prescribed threshold. Discovered by Jim Ruppert in the early 1990s, "Ruppert's algorithm for two-dimensional quality mesh generation is perhaps the first theoretically guaranteed meshing algorithm to be truly satisfactory in practice."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/RuppertsAlgorithm-input.png/350px-RuppertsAlgorithm-input.png
