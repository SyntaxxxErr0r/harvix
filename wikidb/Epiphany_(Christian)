56.3	Epiphany_(Christian)	Epiphany (holiday)	Epiphany or Theophany (Ancient Greek (ἡ) Θεοφάνεια, Τheophaneia meaning "vision of God"), which traditionally falls on 6 January, is a Christian feast day that celebrates the revelation of God the Son as a human being in Jesus Christ. Western Christians commemorate principally (but not solely) the visitation of the Biblical Magi to the Baby Jesus, and thus Jesus' physical manifestation to the Gentiles. Eastern Christians commemorate the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River, seen as his manifestation to the world as the Son of God.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/WiseMenAdorationMurillo.png/220px-WiseMenAdorationMurillo.png
