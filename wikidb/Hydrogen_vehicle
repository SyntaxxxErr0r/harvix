57.0	Hydrogen_vehicle	Hydrogen vehicle	A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen fueled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine, or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/FCX_Clarity.jpg/250px-FCX_Clarity.jpg
