8.61	Operation_Hannibal	Operation Hannibal	Operations commenced on January 23, 1945, running the gauntlet of British aerial-laid mines and Soviet aircraft, small naval units, and submarines operating in the Baltic. In the process of the evacuation, German navy ships bombarded Russian armor and infantry columns, firing more shells during the operation than they had in the previous five years of war and inflicting thousands of casualties on the pursuing Russians.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1972-092-05%2C_Flucht_aus_Ostpreu%C3%9Fen.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1972-092-05%2C_Flucht_aus_Ostpreu%C3%9Fen.jpg
