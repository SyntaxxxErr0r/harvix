56.1	Adobe_Acrobat	Adobe Acrobat	Adobe Acrobat is a family of application software developed by Adobe Systems to view, create, manipulate, print and manage files in Portable Document Format (PDF). All members of the family, except Adobe Reader (formerly Acrobat Reader), are proprietary commercial software, while the latter is available as freeware and can be downloaded from Adobe's web site. Adobe Reader enables users to view and print PDF files but has negligible PDF creation capabilities. Acrobat and Reader are widely used as a way to present information with a fixed layout similar to a paper publication.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/Adobe_Reader_X_on_Windows_7.png/300px-Adobe_Reader_X_on_Windows_7.png
