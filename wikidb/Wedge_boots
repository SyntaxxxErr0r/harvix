4.14	Wedge_boots	Wedge boots	Wedge boots or wedgies are boots with a sole in the form of a wedge so that one piece of material, normally rubber, serves as both the sole and the heel. Wedge boots are more common for women and often have a sole that is much thicker at the back than the front, making it a high-heel shoe or boot. Men's wedge boots, not normally called "wedgies", usually have a low heel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Pink_wedge-heeled_sandals.jpg/220px-Pink_wedge-heeled_sandals.jpg
