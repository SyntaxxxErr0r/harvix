21.00	USS_Saratoga_(CV-3)	USS Saratoga (CV-3)	USS Saratoga (CV-3) was the second aircraft carrier of the United States Navy and the fifth ship to bear her name. She was commissioned one month earlier than her sister ship, Lexington, which was the third actually commissioned after Langley and Saratoga. As Saratoga was visually identical to Lexington, her funnel was painted with a large black vertical stripe to assist pilots in recognizing her. Saratoga, Enterprise, and Ranger were the only fleet aircraft carriers of the United States Navy built before the war to survive and serve throughout the U.S. involvement in World War II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/USS_Saratoga_CV-3_underway_1942.jpg/300px-USS_Saratoga_CV-3_underway_1942.jpg
