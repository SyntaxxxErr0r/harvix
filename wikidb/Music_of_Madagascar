12.83	Music_of_Madagascar	Music of Madagascar	The highly diverse and distinctive music of Madagascar has been shaped by the musical traditions of Southeast Asia, Africa, Arabia, England, France and the United States as successive waves of settlers have made the island their home. Traditional instruments reflect these widespread origins: the mandoliny and kabosy owe their existence to the introduction of the guitar by early Arab or European seafarers, the ubiquitous djembe originated in mainland Africa and the valiha—the bamboo tube zither considered the national instrument of Madagascar—directly evolved from an earlier form of zither carried with the first Austronesian settlers on their outrigger canoes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Bagasy_musicians_madagascar_valiha_guitar.jpg/300px-Bagasy_musicians_madagascar_valiha_guitar.jpg
