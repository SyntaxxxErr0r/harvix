65.7	Merge_sort	Merge sort	Merge sort is an O comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Neumann as early as 1948.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Merge-sort-example-300px.gif
