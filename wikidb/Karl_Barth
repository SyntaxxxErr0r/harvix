73.1	Karl_Barth	Karl Barth	Karl Barth (May 10, 1886) â€“ December 10, 1968)) was a Swiss Reformed theologian whom critics hold to be among the most important Christian thinkers of the 20th century; Pope Pius XII described him as the most important theologian since Thomas Aquinas. Beginning with his experience as a pastor, he rejected his training in the predominant liberal theology typical of 19th-century European Protestantism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Wikipedia-karlbarth01.jpg/260px-Wikipedia-karlbarth01.jpg
