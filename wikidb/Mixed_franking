1.00	Mixed_franking	Mixed franking	In philately, a mixed franking is an occurrence of postage stamps of more than one country or issuing entity on a single cover â€” or the occurrence of postage stamps of more than one currency of a country or issuing identity on a single cover. Since nearly all countries of the world have agreed to deliver each other's mail, it is unusual to need more than the stamps of the originating country; valid mixed frankings are uncommon and valued by collectors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Cover_Austria_1938-650px.jpg/300px-Cover_Austria_1938-650px.jpg
