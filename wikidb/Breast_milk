51.9	Breast_milk	Human breast milk	Breast milk, to be specific human milk, is the milk produced by the breasts (or mammary glands) of a human female for her infant offspring. Milk is the primary source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods; older infants and toddlers may continue to be breastfed, either exclusively or in combination with other foods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Human_Breastmilk_-_Foremilk_and_Hindmilk.png/400px-Human_Breastmilk_-_Foremilk_and_Hindmilk.png
