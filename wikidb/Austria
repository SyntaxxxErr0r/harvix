341.0	Austria	Austria	The origins of modern-day Austria date back to the time of the Habsburg dynasty when the vast majority of the country was a part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Austria became one of the great powers of Europe and, in response to the coronation of Napoleon I as the Emperor of the French, the Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804. In 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into Austria-Hungary.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_Austria.svg/125px-Flag_of_Austria.svg.png
