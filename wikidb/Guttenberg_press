3.00	Guttenberg_press	Printing press	A printing press is a device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. Typically used for texts, the invention and spread of the printing press are widely regarded as the most influential events in the second millennium AD, revolutionizing the way people conceive and describe the world they live in, and ushering in the period of modernity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Handtiegelpresse_von_1811.jpg/200px-Handtiegelpresse_von_1811.jpg
