290.1	Taxonomy	Taxonomy	Taxonomy (from Greek: "arrangement" and Greek: "method") is the science of identifying and naming species, and arranging them into a classification. The field of taxonomy, sometimes referred to as "biological taxonomy", revolves around the description and use of taxonomic units, known as taxa (singular taxon). A resulting taxonomy is a particular classification ("the taxonomy of ..."), arranged in a hierarchical structure or classification scheme. An example of a modern classification is the one published in 2009 by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group for all living flowering plant families (the APG III system).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Nepenthes_smilesii_type_specimen.jpg/200px-Nepenthes_smilesii_type_specimen.jpg
