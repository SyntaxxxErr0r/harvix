She notably declared "This woman’s place is in the House—the House of Representatives" in her successful 1970 campaign to join that body. She was later appointed to chair the National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year and to plan the 1977 National Women's Conference by President Gerald Ford and led President Jimmy Carter's commission on women. Abzug was also the first Jewish woman elected to the House of Representatives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Bella_Abzug_1971-11-30.jpg/220px-Bella_Abzug_1971-11-30.jpg
