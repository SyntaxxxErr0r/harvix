54.0	Ostinato	Ostinato	Applicable in homophonic and contrapuntal textures they are distinguished as "repetitive rhythmic-harmonic schemes", the more familiar accompanimental melodies, or as purely rhythmic. The technique's appeal to composers from Debussy to avant-garde composers until at least the 1970s "lies in part in the need for unity created by the virtual abandonment of functional chord progressions to shape phrases and define tonality". Similarly in modal music "relentless, repetitive character help to establish and confirm the modal center". Their popularity may also be justified by their ease as well as range of use, though "ostinato must be employed judiciously, as its overuse can quickly lead to monotony".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/14/Dido%27s_Lament_ground_bass.png/350px-Dido%27s_Lament_ground_bass.png
