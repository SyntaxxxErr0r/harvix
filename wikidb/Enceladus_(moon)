113.7	Enceladus_(moon)	Enceladus (moon)	Enceladus is named after the Giant Enceladus of Greek mythology. The name Enceladus—like the names of each of the first seven satellites of Saturn to be discovered—was suggested by William Herschel's son John Herschel in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope. He chose these names because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, was the leader of the Titans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/PIA08409_North_Polar_Region_of_Enceladus.jpg/250px-PIA08409_North_Polar_Region_of_Enceladus.jpg
