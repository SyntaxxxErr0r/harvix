78.1	Petrarch	Petrarch	Francesco Petrarca (July 20, 1304 â€“ July 19, 1374), known in English as Petrarch, was an Italian scholar, poet and one of the earliest humanists. Petrarch is often called the "Father of Humanism". In the 16th century, Pietro Bembo created the model for the modern Italian language based on Petrarch's works, as well as those of Giovanni Boccaccio and, especially, Dante Alighieri. This would be later endorsed by the Accademia della Crusca. Petrarch's sonnets were admired and imitated throughout Europe during the Renaissance and became a model for lyrical poetry. He is also known for being the first to develop the concept of the "Dark Ages".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Altichiero%2C_ritratto_di_francesco_petrarca.jpg/150px-Altichiero%2C_ritratto_di_francesco_petrarca.jpg
