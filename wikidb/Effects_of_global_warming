75.6	Effects_of_global_warming	Effects of global warming	The effects of global warming are the ecological and social changes caused by the rise in global temperatures. Evidence of climate change includes the instrumental temperature record, rising sea levels, and decreased snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere. Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in human greenhouse gas concentrations. Projections of future climate change suggest further global warming, sea level rise, and an increase in the frequency of some extreme weather events. Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have agreed to implement policies designed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous climate change.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Risks_and_Impacts_of_Global_Warming.png/350px-Risks_and_Impacts_of_Global_Warming.png
