2.10	Broletto	Broletto	Broletto is an ancient Italian word, from medieval Latin "broilum, brogilum", which probably derives from a Celtic word. Its first meaning is "little orchard or garden"; hence the meaning "field surrounded by a wall". Another meaning refers to a "place where justice is administered". This meaning explains why several places or buildings in northern Italy are called "Broletto".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Orta_San_Giulio-Broletto.jpg/220px-Orta_San_Giulio-Broletto.jpg
