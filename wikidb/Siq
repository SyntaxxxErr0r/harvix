15.30	Siq	Siq	al-Siq is the main entrance to the ancient city of Petra in southern Jordan. The dim, narrow gorge (in some points no more than 3 meters wide) winds its way approximately one mile and ends at Petra's most elaborate ruin, Al Khazneh (The Treasury).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/First_Glimpse.jpg/175px-First_Glimpse.jpg
