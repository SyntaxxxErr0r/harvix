57.6	Radiometric_dating	Radiometric dating	All ordinary matter is made up of combinations of chemical elements, each with its own atomic number, indicating the number of protons in the atomic nucleus. Additionally, elements may exist in different isotopes, with each isotope of an element differing in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a nuclide. Some nuclides are inherently unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will spontaneously transform into a different nuclide. This transformation may be accomplished in a number of different ways, including radioactive decay, either by emission of particles (usually electrons , positrons or alpha particles) or by spontaneous fission, and electron capture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Thorium_decay_chain_from_lead-212_to_lead-208.svg/300px-Thorium_decay_chain_from_lead-212_to_lead-208.svg.png
