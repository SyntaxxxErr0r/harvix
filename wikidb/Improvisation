73.7	Improvisation	Improvisation	Improvisation is the practice of acting, singing, talking and reacting, of making and creating, in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one's immediate environment and inner feelings. This can result in the invention of new thought patterns, new practices, new structures or symbols, and/or new ways to act. This invention cycle occurs most effectively when the practitioner has a thorough intuitive and technical understanding of the necessary skills and concerns within the improvised domain. Improvisation can be thought of as an "on the spot" or "off the cuff" spontaneous activity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Improv_austin_2009.jpg/220px-Improv_austin_2009.jpg
