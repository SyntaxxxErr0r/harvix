81.1	Mountaintop_removal_mining	Mountaintop removal mining	Mountaintop removal mining , is a form of surface mining that involves the mining of the summit or summit ridge of a mountain. (Coal industry proponents often refer to MTR as mountaintop mining .) Entire coal seams are removed from the top of a mountain, hill or ridge by removing the overburden above them, and restacking the overburden back on the ridge to reflect the approximate original contour of the mountain. The excess amounts of overburden that can not be placed on the ridge top is moved into neighboring valleys. It is most closely associated with coal mining in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. The process involves blasting with explosives to remove up to 400 vertical feet (120 m) of mountain to expose underlying coal seams. Excess rock and soil laden with toxic mining byproducts are often dumped into nearby valleys, in what are called "holler fills" or "valley fills."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/MTR1.jpg/220px-MTR1.jpg
