54.3	BRCA1	BRCA1	BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset) is a human caretaker gene that produces a protein called breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein, responsible for repairing DNA. The first evidence for the existence of the gene was provided by the King laboratory at UC Berkeley in 1990. Four years later, after an international race to find it, the gene was cloned in 1994 by scientists at Myriad Genetics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Protein_BRCA1_PDB_1jm7.png/250px-Protein_BRCA1_PDB_1jm7.png
