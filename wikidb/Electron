216.7	Electron	Electron	The electron (symbol: ) is a subatomic particle with a negative elementary electric charge. It has no known components or substructure; in other words, it is generally thought to be an elementary particle. An electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. The intrinsic angular momentum of the electron is a half-integer value in units of Ä§, which means that it is a fermion. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign. When an electron collides with a positron, both particles may either scatter off each other or be totally annihilated, producing a pair (or more) of gamma ray photons. Electrons, which belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Electrons, like all matter, have quantum mechanical properties of both particles and waves, so they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. However, this duality is best demonstrated in experiments with electrons, due to their tiny mass. Since an electron is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Crookes_tube-in_use-lateral_view-standing_cross_prPNr%C2%B011.jpg/280px-Crookes_tube-in_use-lateral_view-standing_cross_prPNr%C2%B011.jpg
