6.12	Cannon-Bard_theory	Cannonâ€“Bard theory	Walter Bradford Cannon (1871-1945) was a physiologist at Harvard university, who is perhaps best known for his classic treatise on homeostasis. Philip Bard (1898-1977) was a doctoral student of Cannon's, and together they developed a model of emotion called the Cannon-Bard Theory. Cannon was an ardent experimenter who relied on studies of animal physiology. Through these studies, Cannon and Bard highlighted the role of the brain in generating physiological responses and feelings; a role that is important in their explanation of emotion experience and production. The main assertions of the Cannon-Bard theory are that emotional expression results from the function of hypothalamic structures, and emotional feeling results from stimulations of the dorsal thalamus. The physiological changes and subjective feeling of an emotion in response to a stimulus are separate and independent; arousal does not have to occur before the emotion. Thus, the thalamic region is attributed a major role in this theory of emotion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Serotonergic_neurons.svg/220px-Serotonergic_neurons.svg.png
