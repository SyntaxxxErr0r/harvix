168.1	Robert_Moses	Robert Moses	Robert Moses (December 18, 1888 â€“ July 29, 1981) was the "master builder" of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, Rockland County, and Westchester County, New York. As the shaper of a modern city, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, and is one of the most polarizing figures in the history of urban planning in the United States. He changed shorelines, built bridges, tunnels and roadways, and transformed neighborhoods forever. His decisions favoring highways over public transit helped create the modern suburbs of Long Island and influenced a generation of engineers, architects, and urban planners who spread his philosophies across the nation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Robert_Moses_with_Battery_Bridge_model.jpg/220px-Robert_Moses_with_Battery_Bridge_model.jpg
