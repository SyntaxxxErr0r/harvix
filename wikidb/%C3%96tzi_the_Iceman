99.1	%C3%96tzi_the_Iceman	Ötzi the Iceman	On 19 September 1991, Ötzi was found by two German tourists from Nuremberg, Helmut and Erika Simon, at 3210 m on the east ridge of the Fineilspitze in the Ötztal Alps on the Austrian-Italian border, while walking off the path between the mountain passes Hauslabjoch and Tisenjoch. They believed that the body was of a recently deceased mountaineer. The next day, a mountain gendarme and the keeper of the nearby Similaunhütte first attempted to remove the body, which was frozen in ice below the torso, using a pneumatic drill and ice-axes, but had to give up due to bad weather. The next day, eight groups visited the site, amongst whom happened to be the famous mountaineers Hans Kammerlander and Reinhold Messner. The body was semi-officially extracted on the 22nd and officially salvaged on the 23rd. It was transported to the University of Innsbruck, where it was recognized to be primeval the same day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/OetzitheIceman02.jpg/300px-OetzitheIceman02.jpg
