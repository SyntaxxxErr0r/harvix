52.6	Mad_Hatter	The Hatter	Hatta, the Hatter is a fictional character in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the story's sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. He is often referred to as the Mad Hatter, though this term was never used by Carroll. The phrase "mad as a hatter" pre-dates Carroll's works and the characters the Hatter and the March Hare are initially referred to as "both mad" by the Cheshire Cat, with both first appearing in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, in the seventh chapter titled "A Mad Tea-Party".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/MadlHatterByTenniel.svg/250px-MadlHatterByTenniel.svg.png
