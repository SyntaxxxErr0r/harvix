71.6	Peloton	Peloton	The peloton (from French, literally meaning little ball or platoon and also related to the English word pellet), field, bunch or pack is the large main group of riders in a road bicycle race. Riders in a group save energy by riding close near (particularly behind) other riders. The reduction in drag is dramatic; in the middle of a well-developed group it can be as much as 40%.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/TourDeFrance_2005-07-08.JPG/220px-TourDeFrance_2005-07-08.JPG
