56.0	Squalene	Squalene	Squalene is a natural organic compound originally obtained for commercial purposes primarily from shark liver oil, though plant sources (primarily vegetable oils) are used as well, including amaranth seed, rice bran, wheat germ, and olives. All plants and animals produce squalene, including humans. Squalene has been proposed to be an important part of the Mediterranean diet as it may be a chemopreventative substance that protects people from cancer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Squalene.svg/244px-Squalene.svg.png
