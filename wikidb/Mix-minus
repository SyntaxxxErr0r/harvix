10.00	Mix-minus	Mix-minus	In audio, a mix-minus is a particular setup of a mixing console, such that the output to a certain device contains everything except the input from that device. This prevents echoes or feedback from reverberating or howling and squealing through the broadcast or sound reinforcement system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Audio_n-1.png/250px-Audio_n-1.png
