Most of what exists now was built around 1910, but the pub dates back to 1733 . Dickens referred to it in A Tale Of Two Cities, and the road at the side of the pub through the arch is named Manette Street, after Dr Manette, one of the characters from that book.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Pillars_of_Hercules_-_Soho_-_W1.jpg/260px-Pillars_of_Hercules_-_Soho_-_W1.jpg
