125.3	New_Wave_music	New Wave music	New Wave is a subgenre of rock music that emerged in the mid to late 1970s alongside punk rock. The term at first generally was synonymous with punk rock before being considered a genre in its own right that incorporated aspects of electronic and experimental music, mod subculture, disco and 1960s pop music. New Wave, as a term, has been used to describe all post-punk rock music, yet, it distances itself from other post-punk movements as it displays characteristics common to pop music, rather than the more "arty" post-punk.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Talking_Heads_band1.jpg/300px-Talking_Heads_band1.jpg
