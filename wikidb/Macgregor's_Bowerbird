4.00	Macgregor's_Bowerbird	MacGregor's Bowerbird	The MacGregor's Bowerbird, Amblyornis macgregoriae is a medium-sized, up to 26 cm long, olive brown bowerbird of New Guinea's mountain forests, roughly the size and shape of a robin. The male is adorned with an erectile orange yellow crest, that is partly hidden until shown in courtship display. The unadorned female is similar to the male, but without the crest. Superb mimics, they are known for imitating other birds, pigs, rushing water, and even human speech.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/LoriaMariaeKeulemans.jpg/220px-LoriaMariaeKeulemans.jpg
