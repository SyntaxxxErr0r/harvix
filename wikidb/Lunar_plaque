12.21	Lunar_plaque	Lunar plaque	Lunar plaques are rectangular stainless steel plaques (9" x 7 5/8") attached to the ladders on the descent stages of the American lunar modules used from Apollo 11 through Apollo 17. All of the plaques bear facsimiles of the participating astronauts' signatures. Two of the plaques bear a facsimile of the signature of President Richard Nixon. Only the Apollo 12 lunar plaque does not bear a picture of the Earth (and is textured differently as well). Apollo 17's plaque bears a depiction of the lunar globe in addition to the Earth. The plaques used on Apollo missions 13 through 16 bear the call-sign of the lunar module. All the lunar plaques from Apollo 11-17, except Apollo 13's (not being able to land), were left on the Moon as the remaining marks of their successes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/A11.plaque.jpg/200px-A11.plaque.jpg
