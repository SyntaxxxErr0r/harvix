59.3	DJ_Kool_Herc	DJ Kool Herc	Clive Campbell (born April 16, 1955), also known as Kool Herc, DJ Kool Herc and Kool DJ Herc, is a Jamaican-born DJ who is credited with originating hip hop music, in The Bronx, New York City. His playing of hard funk records of the sort typified by James Brown was an alternative both to the violent gang culture of the Bronx and to the nascent popularity of disco in the 1970s. In response to the reactions of his dancers, Campbell began to isolate the instrumental portion of the record which emphasized the drum beat—the "break"—and switch from one break to another to yet another.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dj_Kool_Herc.jpg/250px-Dj_Kool_Herc.jpg
