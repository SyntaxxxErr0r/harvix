23.64	Wii_Channels	Wii Menu	The Wii Menu (known internally as the System Menu) is the top-level menu interface of the Wii game console. It has four pages, each with a 4:3 grid, and each displaying the current time and date. Available applications, known as "channels", are displayed and can be navigated using the pointer capability of the Wii Remote. The grid is customizable; users can move channels (except for the Disc Channel) amongst the menu's 47 customizable slots by pressing and holding the A and B button while hovering over the channel the user wants to move. By pressing the plus and minus buttons on the Wii Remote users can scroll across accessing these empty slots.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/da/Wiimen.png/300px-Wiimen.png
