15.21	Geometric_primitive	Geometric primitive	The term geometric primitive in computer graphics and CAD systems is used in various senses, with the common meaning of the simplest (i.e. 'atomic' or irreducible) geometric objects that the system can handle (draw, store). Sometimes the subroutines that draw the corresponding objects are called "geometric primitives" as well. The most "primitive" primitives are point and straight line segment, which were all that early vector graphics systems had.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Beetle.svg/340px-Beetle.svg.png
