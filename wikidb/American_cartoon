While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to a typically non-realistic or semi-realistic drawing or painting intended for satire, caricature, or humor, or to the artistic style of such works. An artist who creates cartoons is called a cartoonist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Dr._Seuss_WikiWorld.png/300px-Dr._Seuss_WikiWorld.png
