55.1	Dirac_equation	Dirac equation	In physics, more specifically relativistic quantum mechanics, the Dirac equation is a wave equation, formulated by British physicist Paul Dirac in 1928. It provided a description of elementary spin-Â½ particles, such as electrons, consistent with both the principles of quantum mechanics and the theory of special relativity, and made relativistic corrections to quantum mechanics. It accounted for the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum in a rigorous way. The equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter, antimatter, hitherto unsuspected and unobserved, later discovered experimentally. It also provided a theoretical justification for the introduction of several-component wave functions in Pauli's phenomenological theory of spin. Although Dirac did not at first fully appreciate what his own equation was telling him, his resolute faith in the logic of mathematics as a means to physical reasoning, his explanation of spin as a consequence of the union of quantum mechanics and special relativity, and the eventual discovery of the positron, represents one of the great triumphs of theoretical physics. In hindsight, the Dirac equation can be looked upon as extending the homogeneous photon energy-momentum relation to regimes where it is nonhomogeneous; but, since photons appear to pair produce all known leptons there may be at least three photon types: those that end as kinetic electrons, those that end as kinetic muons and those that end as kinetic tauons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg/220px-Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg.png
