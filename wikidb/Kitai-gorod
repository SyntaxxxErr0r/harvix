6.21	Kitai-gorod	Kitay-gorod	Kitay-gorod , earlier also known as Great Posad (Russian: ), is a business district within Moscow, Russia, encircled by mostly-reconstructed medieval walls. It is separated from the Moscow Kremlin by Red Square. It does not constitute a district (raion), as there are no resident voters, thus, municipal elections are not possible. Rather, the territory is managed directly by Central Administrative Okrug authorities (since 2003).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Manezhnaya.jpg/200px-Manezhnaya.jpg
