113.4	Whale_shark	Whale shark	The whale shark, Rhincodon typus, is a slow-moving filter feeding shark and the largest extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12.65 metres (41.50 ft) and a weight of more than 21.5 tonnes (47,000 lb), and there are unconfirmed reports of considerably larger whale sharks. This distinctively-marked fish is the only member of its genus Rhincodon and its family, Rhincodontidae (called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984), which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The species originated about 60 million years ago.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Whale_shark_Georgia_aquarium.jpg/250px-Whale_shark_Georgia_aquarium.jpg
