73.4	Elgin_Marbles	Elgin Marbles	The Parthenon Marbles, forming a part of the collection known as the Elgin Marbles ( -gin), are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures (mostly by Phidias and his pupils), inscriptions and architectural members that originally were part of the Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens. Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799â€“1803, obtained a controversial permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Acropolis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Elgin_Marbles_British_Museum.jpg/300px-Elgin_Marbles_British_Museum.jpg
