1.00	Johannes_de_Grocheo	Johannes de Grocheio	Almost one-third of Grocheio's treatise is devoted to liturgical and composed music. The rest is devoted to secular music, and Grocheio surveyed its new social importance in a systematic and pedagogical fashion. Grocheio writes, for example, that "a good fiddler generally performs every kind of cantus and cantilena , and every musical form."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Vielle.jpg
