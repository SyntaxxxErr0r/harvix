62.1	Recombinant_DNA	Recombinant DNA	Molecular cloning is the laboratory process used to create recombinant DNA. It is one of two widely-used methods (along with polymerase chain reaction, abbr. PCR) used to direct the replication of any specific DNA sequence chosen by the experimentalist. The fundamental difference between the two methods is that molecular cloning involves replication of the DNA within a living cell, while PCR replicates DNA in the test tube, free of living cells.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/Recombinant_formation_of_plasmids.svg/280px-Recombinant_formation_of_plasmids.svg.png
