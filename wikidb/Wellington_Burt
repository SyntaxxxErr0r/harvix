4.00	Wellington_Burt	Wellington R. Burt	Wellington R. Burt (August 26, 1831 – March 2, 1919) was a wealthy industrial baron from Saginaw, Michigan. At the time of his death, his wealth was estimated to be between $40 and $90 million. For a time in the early 1900s, Burt ranked as one of the eight wealthiest men in America. He was best known for his lumber mills and timber holdings, but was also involved in iron mining, railroads, salt mines and finances. Burt was a politician, holding the offices of Mayor of East Saginaw (1867–68) and member-elect of the Michigan Senate (1893–94). In his final years, he lived alone in a mansion with his servants. Estranged from friends and family and nicknamed "The Lone Pine of Michigan", he officially died of "senility" at age 87.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Wellington_R._Burt_%28sitting_portrait%29.jpg/200px-Wellington_R._Burt_%28sitting_portrait%29.jpg
