58.4	Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Dead	Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead	Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is an absurdist, existentialist tragicomedy by Tom Stoppard, first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966. The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet, the courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The action of Stoppard's play takes place mainly "in the wings" of Shakespeare's, with brief appearances of major characters from Hamlet who enact fragments of the original's scenes. Between these episodes the two protagonists voice their confusion at the progress of events of which—occurring onstage without them in Hamlet—they have no direct knowledge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Garrick-Left.png/120px-Garrick-Left.png
