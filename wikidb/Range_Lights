1.00	Range_Lights	Leading lights	Leading lights (also known as range lights in the United States) are a pair of light beacons, used in navigation to indicate a safe passage for vessels entering a shallow or dangerous channel; and may also be used for position fixing. At night, the lights are a form of leading line that can be used for safe navigation. The beacons consist of two lights that are separated in distance and elevation, so that when they are aligned, with one above the other, they provide a bearing. Range lights are often illuminated day and night.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/NantucketRangeLites.jpg/220px-NantucketRangeLites.jpg
