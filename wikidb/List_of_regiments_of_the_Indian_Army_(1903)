4.20	List_of_regiments_of_the_Indian_Army_(1903)	List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)	This List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903) is after the Commander-in-Chief, India Lord Kitchener carried out a reform of the Indian Army. These reforms were intended to improve the Indian Army which had been formed from the separate Bengal, Bombay and Madras armies in 1895 (replaced by the Bengal, Bombay, Madras and Punjab commands).The localization of regiments was abolished, and infuture every regiment was to have the opportunity of experiencing frontier conditions.A new method of numbering and designating regiments was introduced. The renumbering went as follows. Bengal regiments retained their existing numbers. The Punjab regiments, less the 5th Gurkhas, were numbered consecutively, adding 50, so that, for example, the 4th Sikh Infantry and the 1st Punjab Infantry became 54th and 55th. The Guides remained unnumbered. Madras regiments added 60 and, since over the years a number of them had been increasingly recruited in the Punjab, this was recognized in their titles, the 30th Madras, for example, becoming the 90th Punjabis. The Hyderabad Contingent regiments were brought into the Line as 94th to 99th. The Bombay regiments added 100, so that the 1st Bombay Grenadiers became the 101st Grenadiers, and so on.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/British_Raj_Red_Ensign.svg/150px-British_Raj_Red_Ensign.svg.png
