3.10	Gypsy_(Mystery_Science_Theater_3000)	Gypsy (Mystery Science Theater 3000)	Gypsy is one of the robot characters on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000. She is larger and less talkative than the other robots. Gypsy normally only appeared during the show's host segments and introduction, but briefly took a seat in the theater to watch the movie in episode #412 . She was only able to deliver a couple of "riffs", and left after realizing how bad the movie was. Along with the other robots, Gypsy was designed and built by series creator Joel Hodgson. He named Gypsy after a pet turtle his brother once owned, as the robot's size and ponderousness reminded him of the turtle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/75/GypsyMST3K.JPG/200px-GypsyMST3K.JPG
