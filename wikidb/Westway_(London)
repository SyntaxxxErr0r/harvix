20.23	Westway_(London)	Westway (London)	The Westway is a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) long elevated dual carriageway section of the A40 route in west London running from Paddington to North Kensington. The road was constructed between 1964 and 1970 to relieve congestion at Shepherd's Bush caused by traffic from Western Avenue struggling to enter central London on roads of insufficient capacity. The Westway opened in July 1970 as the A40(M) motorway but lost motorway status in 2000 when responsibility for trunk roads in Greater London was transferred from the Highways Agency to the Greater London Authority.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Westway_Looking_east.jpg/300px-Westway_Looking_east.jpg
