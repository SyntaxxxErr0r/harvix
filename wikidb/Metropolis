54.9	Metropolis	Metropolis	A metropolis is a very large city or urban area which is a significant economic, political and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections and communications. The term is Greek and means the "mother city" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Manhattan3_amk.jpg/330px-Manhattan3_amk.jpg
