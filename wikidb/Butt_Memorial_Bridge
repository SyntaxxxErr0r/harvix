1.10	Butt_Memorial_Bridge	Butt Memorial Bridge	The Butt Memorial Bridge is a road bridge in Augusta, Georgia dedicated to Major Archibald Willingham Butt, a victim of the sinking of the RMS Titanic. The bridge was erected in 1914 and dedicated by President William Howard Taft, a personal friend of Butt's. It is notable that the bridge was the first memorial erected to remember the Titanic disaster, and it stands today as the only memorial in Georgia dedicated to the disaster. The bridge is made of stone, featuring four pillars topped with bronze-banded globes placed over electric lights. Four lions with plaques adorn each side and end of the bridge, while lights are strung from one end of the bridge to the other. A memorial plaque is located on the center of the bridge, dedicated to Butt's memory. The bridge spans the Augusta Canal at 15th Street in the downtown area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Butt_Bridge_and_Dennis_Cahill_memorial.jpg/250px-Butt_Bridge_and_Dennis_Cahill_memorial.jpg
