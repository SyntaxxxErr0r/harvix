3.40	Jeff_Greinke	Jeff Greinke	Jeff Greinke is an American ambient music and jazz artist and composer currently based in Tucson, Arizona. He is known as one of the pioneers of dark ambient music, with his earlier solo albums often compared to works by Robert Rich, Brian Eno, and Vidna Obmana. Greinke's approach on his ambient works is to heavily layer, mutitrack, and texture soundscapes, effectively using the studio as an instrument.
