1.00	Pyrope_garnet	Pyrope	In hand specimen, pyrope is very tricky to distinguish from almandine, however it is likely to display fewer flaws and inclusions. Other distinguishing criteria are listed in the table to the right. Care should be taken when using these properties as many of those listed have been determined from synthetically grown, pure-composition pyrope. Others, such as pyrope's high specific gravity, may be of little use when studying a small crystal embedded in a matrix of other silicate minerals. In these cases, mineral association with other mafic and ultramafic minerals may be the best indication that the garnet you are studying is pyrope.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Pyrope.jpg/250px-Pyrope.jpg
