3.21	La_Espero	La Espero	"La Espero" ("The Hope") is a poem written by L. L. Zamenhof (1859–1917), the initiator of the Esperanto language. The song is often used as the anthem of Esperanto, and is now usually sung to a triumphal march composed by Félicien Menu de Ménil in 1909 (although there is an earlier, less martial tune created in 1891 by Claes Adelsköld, as well as a number of others less well-known). It is sometimes referred to as the hymn of the Esperanto movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/1908-kl-t-zamenhof.jpg/220px-1908-kl-t-zamenhof.jpg
