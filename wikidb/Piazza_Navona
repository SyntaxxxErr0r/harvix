61.9	Piazza_Navona	Piazza Navona	Piazza Navona is a city square in Rome, Italy. It is built on the site of the Stadium of Domitian, built in 1st century AD, and follows the form of the open space of the stadium. The ancient Romans came there to watch the agones ("games"), and hence it was known as 'Circus Agonalis' (competition arena). It is believed that over time the name changed to 'in agone' to 'navone' and eventually to 'navona'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Piazza_Navona_1.jpg/220px-Piazza_Navona_1.jpg
