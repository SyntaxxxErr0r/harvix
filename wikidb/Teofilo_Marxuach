1.10	Teofilo_Marxuach	Teófilo Marxuach	Lieutenant Colonel Teófilo Marxuach, (July 28, 1877–November 8, 1939), was the person who ordered the first shot fired in World War I on behalf of the United States on an armed German supply ship trying to force its way out of the San Juan Bay. Marxuach fired a hostile shot from a cannon located at the Santa Rosa battery of "El Morro" fort, in what is considered to be the first shot of World War I fired by the regular armed forces of the United States against any ship flying the colors of the Central Powers, forcing the Odenwald to stop and to return to port where its supplies were confiscated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ad/Teofilo_Marxuach.jpg/150px-Teofilo_Marxuach.jpg
