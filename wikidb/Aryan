57.7	Aryan	Aryan	Aryan is an English language loanword derived from the Sanskrit ƒÅrya ('Noble'). In present-day academia, the terms "Indo-Iranian" and "Indo-European" have, according to many, made most uses of the term 'Aryan' minimal, and 'Aryan' is now mostly limited to its appearance in the term "Indo-Aryan" to represent (speakers of) North, West and Central Indian languages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Darius_I_the_Great%27s_inscription_crop.jpg/275px-Darius_I_the_Great%27s_inscription_crop.jpg
