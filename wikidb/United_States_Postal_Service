96.0	United_States_Postal_Service	United States Postal Service	The United States Postal Service (also known as USPS, the Post Office or U.S. Mail) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for providing postal service in the United States. It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution. The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress, where Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general. The cabinet-level Post Office Department was created in 1792 from Franklin's operation and transformed into its current form in 1971 under the Postal Reorganization Act.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/United_States_Postal_Service_Logo.svg/250px-United_States_Postal_Service_Logo.svg.png
