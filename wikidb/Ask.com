55.0	Ask.com	Ask.com	Ask (sometimes known as Ask Jeeves) is a Q&amp;A focused search engine founded in 1996 by Garrett Gruener and David Warthen in Berkeley, California. The original software was implemented by Gary Chevsky from his own design. Warthen, Chevsky, Justin Grant, and others built the early AskJeeves.com website around that core engine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Ask.com_homepage_screenshot.png/250px-Ask.com_homepage_screenshot.png
