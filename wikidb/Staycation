107.0	Staycation	Staycation	A staycation (also spelled stay-cation, stacation, or staykation) is a neologism for a period in which an individual or family stays and relaxes at home, possibly taking day trips to area attractions. Staycations achieved popularity in the US during the financial crisis of 2007â€“2010. Staycations also became a popular phenomenon in the UK in 2009 as a weak pound made overseas holidays significantly more expensive. The term was added to the 2009 version of the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/KiddiePoolJ97.jpg/300px-KiddiePoolJ97.jpg
