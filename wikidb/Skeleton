51.4	Skeleton	Skeleton	The skeleton (From Greek σκελετός, skeletos = "dried-body", "mummy") is the body part that forms the supporting structure of an organism. There are two different skeletal types: the exoskeleton, which is the stable outer shell of an organism, and the endoskeleton, which forms the support structure inside the body.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Horse_and_Man.jpg/220px-Horse_and_Man.jpg
