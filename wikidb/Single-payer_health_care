67.5	Single-payer_health_care	Single-payer health care	Single-payer health care is medical care funded from a single insurance pool, run by the state. Single-payer is a form of monopsony: a market in which one buyer faces many sellers. Single-payer is not the same as universal health care (it is possible to have either without the other). A single-payer-universal-health-care plan for an entire population can be financed from a pool to which many parties—employees, employers, and the state—have contributed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/PNHP_poster.jpg/220px-PNHP_poster.jpg
