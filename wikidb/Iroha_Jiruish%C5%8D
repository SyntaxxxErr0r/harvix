2.00	Iroha_Jiruish%C5%8D	Iroha Jiruishō	Most of these 21 headings are self-explanatory semantic fields, with the exceptions of 13 Jiji for miscellaneous words written with a single character, 14 Jūten reduplicative compounds (e.g., ji-ji 時時, literally "time time", "at times, occasionally"), and 15 Jōji synonym compounds (e.g., kanryaku 簡略, literally "simple simple", "simplicity, conciseness"). It is interesting to compare these 21 Iroha jiruishō headings with the 24 used two centuries earlier in the Wamyō Ruijushō.
