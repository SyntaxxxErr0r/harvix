65.9	Liquefied_petroleum_gas	Liquefied petroleum gas	Liquefied petroleum gas (also called LPG, GPL, LP Gas, or liquid propane gas) is a flammable mixture of hydrocarbon gases used as a fuel in heating appliances and vehicles. It is increasingly used as an aerosol propellant and a refrigerant, replacing chlorofluorocarbons in an effort to reduce damage to the ozone layer. When specifically used as a vehicle fuel it is often referred to as autogas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/LPG_cylinders.JPG/220px-LPG_cylinders.JPG
