4.10	Erotic_Review	Erotic Review	Erotic Review is a monthly UK-based lifestyle publication. Covering eroticism and sex-related topics, it was first published in 1995 as a print magazine, migrating to an eZine format in June, 2010. In addition to the monthly magazine, available to paying subscribers as a virtual flipbook (or a downloadable PDF), the magazine's website also featured blogs and reviews available free of charge. Mid-2011 it was decided to change the format once again, dispense with the flipbook and subscriptions and make all current columns, articles and reviews free of charge and so accessible to all.
