104.0	Emancipation_Proclamation	Emancipation Proclamation	The Emancipation Proclamation is an executive order issued by United States President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, during the American Civil War using his war powers. It proclaimed the freedom of slaves in the ten states then in rebellion, thus applying to 3.1 million of the 4 million slaves in the U.S. at that time. The Proclamation immediately freed 50,000 slaves, with nearly all the rest (of the 3.1 million) freed as Union armies advanced. The Proclamation did not compensate the owners, did not itself outlaw slavery, and did not make the ex-slaves (called freedmen) citizens.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Stephens-reading-proclamation-1863.jpeg/220px-Stephens-reading-proclamation-1863.jpeg
