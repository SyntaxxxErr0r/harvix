70.7	Marzipan	Marzipan	Marzipan is a confection consisting primarily of sugar and almond meal. Persipan is a similar, yet less expensive product, in which the almonds are replaced by apricot or peach kernels. Many confectionery products sold as marzipan are made from less expensive materials, such as soy paste and almond essence. German marzipan is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste, and French marzipan (called 'massepain') is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup. Some marzipan is flavored with rosewater. Spanish marzipan is made without bitter almonds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Fruit_shaped_marzipan_1410687_nevit.jpg/300px-Fruit_shaped_marzipan_1410687_nevit.jpg
