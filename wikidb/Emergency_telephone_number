56.1	Emergency_telephone_number	Emergency telephone number	In many countries the public telephone network has a single emergency telephone number (sometimes known as the universal emergency telephone number or occasionally the emergency services number) that allows a caller to contact local emergency services for assistance. The emergency number differs from country to country; it is typically a three-digit number so that it can be easily remembered and dialed quickly. Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services; these often differ only by the last digit. In the European Union, '112' was introduced as a common emergency call number during the 1990s, and as the GSM standard it is now a well known emergency number across the globe alongside the North American '911' and the British '999'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/911sign.jpg/250px-911sign.jpg
