4.20	Air_Mail_scandal	Air Mail scandal	U.S. air mail operations began in August 1918, after starting in the United States Army Air Service in May of the same year, with pilots and airplanes belonging to the United States Post Office. For nine years, using mostly war-surplus de Havilland DH.4 biplanes, the Post Office built and flew a nationwide network. In the beginning the work was extremely dangerous; of the initial 40 pilots, three died in crashes in 1919 and nine more in 1920. It was 1922 before an entire year ensued without a fatal crash.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/EarlyDH4.jpg/220px-EarlyDH4.jpg
