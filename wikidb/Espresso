104.7	Espresso	Espresso	Espresso is a concentrated beverage brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso often has a thicker consistency than coffee brewed by other methods, a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and crema . As a result of the pressurized brewing process the flavours and chemicals in a typical cup of coffee are very concentrated. Espresso is the base for other drinks, such as a latte, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha, or americano. Espresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most beverages, but the usual serving size is smallerâ€”a 30 mL (1 US fluid ounce) shot of espresso has 40 to 75 mg of caffeine, which is about half the caffeine of a standard 240 mL (8 US fluid ounces) cup of drip-brewed coffee. A professional operator of an espresso machine is a barista, the Italian word for bartender.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Linea_doubleespresso.jpg/220px-Linea_doubleespresso.jpg
