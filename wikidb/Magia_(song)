2.10	Magia_(song)	Magia (Shakira album)	Magia (English: ) is the official debut album by Colombian musician Shakira. The songs are a collection of material written by Shakira from the age of eight onwards. However, the release was hampered by a lack of recording and production cohesion, and therefore did not do well commercially. The album was released under Sony Music Colombia on June 24, 1991. Only 1,200 copies of the album were sold, making it a sought-after collector's item. For this reason, it is officially a promotional album - it is not considered an official album from Shakira's discography, as it is no longer available.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Shakira-Magia.jpg/220px-Shakira-Magia.jpg
