2.00	Hearer	Pederasty in ancient Greece	Pederasty in ancient Greece was a socially acknowledged relationship between an adult male and a younger male usually in his teens. It was characteristic of the Archaic and Classical periods. Some scholars locate its origin in initiation ritual, particularly rites of passage on Crete, where it was associated with entrance into military life and the religion of Zeus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/WallPaintingTomb_Paestum_Italy_GreekColony_sm.jpg/300px-WallPaintingTomb_Paestum_Italy_GreekColony_sm.jpg
