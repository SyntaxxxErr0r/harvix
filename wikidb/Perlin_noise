60.1	Perlin_noise	Perlin noise	Perlin noise is a procedural texture primitive, a type of gradient noise used by visual effects artists to increase the appearance of realism in computer graphics. The function has a pseudo-random appearance, yet all of its visual details are the same size (see image). This property allows it to be readily controllable; multiple scaled copies of Perlin noise can be inserted into mathematical expressions to create a great variety of procedural textures. Synthetic textures using Perlin noise are often used in CGI to make computer-generated visual elements - such as fire, smoke, or clouds - appear more natural, by imitating the controlled random appearance of textures of nature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Perlin_noise.jpg
