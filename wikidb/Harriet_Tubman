After escaping from slavery, into which she was born, she made thirteen missions to rescue more than 70 slaves using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She later helped John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry, and in the post-war era struggled for women's suffrage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Harriet_Tubman_by_Squyer%2C_NPG%2C_c1885.jpg/200px-Harriet_Tubman_by_Squyer%2C_NPG%2C_c1885.jpg
