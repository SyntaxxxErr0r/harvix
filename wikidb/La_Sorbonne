4.00	La_Sorbonne	University of Paris	The University of Paris founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon. In fact, the university as such was older and was never completely centered on the Sorbonne. Of the 13 current successor universities, the first four have a presence in the historical Sorbonne building, and three include "Sorbonne" in their names.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Armes_de_l_universite_de_paris.png/220px-Armes_de_l_universite_de_paris.png
