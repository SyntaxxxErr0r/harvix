89.1	Voltage	Voltage	Voltage, otherwise known as electrical potential difference or electric tension (denoted ∆V and measured in volts, or joules per coulomb) is the potential difference between two points — or the difference in electric potential energy per unit charge between two points. Voltage is equal to the work which would have to be done, per unit charge, against a static electric field to move the charge between two points. A voltage may represent either a source of energy , or it may represent lost or stored energy (potential drop). A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage (or potential difference) between two points in a system; usually a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points. Voltage can be caused by static electric fields, by electric current through a magnetic field, by time-varying magnetic fields, or a combination of all three.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/US_Navy_110315-N-0278E-002_High-voltage_electricians_from_Naval_Facilities_Engineering_Command_%28NAVFAC%29_Hawaii_reconfigure_electrical_circuitry_and.jpg/220px-US_Navy_110315-N-0278E-002_High-voltage_electricians_from_Naval_Facilities_Engineering_Command_%28NAVFAC%29_Hawaii_reconfigure_electrical_circuitry_and.jpg
