3.00	Repetition_(learning)	Rote learning	Rote learning is a learning technique which focuses on memorization without the use of meaning as a basis to store information. The major practice involved in rote learning is learning by repetition by which students commit information to memory in a highly structured way. The idea is that one will be able to quickly recall the meaning of the material the more one repeats it. Some of the alternatives to rote learning include meaningful learning, associative learning, and active learning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Madrasah_pupils_in_Mauritania.jpg/220px-Madrasah_pupils_in_Mauritania.jpg
