8.20	Black_conservatism_in_the_United_States	Black conservatism in the United States	Black conservatism in the United States is a political and social movement rooted in communities of African descent that aligns largely with the American conservative movement. Since the Civil Rights Movement in the latter 20th Century, the African-American community has generally fallen to the left of the right-wing conservative movement, and has predominantly favored itself on the side of liberalism and civil rights progressives. Black conservatism emphasizes traditionalism, strong patriotism, capitalism, free markets, and strong social conservatism within the context of the black church.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Booker_T_Washington_retouched_flattened-crop.jpg/140px-Booker_T_Washington_retouched_flattened-crop.jpg
