77.7	Anne_of_Green_Gables	Anne of Green Gables	Anne of Green Gables is a bestselling novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery published in 1908. It was written as fiction for readers of all ages, but in recent decades has been considered a children's book. Montgomery found her inspiration for the book on an old piece of paper that she had written at a young age, describing a couple that were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of a boy, yet decided to keep her. Montgomery also drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New Yorkâ€™s Metropolitan Magazine, and pasted the framed clipping on the wall of her bedroom, as the model for the face of Anne Shirley, the book's main character.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Montgomery_Anne_of_Green_Gables.jpg/200px-Montgomery_Anne_of_Green_Gables.jpg
