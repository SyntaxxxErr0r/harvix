67.5	Bonnie_Raitt	Bonnie Raitt	1977's Sweet Forgiveness gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough when it yielded a hit single in her cover of Del Shannon's "Runaway." Recast as a heavy R&amp;B recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by Al Green, Raitt's version of "Runaway" was disparaged by many critics, but its commercial success prompted a bidding war between Warner Bros. and Columbia Records. "There was this big Columbia – Warner war going on at the time", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. "James Taylor had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia...And then, Warner signed Paul Simon away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia — no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Bonnie_Raitt_at_John_Edwards_presidential_campaign.jpg/267px-Bonnie_Raitt_at_John_Edwards_presidential_campaign.jpg
