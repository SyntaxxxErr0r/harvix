1.00	Ravioles	Ravioli	Ravioli (plural; singular: raviolo) are a traditional type of Italian filled pasta. They are composed of a filling sealed between two layers of thin egg pasta dough and are served either in broth or with a pasta sauce. The word ravioli is reminiscent of the Italian verb riavvolgere ("to wrap"), though the two words are not etymologically connected. The word may also be a diminutive of Italian dialectal rava, or turnip.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Ravioli_2.jpg/300px-Ravioli_2.jpg
