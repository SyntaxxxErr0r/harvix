249.8	Bookmarklet	Bookmarklet	A bookmarklet is unobtrusive JavaScript stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. The term is a portmanteau of the terms bookmark and applet , however, an applet is not to be confused with a bookmarklet, just as JavaScript is not to be confused with Java. Whether bookmarklet utilities are stored as bookmarks or hyperlinks, they are designed to add one-click functionality to a browser or web page. When clicked, a bookmarklet performs some function, one of a wide variety such as a search query or data extraction. Usually the applet is a JavaScript program.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Word_count_bookmarklet.png/220px-Word_count_bookmarklet.png
