162.3	The_Hague	The Hague	The Hague is the seat of the Dutch government and parliament, the Supreme Court, and the Council of State, but the city is not the capital of the Netherlands which constitutionally is Amsterdam. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands lives at Huis ten Bosch and works at Noordeinde Palace in The Hague. All foreign embassies in the Netherlands and 150 international organisations are located in the city, including the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, which makes The Hague one of the major cities hosting the United Nations, along with New York, Vienna, Geneva and Nairobi.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/A_square_in_the_center_of_the_Hague.jpg/250px-A_square_in_the_center_of_the_Hague.jpg
