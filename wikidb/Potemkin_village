90.6	Potemkin_village	Potemkin village	Potemkin villages or Potyomkin villages (Russian: Потёмкинские деревни) is an idiom based on an historical myth. According to the myth, there were fake settlements purportedly erected at the direction of Russian minister Grigory Potemkin in order to fool Empress Catherine II during her visit to Crimea in 1787. According to this story, Potemkin, who led the Crimean military campaign, had hollow facades of villages constructed along the desolate banks of the Dnieper River in order to impress the monarch and her entourage with the value of her new conquests, thus enhancing his standing in the empress' eyes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Bothell-fence-3466.jpg/220px-Bothell-fence-3466.jpg
