The battle took place in the neighbourhood of Leuctra, a village in Boeotia in the territory of Thespiae. Theban victory shattered Spartaâ€™s immense influence over the Greek peninsula which Sparta had gained since its victory in the Peloponnesian War.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Leuctra.svg/250px-Leuctra.svg.png
