4.20	Ferrari_375_F1	Ferrari 375 F1	Ferrari achieved the 4.5 L goal of the formula with the 375 F1, two of which debuted at Monza on September 3, 1950. This 4.5 L (4493.73 cc/274 in³) engine produced roughly the same power as its 4.1 L predecessor, but its tractability earned Ascari second place in that debut race. A series of modifications through the 1951 season allowed Ferrari to finally put Alfa Romeo behind it in a Formula One race, with Jose Froilan Gonzalez' victory at Silverstone on July 14 becoming the constructor's first World Championship win. Ascari's wins at the Nürburgring and Monza and strong finishes throughout the season cemented the company's position as a Formula One contender.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/1951_Ferrari_375F1.jpg/250px-1951_Ferrari_375F1.jpg
