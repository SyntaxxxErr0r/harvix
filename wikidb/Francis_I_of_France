During his reign, huge cultural changes took place in France and he has been called France's original Renaissance monarch. His permanent rivalry with the Emperor Charles V for hegemony in Europe was the origin of a long and ruinous military conflict that gave rise to the Protestant revolution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/King_Francis_I_Signature.svg/125px-King_Francis_I_Signature.svg.png
