3.00	United_States-Pakistan_skirmishes	Pakistanâ€“United States skirmishes	The United States and Pakistan have been engaged in several military confrontations and skirmishes inside Pakistan territory. These incidents have involved the U.S. military and NATO-led ISAF forces, who have been present in Afghanistan fighting the War on Terror since 2001, and the Pakistani Armed Forces. Most of the exchanges have been indirect friendly fires, usually started when American-led security forces have intruded into Pakistani territory or airspace.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/CH-47_Chinook_in_Bagram.jpg/220px-CH-47_Chinook_in_Bagram.jpg
