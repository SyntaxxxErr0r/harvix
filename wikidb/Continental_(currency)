13.42	Continental_(currency)	Early American currency	Early American currency went through several stages of development in the colonial and post-Revolutionary history of the United States. Because few coins were minted in the thirteen colonies that became the United States in 1776, foreign coins like the Spanish dollar were widely circulated. Colonial governments sometimes issued paper money to facilitate economic activity. The British Parliament passed Currency Acts in 1751, 1764, and 1773 that regulated colonial paper money.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Pennsylvania_three_pence_note_front.jpg/150px-Pennsylvania_three_pence_note_front.jpg
