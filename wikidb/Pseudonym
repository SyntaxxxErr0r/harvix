74.6	Pseudonym	Pseudonym	A pen name (or nom de plume) is a pseudonym adopted by authors or their publishers, often to conceal their identity. One famous example of this is Samuel Clemens' writing under the pen name Mark Twain. A pen name may be used if a writer's real name is likely to be confused with the name of another writer or notable individual, or if their real name is deemed to be unsuitable. Authors who write in fiction and non-fiction, or in different genres, may use pen names to avoid confusing their readers, as in the case of mathematician Charles Dodgson, who wrote fantasy novels under the pen name Lewis Carroll. Some authors, such as Harold Robbins, use several noms de plume.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Die_junge_George_Sand.jpg/180px-Die_junge_George_Sand.jpg
