97.8	Queensland	Queensland	Queensland was first occupied by Indigenous Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, who arrived at least 40,000 years ago. The first European to land in Queensland was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1607. In 1770, Captain James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia, including Queensland, for Great Britain. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades until the establishment of a penal colony at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. Penal transportation ceased in 1839 and free settlement permitted in 1842, and Queensland was separated from New South Wales, forming a self-governing colony, on 6 June 1859, a date now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Flag_of_Queensland.svg/125px-Flag_of_Queensland.svg.png
