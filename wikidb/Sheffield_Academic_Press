1.01	Sheffield_Academic_Press	Sheffield Academic Press	Sheffield Academic Press was an academic imprint, particularly highly regarded for publications in the fields of biblical studies and religious studies, based at the University of Sheffield. It was launched in the mid-1980s, co-founded by biblical scholars Philip R. Davies and David J. A. Clines. In 2003 it was merged to T&amp;T Clark, an imprint of Continuum International Publishing Group. The success of the press was due in no small part to the volume of editorial work done by the two founding editors, as well as several of their editorial staff, notably David Orton and Stanley Porter.
