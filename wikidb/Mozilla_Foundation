95.4	Mozilla_Foundation	Mozilla Foundation	The Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to support and lead the open source Mozilla project. The organization sets the policies that govern development, operates key infrastructure and controls trademarks and other intellectual property. It owns a taxable subsidiary: the Mozilla Corporation, which employs many Mozilla developers and coordinates releases of the Mozilla Firefox web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird email client. The subsidiary is 100% owned by the parent, and therefore follows the same non-profit principles. The Mozilla Foundation was founded by the Netscape-affiliated Mozilla Organization, and was officially launched on July 15, 2003. The organization is currently based in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View, California, USA.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/Mozilla_Foundation_logo.svg/150px-Mozilla_Foundation_logo.svg.png
