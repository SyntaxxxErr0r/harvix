2.00	Storm_(Lenny_Kravitz_song)	(I Can't Make It) Another Day	"(I Can't Make It) Another Day" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson featuring Lenny Kravitz, released onto the posthumous album Michael which as of April 2011 has sold 3 million globally. Initially leaked as a 90-second snippet, it was referred to as "Another Day". Shortly after the leak, singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz confirmed that he had produced and composed "Another Day"; he stated that although he did not leak the song, he would like to have the full version of the song—in which he also features—officially released. Kravitz later referred to the song as "(I Can't Make It) Another Day" on Facebook prior to the release of the Michael album. The song was recorded for the album Invincible, but dropped from the final tracklist. It was later re-written and re-titled "Storm", a collaboration between Kravitz and rapper Jay-Z which is featured on the former's 2004 album Baptism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Michael_Jackson_Cannescropped.jpg/160px-Michael_Jackson_Cannescropped.jpg
