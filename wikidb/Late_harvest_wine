18.01	Late_harvest_wine	Late harvest wine	Late harvest is a term applied to wines made from grapes left on the vine longer than usual. Late harvest is usually an indication of a sweet dessert wine, such as late harvest Riesling. Late harvest grapes are often more similar to raisins, but have been naturally dehydrated while on the vine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Botrytis_riesling.jpg/220px-Botrytis_riesling.jpg
