1.00	Hong_Kong_seam	Seam (sewing)	In sewing, a seam is the join where two or more layers of fabric, leather, or other materials are held together with stitches. Prior to the invention of the sewing machine, all sewing was done by hand. Seams in modern mass-produced household textiles, sporting goods, and ready-to-wear clothing are sewn by computerized machines, while home shoemaking, dressmaking, quilting, crafts, haute couture and tailoring may use a combination of hand and machine sewing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Quilting_seam.jpg/250px-Quilting_seam.jpg
