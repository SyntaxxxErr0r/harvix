2.01	Miami_Manatees_(CFL)	Miami Manatees (CFL)	The Miami Manatees was a proposed Canadian Football League team scheduled to begin play in the 1996 season, and had plans to play out of the Miami Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. After looking at a possible expansion franchise, the decision to relocate the Las Vegas Posse to Miami became the preferred choice to land a CFL team in Miami. The team never came to fruition as the CFL suspended its U.S. operations in spring 1996.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Manatees_CFLUSA.gif/120px-Manatees_CFLUSA.gif
