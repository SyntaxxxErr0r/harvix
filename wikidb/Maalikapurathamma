During this time he mastered all martial arts from various Kalaries. The young daughter, Leela, of Kalari Panicker fall in love with Ayyappa. She requested to accept her as wife. But Ayyappan turned down her request as being a Brahmachari. She was offered a seat at Sabarimala known as Maalikappurathamma. Ayyappan promised her if thereis no Kanni Ayyappans (First time pilgrims with iru-mudi) to come to Sabarimala then he would marry her, but there is no any truth behind this story. It is a custom that every Kanni Ayyappan should deposit Saram (arrow of soft wood) at Saramkuthy as a mark of their arrival.
