138.6	Urban_exploration	Urban exploration	Urban exploration (often shortened as urbex or UE) is the examination of the normally unseen or off-limits parts of urban areas or industrial facilities. Urban exploration is also commonly referred to as infiltration, although some people consider infiltration to be more closely associated with the exploration of active or inhabited sites. It may also be referred to as draining (when exploring drains) urban spelunking, urban rock climbing, urban caving, or building hacking.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Urban_Explorer_Hobart_CA_Edit.jpg/300px-Urban_Explorer_Hobart_CA_Edit.jpg
