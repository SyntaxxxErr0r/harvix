63.1	Giant_impact_hypothesis	Giant impact hypothesis	The giant impact hypothesis states that the Moon was formed out of the debris left over from a collision between the Earth and a Mars-sized body, sometime around 4.5 Ga (four and a half billion years ago). The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, for the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the moon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Giantimpact.gif/270px-Giantimpact.gif
