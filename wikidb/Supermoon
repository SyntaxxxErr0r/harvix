65.5	Supermoon	Supermoon	A "supermoon" is the coincidence of a full moon (or a new moon) with the closest approach the Moon makes to the Earth on its elliptical orbit, or perigee, leading to the technical name for a supermoon of the perigee-syzygy of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. The association of the Moon with both oceanic and crustal tides has led to claims that the supermoon phenomenon may be associated with increased risk of events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. However, the evidence of such a link is widely held to be unconvincing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Supermoon_comparison.jpg/220px-Supermoon_comparison.jpg
