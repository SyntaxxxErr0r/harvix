He was a wise and capable ruler who brought stability and relative prosperity to the Bulgarian Empire after two decades of constant Mongol intervention in the internal issues of the Empire. Theodore Svetoslav's reign began with the return of Southern Bessarabia to Bulgaria and a few years later he managed to defeat the Byzantines and retake most of northern Thrace occupied by them during the crisis. After 1307 he led peaceful policy towards all neighbours which resulted in expanded trade and economy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Silver_coin_of_Theodore_Svetoslav.png/220px-Silver_coin_of_Theodore_Svetoslav.png
