70.4	Protist	Protist	Protists ( ) are a diverse group of eukaryotic microorganisms. Historically, protists were treated as the kingdom Protista, which includes mostly unicellular organisms that do not fit into the other kingdoms, but this group is contested in modern taxonomy. Instead, it is "better regarded as a loose grouping of 30 or 40 disparate phyla with diverse combinations of trophic modes, mechanisms of motility, cell coverings and life cycles."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Protist_collage.jpg/250px-Protist_collage.jpg
