1.11	Hordes_of_Chaos_(album)	Hordes of Chaos (album)	Hordes of Chaos is the twelfth studio album by German thrash metal band Kreator. It has been described as their most organic album to date because, barring vocals, guitar solos and some melodies, the album was recorded in a live setting on analog tape recorder with few overdubs. Frontman Mille Petrozza noted that this was the first time they have recorded an album this way since Pleasure to Kill in 1986.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Kreator-hoc.jpg/220px-Kreator-hoc.jpg
