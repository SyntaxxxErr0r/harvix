2.01	Air_Force_Ballistic_Missile_Division	Air Force Satellite Control Facility	The United States Air Force's Air Force Satellite Control Facility was a space command and control unit located at Onizuka AFB, California. It has the distinction of being heavily involved in the world's first reconnaissance satellite program, CORONA. Due to geological hazards (i.e. earthquakes), and the counterterrorism threat from its proximity to a major transportation link (California Highway 101), the facility's command and control functions were moved to Schriever AFB, Colorado.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Air_Force_Satellite_Control_Facility.PNG/200px-Air_Force_Satellite_Control_Facility.PNG
