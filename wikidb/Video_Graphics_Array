59.7	Video_Graphics_Array	Video Graphics Array	Video Graphics Array refers specifically to the display hardware first introduced with the IBM PS/2 line of computers in 1987, but through its widespread adoption has also come to mean either an analog computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector or the 640Ã—480 resolution itself. While this resolution was superseded in the personal computer market in the 1990s, it is becoming a popular resolution on mobile devices.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Vga-cable.jpg/256px-Vga-cable.jpg
