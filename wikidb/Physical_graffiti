1.00	Physical_graffiti	Physical Graffiti	Physical Graffiti is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 24 February 1975 as a double album. Recording sessions for the album were initially disrupted when bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones considered leaving the band. After reuniting at Headley Grange, the band wrote and recorded eight songs, the combined length of which stretched the album beyond the typical length of an LP. This prompted the band to make Physical Graffiti a double album by including previously unreleased tracks from earlier recording sessions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/LedZeppelinPhysicalGraffitialbumcover.jpg/220px-LedZeppelinPhysicalGraffitialbumcover.jpg
