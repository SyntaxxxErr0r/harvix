23.74	Rosalia_Lombardo	Rosalia Lombardo	Rosalia Lombardo was an Italian child born in 1918 in Palermo, Sicily. She died of pneumonia on December 6, 1920. Rosalia's father, General Lombardo, was sorely grieved upon her death, so he approached Alfredo Salafia, a noted embalmer, to preserve her. Her body was one of the last corpses to be admitted to the Capuchin catacombs of Palermo in Sicily.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Palermo_Rosalia_Lombardo.jpg/220px-Palermo_Rosalia_Lombardo.jpg
