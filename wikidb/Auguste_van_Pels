2.10	Auguste_van_Pels	People associated with Anne Frank	Annelies Marie “Anne” Frank (12 June 1929–early March 1945) was a Jewish girl who, along with her family and four other people, hid in rooms at the back of her father's Amsterdam company during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Helped by several trusted employees of the company, the group of eight survived in the achterhuis (literally "back-house", usually translated as "secret annex") for more than two years before they were betrayed. Anne kept a diary from 12 June 1942 until 1 August 1944, three days before the residents of the annex were betrayed. Anne mentioned several times in her writing that her sister Margot Frank also kept a diary, but no trace of Margot's diary has ever been found.
