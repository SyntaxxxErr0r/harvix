77.8	Washington_Consensus	Washington Consensus	The term Washington Consensus was coined in 1989 by the economist John Williamson to describe a set of ten relatively specific economic policy prescriptions that he considered constituted the "standard" reform package promoted for developing countries by Washington, D.C.-based institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and the US Treasury Department. These economic reforms, popular from the late 1970's to mid 1990's, are generally described as a form of economic liberalism, which seeks to emphasize the efficiency of private enterprise, liberalized trade, and the open of markets. The adoption of these policies was often a precondition to receiving aid from the World Bank and IMF.
