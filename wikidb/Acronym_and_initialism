73.9	Acronym_and_initialism	Acronym and initialism	Acronyms and initialisms are abbreviations formed from the initial components in a phrase or a word. These components may be individual letters (as in CEO) or parts of words (as in Benelux and Ameslan). There is no universal agreement on the precise definition of the various terms (see nomenclature) nor on written usage (see orthographic styling). While popular in recent English, such abbreviations have historical use in English and other languages. As a type of word formation process, acronyms and initialisms are viewed as a subtype of blending.
