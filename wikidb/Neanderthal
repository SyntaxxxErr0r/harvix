147.3	Neanderthal	Neanderthal	The Neanderthal ( , or ; short for Neanderthal man), sometimes spelled Neandertal, is an extinct member of the Homo genus known from Pleistocene specimens found in Europe and parts of western and central Asia. Neanderthals are classified either as a subspecies of Homo sapiens or as a separate human species (Homo neanderthalensis). Genetic evidence suggests interbreeding took place with anatomically modern humans between roughly 80,000 and 50,000 years ago in the Middle East, resulting in 1â€“4% of the genome of people from Eurasia having been contributed by Neanderthals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Homo_sapiens_neanderthalensis.jpg/220px-Homo_sapiens_neanderthalensis.jpg
