2.00	Descolada	Concepts in the Ender's Game series	"The official name is Philotic Parallax Instantaneous Communicator," explains Colonel Graff in Ender's Game, "but somebody dredged the name ansible out of an old book somewhere". The ansible essentially functions as a faster-than-light e-mail system. Graff's description of ansible functions in Xenocide involve a fictional subatomic particle, the philote, and contradicts not only standard physical theory but the results of empirical particle accelerator experiments. In the "Enderverse", the two quarks inside a pi meson can be separated by an arbitrary distance while remaining connected by "philotic rays". This is similar in concept to quantum teleportation due to entanglement. However, in the real world, quark confinement prevents one from separating quarks by more than microscopic distances.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Orson_Scott_Card_at_BYU_Symposium_20080216_closeup.jpg/175px-Orson_Scott_Card_at_BYU_Symposium_20080216_closeup.jpg
