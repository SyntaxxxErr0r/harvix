52.1	Michael_Hutchence	Michael Hutchence	Michael Kelland John Hutchence (22 January 1960 â€“ 22 November 1997) was an Australian musician and actor. He was a founding member and the lead singer and songwriter of rock band INXS from 1977 to his death in 1997. Hutchence was a member of short-lived pop rock group Max Q and recorded solo material which was released posthumously. He acted in feature films, including Dogs in Space (1986) and Frankenstein Unbound (1990). According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, "Hutchence was the archetypal rock showman. He exuded an overtly sexual, macho cool with his flowing locks, and lithe and exuberant stage movements". Hutchence won the 'Best International Artist' at the 1991 BRIT Awards with INXS winning the related group award.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Michael-hutchence-INXS-1986.jpg/220px-Michael-hutchence-INXS-1986.jpg
