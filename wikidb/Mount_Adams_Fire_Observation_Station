The station and contributing resources include a 56-foot-tall (17 m), steel frame lookout tower erected in 1917, a foot trail leading up the 3,250 foot summit, and the 1922 observers cabin with shed and privy. The tower is a prefabricated structure built by the Aermotor Corporation to provide a front line of defense in preserving the Adirondack Park from the hazards of forest fires.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/USA_New_York_location_map.svg/240px-USA_New_York_location_map.svg.png
