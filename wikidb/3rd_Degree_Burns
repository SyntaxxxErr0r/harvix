1.00	3rd_Degree_Burns	Burn	A burn is a type of injury to flesh caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, light, radiation or friction. Most burns affect only the skin . Rarely, deeper tissues, such as muscle, bone, and blood vessels can also be injured. Burns may be treated with first aid, in an out-of-hospital setting, or may require more specialised treatment such as those available at specialised burn centers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/87/Hand2ndburn.jpg/230px-Hand2ndburn.jpg
