1.00	Wordshaker	Wordshaker	Wordshaker is the second studio album by British-Irish girl group The Saturdays, released on 12 October 2009 through Fascination Records. It is the group's first album to feature a song where they are credited as writers. Upon release the album peaked at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, but the following week fell out of the top 30. As of August 2010, the album has been removed from UK iTunes and other digital download outlets, possibly due to Headlines! being released featuring some of the same material.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/TheSaturdaysWordshaker.jpg/220px-TheSaturdaysWordshaker.jpg
