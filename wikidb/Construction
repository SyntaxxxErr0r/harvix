100.1	Construction	Construction	In the fields of architecture and civil engineering, construction is a process that consists of the building or assembling of infrastructure. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking. Normally, the job is managed by a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Sky_scraper_construction.jpg/220px-Sky_scraper_construction.jpg
