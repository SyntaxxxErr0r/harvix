161.2	Identity_theft	Identity theft	Identity theft is a form of stealing someone's identity in which someone pretends to be someone else by assuming that person's identity, typically in order to access resources or obtain credit and other benefits in that person's name. The victim of identity theft (here meaning the person whose identity has been assumed by the identity thief) can suffer adverse consequences if they are held accountable for the perpetrator's actions. Organizations and individuals who are duped or defrauded by the identity thief can also suffer adverse consequences and losses, and to that extent are also victims.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Poster_-_To_Be_or_Not_to_Be_01.jpg/220px-Poster_-_To_Be_or_Not_to_Be_01.jpg
