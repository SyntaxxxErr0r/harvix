62.7	Lead_generation	Lead generation	Lead generation is a marketing term used, often in Internet marketing, to describe the generation of consumer interest or inquiry into products or services of a business. Leads can be generated for a variety of purposes; for example: list building, e-newsletter list acquisition or for winning customers. There are many tactical methods for generating leads. These methods typically fall under the umbrella of advertising, but may also include non-paid sources such as organic search engine results or referrals from existing customers. Businesses strive to generate 'quality' leads. Quality is usually determined by the propensity of the inquirer to take the next action towards a purchase.
