62.6	Antigen	Antigen	An antigen is any substance that causes the immune system to produce antibodies against it. The substance may be from the environment or formed within the body. The immune system will kill or neutralize any antigen that is recognized as a foreign and potentially harmful invader. The term originally came from antibody generator and was a molecule that binds specifically to an antibody, but the term now also refers to any molecule or molecular fragment that can be bound by a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and presented to a T-cell receptor. "Self" antigens are usually tolerated by the immune system; whereas "Non-self" antigens can be identified as invaders and can be attacked by the immune system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Antibody.svg/255px-Antibody.svg.png
