1.00	Wolverton_to_Newport_Pagnell_Line	Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line	The Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line was a railway branch line in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom running from Wolverton on the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) (today's West Coast Main Line) to Newport Pagnell. The line fully opened to passengers in 1867, with an extension to Olney planned in 1865, but this scheme was abandoned after partial construction. Earthworks along the route of the extension still exist in Bury field, and plaques exist detailing the history of the failed project.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Fomer_Bradwell_Halt%2C_July_2009.JPG/250px-Fomer_Bradwell_Halt%2C_July_2009.JPG
