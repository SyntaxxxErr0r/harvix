146.7	King_Arthur	King Arthur	King Arthur is a legendary British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries, who, according to Medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the early 6th century. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians. The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Innsbruck_1_262.jpg/170px-Innsbruck_1_262.jpg
