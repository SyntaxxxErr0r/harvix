59.3	Rope	Rope	A rope is a length of fibres, twisted or braided together to improve strength for pulling and connecting. It has tensile strength but is too flexible to provide compressive strength (i.e. it can be used for pulling, but not pushing). Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, line, string, and twine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Rope.jpg/200px-Rope.jpg
