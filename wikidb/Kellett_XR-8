2.00	Kellett_XR-8	Kellett XR-8	The Kellett XR-8 (later redesignated XH-8) was a helicopter built in the United States during World War II. It was a two-seat machine intended to demonstrate the feasibility of a twin-rotor system, and while it accomplished this, it also demonstrated a number of problems that prevented further development of this particular design.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Kellett_XR-8.JPG/300px-Kellett_XR-8.JPG
