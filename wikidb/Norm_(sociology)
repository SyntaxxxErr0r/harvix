They can also be defined as the shared ways of thinking, feeling, desiring, deciding, and acting which are observable in regularly repeated behaviours and are adopted because they are assumed to solve problems. This sociological and social psychological term has been further defined as "the rules that a group uses for appropriate and inappropriate values, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. They have also been described as the "customary rules of behavior that coordinate our interactions with others." Social norms are rules that define the behaviour that is expected or acceptable in particular circumstances.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/170px-SNA_segment.png
