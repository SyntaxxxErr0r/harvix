394.1	Greenhouse_gas	Greenhouse gas	A greenhouse gas (sometimes abbreviated GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, and Titan also contain gases that cause greenhouse effects. Greenhouse gases greatly affect the temperature of the Earth; without them, Earth's surface would be on average about 33 °C (59 °F)note 1 colder than at present.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/The_green_house_effect.svg/350px-The_green_house_effect.svg.png
