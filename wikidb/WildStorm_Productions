1.00	WildStorm_Productions	WildStorm	WildStorm Productions, or simply WildStorm, (often rendered Wildstorm) published American comic books. Originally an independent company established by Jim Lee and further expanded upon in subsequent years by other creators, WildStorm became a publishing imprint of DC Comics in 1999. Until it was shut down, the WildStorm imprint remained editorially separate from DC Comics, with its main studio located on the West Coast. The imprint took its name from the combining of the titles of the Jim Lee comic series WildC.A.T.S. and Stormwatch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/WildStorm_logo.png
