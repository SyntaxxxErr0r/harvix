2.00	Reunion_(band)	Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)	"Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)" is a 1974 song by an ad hoc group of studio musicians called Reunion, with Joey Levine (bubblegum music pioneer with "Chewy Chewy" and "Yummy Yummy Yummy" to his credit) as the lead singer. The song was written by Paul DiFranco (music) and Norman Dolph (lyrics). The lyrics are a fast patter of '50s, '60s, and '70s disc jockeys, musicians, songwriters, record labels, song titles and lyrics, and (incongruously) Jack the Ripper, broken only by the chorus. Perhaps the earliest recorded rap song, although Tommy Facenda's multi-versioned "High School U.S.A." was fifteen years earlier.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Joey_Levine_Caravan_XV_3684f.jpg/150px-Joey_Levine_Caravan_XV_3684f.jpg
