71.8	Babylonia	Babylonia	Babylonia was an ancient cultural region in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq), with Babylon as its capital. Babylonia emerged as a major power when Hammurabi (1792- 1750 BC or fl. ca. 1696 â€“ 1654 BC, short chronology) created an empire out of the territories of the former Akkadian Empire. Babylonia retained the written Semitic Akkadian language for official use (the language of its native populace), despite its Amorite founders and Kassite successors not being native Akkadians. It retained the Sumerian language for religious use, which by the time Babylon was founded was no longer a spoken language. The Akkadian and Sumerian traditions played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under protracted and lengthy periods of outside rule.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Iraq_2003_occupation.png/150px-Iraq_2003_occupation.png
