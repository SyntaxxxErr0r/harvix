84.8	Femtocell	Femtocell	In telecommunications, a femtocell is a small cellular base station, typically designed for use in a home or small business. It connects to the service providerâ€™s network via broadband (such as DSL or cable); current designs typically support 2 to 4 active mobile phones in a residential setting, and 8 to 16 active mobile phones in enterprise settings. A femtocell allows service providers to extend service coverage indoors, especially where access would otherwise be limited or unavailable. Although much attention is focused on WCDMA, the concept is applicable to all standards, including GSM, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, WiMAX and LTE solutions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/NodeB_HNB.svg/450px-NodeB_HNB.svg.png
