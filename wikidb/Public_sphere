69.9	Public_sphere	Public sphere	The public sphere is an area in social life where individuals can come together to freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political action. It is "a discursive space in which individuals and groups congregate to discuss matters of mutual interest and, where possible, to reach a common judgment." The public sphere can be seen as "a theater in modern societies in which political participation is enacted through the medium of talk" and "a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Kahvihuone.jpg/220px-Kahvihuone.jpg
