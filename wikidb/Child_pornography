52.8	Child_pornography	Child pornography	Child pornography refers to images or films (also known as child abuse images) and, in some cases, writings depicting sexually explicit activities involving a child. Abuse of the child occurs during the sexual acts which are recorded in the production of child pornography, and several professors of psychology state that memories of the abuse are maintained as long as visual records exist, are accessed, and are "exploited perversely."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Operation_Protect_Our_Children_banner.jpg/220px-Operation_Protect_Our_Children_banner.jpg
