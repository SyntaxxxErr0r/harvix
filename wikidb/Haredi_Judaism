60.1	Haredi_Judaism	Haredi Judaism	Haredi , or Charedi/Chareidi Judaism (pl. Haredim) is a term used to describe the most conservative form of Orthodox Judaism, often referred to by outsiders as ultra-Orthodox. Haredi Jews, like other Orthodox Jews, consider their belief system and religious practices to extend in an unbroken chain back to Moses and the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. As a result, they regard non-Orthodox, and to an extent Modern Orthodox, streams of Judaism to be deviations from authentic Judaism. Its historical rejection of Jewish secularism distinguishes it from Western European-derived Modern Orthodox Judaism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Haredi_Judaism.jpg/250px-Haredi_Judaism.jpg
