61.8	Vitamin_B6	Vitamin B6	Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin and is part of the vitamin B complex group. Several forms of the vitamin are known, but pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the active form and is a cofactor in many reactions of amino acid metabolism, including transamination, deamination, and decarboxylation. PLP also is necessary for the enzymatic reaction governing the release of glucose from glycogen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Pyridoxal-phosphate.svg/220px-Pyridoxal-phosphate.svg.png
