A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Sunset_at_Royd_Moor_Wind_Farm.jpg/300px-Sunset_at_Royd_Moor_Wind_Farm.jpg
