1.00	Haileybury_Comets	Haileybury Comets	The Haileybury Hockey Club (also known as the Haileybury Comets) of Haileybury, Ontario, was a professional ice hockey club established in the early 1900s, which is most notable as a member of the National Hockey Association which it played in during the 1910 season. Established to capitalize on the then-current mining boom in northern Ontario, it became clear that the town was too small to support major professional hockey, and the team left the NHA after that season.
