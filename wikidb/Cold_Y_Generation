1.10	Cold_Y_Generation	Generation Y	Generation Y, also known as the Millennial Generation (or Millennials), The Facebook Generation,I re Generation Next, Net Generation, Echo Boomers, describes the demographic cohort following Generation X. There are no precise dates for when the Millennial generation starts and ends, and commentators have used birth dates ranging somewhere from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, early or mid 1990s, or as late as the early 2000s. One segment of this age-group is often called the “eighties babies” generation, in reference to the fact that they were born between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1989. Members of this generation are called Echo Boomers, due to the significant increase in birth rates through the 1980s and into the 1990s, and because many of them are children of baby boomers. The 20th century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued, however, so the relative impact of the "baby boom echo" was generally less pronounced than the original boom.
