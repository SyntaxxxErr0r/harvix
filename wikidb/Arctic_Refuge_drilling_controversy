77.7	Arctic_Refuge_drilling_controversy	Arctic Refuge drilling controversy	The question of whether to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has been an ongoing political controversy in the United States since 1977. The issue has been used by both Democrats and Republicans as a political device, especially through contentious election cycles, and has been the subject of much debate in the National media. ANWR comprises 19,000,000 acres (77,000 km2) of the north Alaskan coast. The land is situated between the Beaufort Sea to the north, Brooks Range to the south, and Prudhoe Bay to the west. It is the largest protected wilderness in the United States and was created by Congress under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980. Section 1002 of that act deferred a decision on the management of oil and gas exploration and development of 1,500,000 acres (6.19 m2) in the coastal plain, known as the "1002 area." The controversy surrounds drilling for oil in this subsection of ANWR.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Anwrmap.jpg/220px-Anwrmap.jpg
