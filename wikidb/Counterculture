72.9	Counterculture	Counterculture	Counterculture (also written counter-culture) is a sociological term used to describe the values and norms of behavior of a cultural group, or subculture, that run counter to those of the social mainstream of the day, the cultural equivalent of political opposition. Counterculture can also be described as a group whose behavior deviates from the societal norm. It is a neologism attributed to Theodore Roszak, author of The Making of a Counter Culture. Although distinct countercultural undercurrents have existed in many societies, here the term refers to a more significant, visible phenomenon that reaches critical mass and persists for a period of time. A countercultural movement expresses the ethos, aspirations, and dreams of a specific population during an eraâ€”a social manifestation of zeitgeist. It is important to distinguish between "counterculture," "subculture," and "fringe culture".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/170px-SNA_segment.png
