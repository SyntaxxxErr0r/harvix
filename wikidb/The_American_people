18.12	The_American_people	Americans	Americans, or American people, are the citizens of the United States. The United States is home to people of different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship. Aside from the Native American population, nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Benjamin_Franklin_by_Joseph_Siffred_Duplessis.jpg/104px-Benjamin_Franklin_by_Joseph_Siffred_Duplessis.jpg
