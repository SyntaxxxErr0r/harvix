57.4	Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum	Index Librorum Prohibitorum	The Index Librorum Prohibitorum (English: ) was a list of publications prohibited by the Catholic Church. A first version (the Pauline Index) was promulgated by Pope Paul IV in 1559, and a revised and somewhat relaxed form (the Tridentine Index) was authorized at the Council of Trent. The promulgation of the Index marked the "turning-point in the freedom of enquiry" in the Catholic world. The final (20th) edition appeared in 1948, and it was formally abolished on 14 June 1966 by Pope Paul VI.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum_1.jpg/220px-Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum_1.jpg
