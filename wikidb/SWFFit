The library can also detect the installed Adobe Flash Player plug-in in all major web browsers, on all major operating systems (OS), and can redirect the visitor to another webpage or show alternate HTML content if the installed plug-in is not suitable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3e/Swfobject_logo.gif/200px-Swfobject_logo.gif
