The Olympic Games have come to be regarded as the worldâ€™s foremost sports competition where more than 200 nations participate. The Games are currently held every two years, with Summer and Winter Olympic Games alternating, although they occur every four years within their respective seasonal games. Originally, the ancient Olympic Games were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC has since become the governing body of the Olympic Movement, whose structure and actions are defined by the Olympic Charter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b1/Olympic_Rings.svg/300px-Olympic_Rings.svg.png
