94.7	Newcastle_upon_Tyne	Newcastle upon Tyne	Newcastle upon Tyne (locally ; often shortened to Newcastle) is a city and metropolitan borough of Tyne and Wear, in North East England. Historically a part of Northumberland, it is situated on the north bank of the River Tyne. The city developed in the area that was the location of the Roman settlement called Pons Aelius, though it owes its name to the castle built in 1080, by Robert II, Duke of Normandy, the eldest son of William the Conqueror. The city grew as an important centre for the wool trade and it later became a major coal mining area. The port developed in the 16th century and, along with the shipyards lower down the river, was amongst the world's largest shipbuilding and ship-repairing centres. These industries have since experienced severe decline and closure, and the city today is largely a business and cultural centre, with a particular reputation for nightlife.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Bridges_opening_up_-_geograph.org.uk_-_178375.jpg/280px-Bridges_opening_up_-_geograph.org.uk_-_178375.jpg
