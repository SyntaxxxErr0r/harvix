92.7	Nonogram	Nonogram	Nonograms, also known as Hanjie, Paint by Numbers, or Griddlers, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid have to be colored or left blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers measure how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Paint_by_numbers_Animation.gif/250px-Paint_by_numbers_Animation.gif
