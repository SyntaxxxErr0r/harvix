75.0	Wave_power	Wave power	Wave power is the transport of energy by ocean surface waves, and the capture of that energy to do useful work â€” for example, electricity generation, water desalination, or the pumping of water (into reservoirs). Machinery able to exploit wave power is generally known as a wave energy converter (WEC).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Elliptical_trajectory_on_ripples.svg/300px-Elliptical_trajectory_on_ripples.svg.png
