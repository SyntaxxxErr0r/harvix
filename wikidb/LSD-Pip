2.21	LSD-Pip	LSD-Pip	LSD-Pip is a compound from the ergoline family, related to LSD but with the N,N-diethyl substitution replaced by a piperidine group. It is more potent than the corresponding pyrrolidine and morpholine analogues (LPD-824 and LSM-775 respectively), but is still several times less potent than LSD as a 5-HT2A agonist. Early studies suggested this compound to be inactive as a hallucinogen in humans, though this does not seem to have been confirmed by any more recent work.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/LSD-Pip.svg/200px-LSD-Pip.svg.png
