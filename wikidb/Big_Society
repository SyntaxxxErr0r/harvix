83.6	Big_Society	Big Society	The Big Society was the flagship policy idea of the 2010 UK Conservative Party general election manifesto. It now forms part of the legislative programme of the Conservative â€“ Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement. The aim is "to create a climate that empowers local people and communities, building a big society that will 'take power away from politicians and give it to people'. While some have responded to the policy favourably, its aims have been queried and disputed by other commentators.
