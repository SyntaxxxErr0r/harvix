85.0	Ike_Turner	Ike Turner	Isaac (Ike) Wister Turner (November 5, 1931 â€“ December 12, 2007) was an American musician, bandleader, songwriter, arranger, talent scout, and record producer. In a career that lasted more than half a century, his repertoire included blues, soul, rock, and funk. He is most popularly known for his 1960s work with his then wife Tina Turner in the Ike &amp; Tina Turner revue. Growing up in Clarksdale, Mississippi, he began playing piano and guitar when he was eight, forming his group, the Kings of Rhythm as a teenager at high school. He employed the group as his backing band for the rest of his life. His first recording, "Rocket 88" with the Kings of Rhythm credited as "Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats", in 1951, is considered a possible contender for "first rock and roll song". Relocating to St. Louis, Missouri in 1954, he built the Kings into one of the most renowned acts on the local club circuit. It was there he met singer Anna Mae Bullock, whom he married and renamed Tina Turner, forming the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue, which over the course of the sixties became a soul/rock crossover success.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Iketurner1997.jpg/220px-Iketurner1997.jpg
