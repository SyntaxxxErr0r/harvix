15.72	Valle_dei_Templi	Valle dei Templi	The Valle dei Templi (English: Valley of the Temples, Sicilian: Vaddi di li Tempri) is an archaeological site in Agrigento (ancient Greek Akragas), Sicily, southern Italy. It is one of the most outstanding examples of Greater Greece art and architecture, and is one of the main attractions of Sicily as well as a national monument of Italy. The area was included in the UNESCO Heritage Site list in 1997. Much of the excavation and restoration of the temples was due to the efforts of archaeologist Domenico Antonio Lo Faso Pietrasanta (1783â€“1863), who was the Duke of Serradifalco from 1809 through 1812.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Agrigento-Tempio_della_Concordia01.JPG/230px-Agrigento-Tempio_della_Concordia01.JPG
