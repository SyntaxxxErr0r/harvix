2.00	Loverboy_(band)	Loverboy	Loverboy is a Canadian rock group formed in 1980 in Calgary, Alberta. Throughout the 1980s, the band accumulated numerous hit songs in Canada and the United States, earning four multi-platinum albums and selling millions of records. After being rejected by many American record labels they signed with Columbia/CBS Records Canada and began recording their first album March 20, 1980, with Mike Reno on lead vocals, Paul Dean on guitars, Scott Smith on bass guitar, Doug Johnson on keyboards, and Matt Frenette on drums. The band's hit singles, particularly "Turn Me Loose" and "Working for the Weekend", have become arena rock staples and are still heard on many classic rock radio stations across the United States and Canada. They are currently based in Vancouver, British Columbia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Loverboy_at_Juno_Awards_2009.jpg/250px-Loverboy_at_Juno_Awards_2009.jpg
