2.00	Sultans_(John_Reis_band)	Sultans (band)	The Sultans were an American rock and roll band led by John Reis, formed in 2000 in San Diego, California and disbanded in January 2007. Over the course of the band's lifespan they released two full-length albums on Reis' Swami Records label. The band took pride in their "stripped down" rock and roll approach, using a simple guitar/bass/drum structure and recording quickly using pre-used equipment and borrowed instruments in order to maintain a loose, spontaneous feel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/John_Reis_live_with_Sultans_1-10-07.jpg/220px-John_Reis_live_with_Sultans_1-10-07.jpg
