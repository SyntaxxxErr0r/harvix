117.5	Geology	Geology	Geology (from the Greek γῆ, gê, "earth" and λόγος, logos, "study") is the science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which it evolves. Geology gives insight into the history of the Earth, as it provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and past climates. In modern times, geology is commercially important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and for evaluating water resources; is publicly important for the prediction and understanding of natural hazards, the remediation of environmental problems, and for providing insights into past climate change; plays a role in geotechnical engineering; and is a major academic discipline. Geology is also a hobby for those who enjoy collecting various rocks, minerals and/or fossils.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/WasatchFault.JPG/300px-WasatchFault.JPG
