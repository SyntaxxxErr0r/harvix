3.11	St_Bartholomew's_Church,_Li%C3%A8ge	St Bartholomew's Church, Liège	Founded outside the city walls, the Roman Catholic Collegial Church of Saint Bartholemew in Liège, Belgium, was built in coal sandstone, from the late 11th century (the chancel) to the late 12th century (the massive westwork, with its twin towers which were reconstructed in 1876), and underwent, like most religious buildings, modifications through the centuries. Nevertheless, the Meuse Romanesque—Ottonian architecture character of its architecture remained deeply rooted. The 18th century saw the addition of two more aisles, the opening of a neoclassical portal in the walls of the westwork, and the French Baroque redecoration of the interior. The interior of the western section has recently been restored back to the original style.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Eglise-liege-stbarthelemy-janvier2006.jpg/250px-Eglise-liege-stbarthelemy-janvier2006.jpg
