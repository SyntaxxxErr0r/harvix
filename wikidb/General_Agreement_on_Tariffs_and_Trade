51.0	General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade	General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade	The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (typically abbreviated GATT) was negotiated during the UN Conference on Trade and Employment and was the outcome of the failure of negotiating governments to create the International Trade Organization (ITO). GATT was signed in 1946 and lasted until 1993, when it was replaced by the World Trade Organization in 1995. The original GATT text (GATT 1946) is still in effect under the WTO framework, subject to the modifications of GATT 1994.
