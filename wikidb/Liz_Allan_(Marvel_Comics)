1.00	Liz_Allan_(Marvel_Comics)	Liz Allan	Elizabeth Allan - Osborn, who usually goes by the name Liz Allan (commonly misspelled, even in the published comics themselves, as Liz Allen), is a fictional character that appears in the comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. In the character's earliest appearances, she was an attractive, popular girl at the high school of the nerdy Peter Parker, who is secretly Spider-Man. She was an early love interest of Peter but differences in their levels of social acceptance kept them apart. Since then, she has been seen semi-frequently in various Spider-Man series and has ties to his adversaries the Green Goblin and Molten Man.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Liz_Allan.jpg/175px-Liz_Allan.jpg
