81.7	Vacuum	Vacuum	Vacuum is space that is empty of matter. The word stems from the Latin adjective vacuus for "empty". An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call "vacuum" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. The Latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Kolbenluftpumpe_hg.jpg/220px-Kolbenluftpumpe_hg.jpg
