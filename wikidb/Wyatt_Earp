70.7	Wyatt_Earp	Wyatt Earp	Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848 â€“ January 13, 1929) was an American investor and law enforcement officer who served in several Western frontier towns. He was also at different times a farmer, teamster, bouncer, saloon-keeper, miner and boxing referee. He is most well known for his part in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral during which three outlaw Cowboys were killed. The 30-second gunfight defined the rest of his life. Earp's modern-day reputation is that of the Old West's "toughest and deadliest gunman of his day."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Wyatt_Earp_portrait.png/210px-Wyatt_Earp_portrait.png
