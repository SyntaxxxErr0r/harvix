73.2	Asexual_reproduction	Asexual reproduction	Asexual reproduction is a mode of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single parent, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it is reproduction which does not involve meiosis, ploidy reduction, or fertilization. A more stringent definition is agamogenesis which is reproduction without the fusion of gametes. Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for single-celled organisms such as the archaea, bacteria, and protists. Many plants and fungi reproduce asexually as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Caduco.jpg/400px-Caduco.jpg
