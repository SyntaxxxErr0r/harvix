27.02	Ron_Wyatt	Ron Wyatt	Ronald Eldon Wyatt (1933 – August 4, 1999) was an adventurer and former nurse anaesthetist noted for advocating the Durupınar site as the site of Noah's Ark, among other Bible-related pseudoarchaeology. His claims were dismissed by scientists, historians, biblical scholars, and even by leaders in his own Seventh-day Adventist Church, but his work continues to have a following among some fundamentalists and evangelicals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Ron_wyatt_with_noahs_ark_in_turkey.jpg/220px-Ron_wyatt_with_noahs_ark_in_turkey.jpg
