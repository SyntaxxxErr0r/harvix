115.1	Chuck_Norris	Chuck Norris	Carlos Ray "Chuck" Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist and actor. After serving in the United States Air Force, he began his rise to fame as a martial artist and has since founded his own school, Chun Kuk Do. As a result of his "tough guy" image, an Internet phenomenon began in 2005 known as Chuck Norris facts, ascribing various implausible or even impossible feats to Norris.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/ChuckNorris200611292256.jpg/220px-ChuckNorris200611292256.jpg
