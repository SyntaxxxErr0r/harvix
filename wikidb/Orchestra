94.1	Orchestra	Orchestra	An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble that contains sections of string, brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments. The term orchestra derives from the Greek ορχήστρα, the name for the area in front of an ancient Greek stage reserved for the Greek chorus. The orchestra grew by accretion throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, but changed very little in composition during the course of the 20th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Orquesta_Filarmonica_de_Jalisco.jpg/280px-Orquesta_Filarmonica_de_Jalisco.jpg
