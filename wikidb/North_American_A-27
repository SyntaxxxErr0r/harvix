1.00	North_American_A-27	North American A-27	The North American Aviation A-27 was an attack version of the North American BC-1. Ten aircraft were ordered by Thailand as NA-69 light attack aircraft. Instead of being delivered to Thailand, the aircraft were taken over on October 1940 by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) to keep them out of Japanese hands and redesignated A-27 under the USAAC's aircraft designation system. Assigned to Nichols Field in the Philippines, all A-27s were destroyed within days of Japan's invasion of that country during World War II. Aircraft s/n: 41-18890 / 41-18899 (c/n: 69-3064 / 69-3073).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/NicholsField.jpg/300px-NicholsField.jpg
