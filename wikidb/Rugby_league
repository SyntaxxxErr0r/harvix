73.1	Rugby_league	Rugby league	Rugby league football, usually called rugby league, is a full contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular grass field. One of the two codes of rugby football, it originated in England in 1895 as a split from the Rugby Football Union over the issue of payments to players. Its rules gradually changed to produce a more entertaining game for spectators. It is frequently cited as the toughest, most physically demanding of team sports.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Lance_hohaia_running_into_the_defence_%28rugby_league%29.jpg/270px-Lance_hohaia_running_into_the_defence_%28rugby_league%29.jpg
