72.0	Space_debris	Space debris	Space debris, also known as orbital debris, space junk, and space waste, is the collection of objects in orbit around Earth that were created by humans but no longer serve any useful purpose. These objects consist of everything from spent rocket stages and defunct satellites to erosion, explosion and collision fragments. As the orbits of these objects often overlap the trajectories of newer objects, debris is a potential collision risk to operational spacecraft.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Debris-GEO1280.jpg/220px-Debris-GEO1280.jpg
