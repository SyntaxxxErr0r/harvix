1.10	The_Sylvester_%26_Tweety_Mysteries	The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries	The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries, produced by Warner Bros. Animation, is an animated television series which aired from 1995 to 2001 on Kids' WB and was later re-run on Cartoon Network. It follows Looney Tunes characters Sylvester and Tweety Bird, and their owner Granny, along with bulldog Hector (who appeared in several cartoons alongside Tweety, Sylvester and Granny but was in the series given a new design similar to that of Marc Antony), as they solved mysteries, even with Sylvester still trying to eat Tweety in the middle of solving the mysteries, but Hector acted as a bodyguard for Tweety, and would even beat Sylvester up (usually out of shot, but sometimes behind a blind). The first season was dedicated to the memory of Friz Freleng, who had died only months before the series premiere. Also, it contains one case per episode, in contrast to the other seasons, which are all with two cases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/The_Sylvester_and_Tweety_Mysteries.jpg/220px-The_Sylvester_and_Tweety_Mysteries.jpg
