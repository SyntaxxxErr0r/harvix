57.1	Dymaxion_map	Dymaxion map	The Dymaxion map or Fuller map is a projection of a world map onto the surface of a polyhedron, which can be unfolded and flattened to two dimensions. The projection depicts the earth's continents as "one island," or nearly contiguous land masses. The arrangement heavily interrupts the map in order to preserve shapes and sizes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Fuller_projection_rotated.svg/240px-Fuller_projection_rotated.svg.png
