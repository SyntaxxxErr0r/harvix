132.6	Arnold_Schoenberg	Arnold Schoenberg	Arnold Schoenberg was an Austrian composer, associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School. He used the spelling Sch√∂nberg until after his move to the United States in 1934 (Steinberg 1995, 463), whereupon he altered it to Schoenberg "in deference to American practice" (Foss 1951, 401), though one writer claims he made the change a year earlier (Ross 2007, 45).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Arnold_Schoenberg_la_1948.jpg/250px-Arnold_Schoenberg_la_1948.jpg
