The series is set in the present day, beginning as the world is struck by a deadly pandemic that turns humans into zombies. The story follows Takashi Komuro, a Japanese student at Fujimi High School who survived the initial outbreak along with several of his classmates and the school nurse, and occasionally jumps to the perspective of other characters. As the cast tries to survive the zombie apocalypse, they must also face the additional threats of societal collapse, in the form of dangerous fellow survivors, and the possible decay of their own moral codes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/HOTD_vol.1_DVD_cover.jpg/200px-HOTD_vol.1_DVD_cover.jpg
