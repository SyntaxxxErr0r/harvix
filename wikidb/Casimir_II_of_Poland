In 1186 Casimir also inherited the Duchy of Masovia from his nephew Leszek, becoming the progenitor of the Masovian branch of the royal Piast dynasty, great-grandfather of the later Polish king Władysław I the Elbow-high. The honorific title "the Just" wasn't contemporary; it only appeared in the 16th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Polska_1177-1194.PNG/260px-Polska_1177-1194.PNG
