3.20	Takeaway	Take-out	Take-out or takeout (in North American, Philippine English), carry-out (in U.S., Scottish English), take-away (in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Hong Kong and Ireland), parcel (in Indian English and Pakistani English), or tapau (in Manglish and Singlish—from the Chinese "package it" 打包 da-bao), is food purchased at a restaurant for the purpose of being eaten elsewhere. The restaurant may or may not provide table service. In the United States and Canada, food ordered this way (especially in fast food) is ordered to go, and in the UK it is ordered to take away or sometimes to eat out, as opposed to eating in or dining in.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/Take_out_collage.jpg/260px-Take_out_collage.jpg
