10.10	Heck_Cattle	Heck cattle	Heck Cattle are a hardy breed of domestic cattle. They are the result of an attempt to breed back the aurochs, which became extinct in 1627, from modern aurochs-derived cattle. Controversy as to success of the program and techniques used specifically revolve around genetics, behavior, biology. It must be kept in mind that there are considerable differences between the domestic cattle breed of the Heck brothers and the aurochs and that there are other cattle breeds which resemble their wild ancestor at least as much as heck cattle or more.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Heck_cattle_male.jpg/280px-Heck_cattle_male.jpg
