3.00	Treasure_of_Nagyszentmikl%C3%B3s	Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós	The Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós or Treasure of Sânnicolau Mare is an important hoard of twenty-three early medieval gold vessels, in total weighing 9.945 kg, found in 1799 near the town then known as Nagy Szent Miklos or Groß-Sankt-Niklaus (Romanian: Sânnicolau Mare) in northern Banat (then part of the Torontal County within the Kingdom of Hungary in the Habsburg Empire, today in Timiş County in western Romania, near the border with Hungary). After the excavation, the treasure was transferred to Vienna, the capital of the empire. Ever since it has been in a possession of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, where it is on permanent display. A wide range of views continue to be held as to the dating and the origins of the styles of the pieces, and the context in which they were made, which may well vary between the pieces. Unusually, the inscriptions on some pieces have if anything increased the complexity of the arguments rather than reduced them. Recently, Romania have issued requests to the Austrian government for its repatriation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Tezaurul_Sannicolau_Mare_3.jpg/220px-Tezaurul_Sannicolau_Mare_3.jpg
