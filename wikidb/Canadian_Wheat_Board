18.82	Canadian_Wheat_Board	Canadian Wheat Board	The Canadian Wheat Board (French: ) was established by the Parliament of Canada on 5 July 1935 as a mandatory producer marketing system for wheat and barley in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and a small part of British Columbia. Although it is often called a monopoly, it is actually instead a monopsony since it is the only buyer of wheat and barley.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/433_Main_Street_and_Canadian_Wheat_Board_Building%2C_Winnipeg.jpg/200px-433_Main_Street_and_Canadian_Wheat_Board_Building%2C_Winnipeg.jpg
