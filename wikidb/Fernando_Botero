87.6	Fernando_Botero	Fernando Botero	Fernando Botero Angulo (born April 19, 1932) is a Colombian figurative artist. His works feature a figurative style, called by some "Boterismo", which gives them an unmistakable identity. Botero depicts women, men, daily life, historical events and characters, milestones of art, still-life, animals and the natural world in general, with exaggerated and disproportionate volumetry, accompanied by fine details of scathing criticism, irony, humor, and ingenuity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Fernando_Botero.jpg/170px-Fernando_Botero.jpg
