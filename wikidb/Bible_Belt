62.3	Bible_Belt	Bible Belt	Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the southeastern and south-central United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. The Bible Belt consists of much of the Southern United States extending west into Texas and Oklahoma. During the colonial period (1607â€“1776), the South was a stronghold of the Anglican church. Its transition to a stronghold of non-Anglican Protestantism occurred gradually over the next century as a series of religious revival movements, many associated with the Baptist denomination, gained great popularity in the region.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/BibleBelt.png/256px-BibleBelt.png
