67.0	Dongle	Software protection dongle	A software protection dongle is a small piece of hardware that plugs into an electrical connector on a computer and serves as an electronic "key" for a piece of software; the program will run only when the dongle is plugged in. The term "dongle" was originally used to refer only to software-protection dongles; however, currently "dongle" is often used to refer to any small piece of hardware that plugs into a computer. This article is limited in scope to dongles used for the purpose of copy protection or authentication of software to be used on that system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/58/UnikeyTime.PNG/220px-UnikeyTime.PNG
