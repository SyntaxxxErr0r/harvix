88.8	Spice	Spice	A spice is a dried seed, fruit, root, bark, or vegetative substance used in nutritionally insignificant quantities as a food additive for flavor, color, or as a preservative that kills harmful bacteria or prevents their growth. It may be used to flavour a dish or to hide other flavours. In the kitchen, spices are distinguished from herbs, which are leafy, green plant parts used for flavoring or as garnish.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/409841087_b7bcac1bd5_o.jpg/250px-409841087_b7bcac1bd5_o.jpg
