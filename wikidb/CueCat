94.1	CueCat	CueCat	The CueCat is a cat-shaped handheld barcode reader that was released in 1999 by the now defunct Digital Convergence Corporation. The CueCat enabled a user to open a link to an Internet URL by scanning a barcode — called a "cue" by Digital Convergence — appearing in an article or catalog or on some other printed matter. In this way, a user could be directed to a web page containing related information without having to enter a URL. The company asserted that the ability of the device to direct users to a specific URL, rather than a domain name, was valuable. In addition, TV broadcasters could use an audio tone in programs and/or commercials that, when attached to a computer (via an audio cable), acted as a web address shortcut. The system is no longer in operation, although more than 117 scan commerce and scan to connect patents developed by the company during its inception have been licensed to 103 consumer and commercial equipment manufacturers, services and enterprises.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Cuecat2.jpg/220px-Cuecat2.jpg
