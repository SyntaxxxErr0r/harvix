3.00	Ethiopian_Army	Ethiopian National Defense Force	The Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) is the military of Ethiopia. Civil direction of the military is carried out through the Ministry of Defense, which oversees the ground forces, air force, as well as the Defense Industry Sector. The current defense minister is Siraj Fergessa. Size of the ENDF has fluctuated significantly since the end of Ethiopia-Eritrea war in 2000. In 2002 the Ethiopian Defense Forces had strength of approximately 400.000 troops. This was roughly the same number maintained during the Derg regime that fell to the rebel forces in 1991. However, that number was later reduced, and in January 2007, during the War in Somalia, Ethiopian forces were said to comprise about 300,000 troops.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Flag_of_Ethiopia.svg/250px-Flag_of_Ethiopia.svg.png
