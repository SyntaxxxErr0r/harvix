168.1	Mark_Granovetter	Mark Granovetter	Granovetter's paper "The Strength of Weak Ties" is a highly influential sociology paper, with over 19,000 citations according to Google Scholar (by December 2011). In marketing, information science, or politics, weak ties enable reaching populations and audiences that are not accessible via strong ties. The concepts and findings of this work were later published in the monograph Getting A Job, an adaptation of Granovetter's doctoral dissertation at Harvard University's Department of Social Relations, with the title: "Changing Jobs: Channels of Mobility Information in a Suburban Population" (313 pages).
