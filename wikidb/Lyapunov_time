1.61	Lyapunov_time	Lyapunov time	In mathematics, the Lyapunov time is the length of time for a dynamical system to become chaotic. The Lyapunov time reflects the limits of the predictability of the system. By convention, it is defined as the time for the distance between nearby trajectories of the system to increase by a factor of e.
