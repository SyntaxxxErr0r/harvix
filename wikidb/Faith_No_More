81.0	Faith_No_More	Faith No More	Faith No More is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, hailed as one of the most influential metal/rock bands of the late 80s and early 90s, and credited for inventing alternative metal and as an influence on nu metal. It was formed originally as Faith No Man in 1981 by bassist Billy Gould, keyboardist Wade Worthington, vocalist Michael Morris and drummer Mike Bordin. A year later when Worthington was replaced by keyboardist Roddy Bottum, and Mike Morris was ousted, the group began calling themselves Faith No More. After going through a series of singers which included Courtney Love, the band was joined by Chuck Mosley in 1983. The same year, Jim Martin was recruited to replace guitarist Mark Bowen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Faith_No_More_2009.jpg/250px-Faith_No_More_2009.jpg
