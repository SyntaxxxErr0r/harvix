It was adopted in August 1949, and defines humanitarian protections for civilians in a war zone, and outlaws the practice of total war. There are currently 194 countries party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, including this fourth treaty but also including the other three.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Warsaw_1939_refugees_and_soldier.jpg/220px-Warsaw_1939_refugees_and_soldier.jpg
