It is a standard means of measuring well-being, especially child welfare. It is used to distinguish whether the country is a developed, a developing or an under-developed country, and also to measure the impact of economic policies on quality of life. There are also HDI for states, cities, villages, etc. by local organizations or companies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/2011_UN_Human_Development_Report_Quartiles.svg/400px-2011_UN_Human_Development_Report_Quartiles.svg.png
