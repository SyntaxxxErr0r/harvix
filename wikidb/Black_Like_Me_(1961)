2.00	Black_Like_Me_(1961)	Black Like Me	Black Like Me is a nonfiction book by journalist John Howard Griffin first published in 1961. Griffin was a white native of Mansfield, Texas and the book describes his six-week experience travelling on Greyhound buses (occasionally hitchhiking) throughout the racially segregated states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia passing as a black man. Sepia Magazine financed the project in exchange for the right to print the account first as a series of articles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/Black_Like_Me.jpg/200px-Black_Like_Me.jpg
