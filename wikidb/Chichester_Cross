4.21	Chichester_Cross	Chichester Cross	Chichester Cross stands in the centre of the city of Chichester, England at the intersection of the four principal streets. According to the inscription upon it, this cross was built by Edward Story, the bishop of Chichester from 1477 to 1503; but little is known for certain and the style and ornaments of the building suggest that it may be referred to the time of Edward IV. It was built so that the poor people should have somewhere to sell their wares. An earlier wooden cross had been erected on the same site by Bishop Rede (1369-1385). The stone cross was repaired during the reign of Charles II, and at the expense of the Duke of Richmond, in 1746 and stands to this day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Chichester_Cross%2C_c.1831.png/250px-Chichester_Cross%2C_c.1831.png
