76.4	The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare	The Tortoise and the Hare	The Tortoise and the Hare (also known as The Hare and the Tortoise) is a fable attributed to Aesop and is number 226 in the Perry Index. The story concerns a hare who ridicules a slow-moving tortoise and is challenged by him to a race. The hare soon leaves the tortoise behind and, confident of winning, decides to take a nap midway through the course. When he awakes, however, he finds that his competitor, crawling slowly but steadily, has arrived before him. The meaning is morally problematic and the story has been interpreted in a variety of ways over the centuries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Tortoise_and_hare_rackham.jpg/300px-Tortoise_and_hare_rackham.jpg
