Earlier editions were called Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical, but the book's name is commonly shortened to, and later editions are titled, Gray's Anatomy. The book is widely regarded as an extremely influential work on the subject, and has continued to be revised and republished from its initial publication in 1858 to the present day. The 40th (and 150th-year anniversary) edition of the book was published in 2008.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Gray219.png/170px-Gray219.png
