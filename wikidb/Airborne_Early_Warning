12.02	Airborne_Early_Warning	Airborne early warning and control	An airborne early warning and control (or more commonly and historically an AWAC) system is an airborne radar system designed to detect aircraft at long ranges and control and command the battle space in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack plane strikes. AEW&amp;C/AWAC units are also used to carry out surveillance, including over ground targets and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, battle management) functions similar to an Airport Traffic Controller given military command over other forces. Used at a high altitude, the radars on the aircraft allow the operators to distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft hundreds of miles away.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Usaf.e3sentry.750pix.jpg/220px-Usaf.e3sentry.750pix.jpg
