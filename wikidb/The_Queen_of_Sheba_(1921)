1.00	The_Queen_of_Sheba_(1921)	The Queen of Sheba (film)	The Queen of Sheba is a silent film produced by Fox studios about the story of the ill-fated romance between Solomon, King of Israel, and the Queen of Sheba. Written and directed by J. Gordon Edwards, it starred Betty Blythe as Sheba and Fritz Leiber as King Solomon. The film is well known amongst silent film buffs for the risqu√© costumes displayed by lead actress Betty Blythe as evidenced by several surviving stills taken during the production. This was a rarity in mainstream Hollywood films at the time. As no print of the film survives, a final judgment of this production will most likely never be known.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Sheba-Arabian-queen.jpg/220px-Sheba-Arabian-queen.jpg
