65.9	Quantum_dot	Quantum dot	A quantum dot is a portion of matter (e.g., semiconductor) whose excitons are confined in all three spatial dimensions. Consequently, such materials have electronic properties intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and those of discrete molecules. They were discovered at the beginning of the 1980s by Alexei Ekimov in a glass matrix and by Louis E. Brus in colloidal solutions. The term "quantum dot" was coined by Mark Reed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/QD_S.jpg/165px-QD_S.jpg
