26.33	Ural_mountains	Ural Mountains	The Ural Mountains , or simply the Urals, are a mountain range that runs approximately from north to south through western Russia, from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Ural River and northwestern Kazakhstan. Their eastern side is usually considered the natural boundary between Europe and Asia. Vaygach Island and the islands of Novaya Zemlya form a further continuation of the chain to the north into the Arctic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Russland_topo.png/256px-Russland_topo.png
