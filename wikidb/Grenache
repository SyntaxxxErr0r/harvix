62.9	Grenache	Grenache	Grenache (Spanish: , IPA: ; Catalan: , IPA: or ) is one of the most widely planted red wine grape varieties in the world. It ripens late, so it needs hot, dry conditions such as those found in Spain, the south of France, and California's San Joaquin Valley. It is generally spicy, berry-flavored and soft on the palate with a relatively high alcohol content, but it needs careful control of yields for best results. It tends to lack acid, tannin and color, and is usually blended with other varieties such as Syrah, Carignan, Tempranillo and Cinsaut.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Grenache_noir_grapes.jpg/215px-Grenache_noir_grapes.jpg
