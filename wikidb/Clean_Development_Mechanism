78.1	Clean_Development_Mechanism	Clean Development Mechanism	The amount of emission reduction depends on the emissions that would have occurred without the project minus the emissions of the project. The construction of such a hypothetical scenario is known as the baseline of the project. The baseline may be estimated through reference to emissions from similar activities and technologies in the same country or other countries, or to actual emissions prior to project implementation. The partners involved in the project could have an interest in establishing a baseline with high emissions, which would yield a risk of awarding spurious credits. Independent third party verification is meant to avoid this potential problem.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/CDM_CER.png/150px-CDM_CER.png
