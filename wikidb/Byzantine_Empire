121.3	Byzantine_Empire	Byzantine Empire	The Byzantine Empire (the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantium) was the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, centered on the capital of Constantinople. Known simply as the "Roman Empire" or Romania () to its inhabitants and neighbours, it was the direct continuation of the Ancient Roman State and maintained Roman state traditions. Byzantium is today distinguished from ancient Rome insofar as it was oriented towards the Balkans and Anatolia, rather than the Italian Peninsula, and characterised by Christianity rather than Roman polytheism, and was predominantly Greek-speaking rather than Latin-speaking.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Justinian550AD.png/250px-Justinian550AD.png
