1.01	Turning_movement	Turning movement	In military tactics, a turning movement involves an attacker's forces reaching the rear of a defender's forces, separating the defender from their principal defensive positions and placing them in a pocket. The defender must then abandon these positions, or send considerable forces to attempt to recapture them.
