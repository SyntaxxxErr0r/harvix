8.00	Erastianism	Thomas Erastus	Thomas Erastus (September 7, 1524 â€“ December 31, 1583) was a Swiss physician and theologian best known for a posthumously published work in which he argued that the sins of Christians should be punished by the state, and not by the church withholding the sacraments. A generalization of this idea, that the state is supreme in church matters, is known somewhat misleadingly as Erastianism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Thomas_Erastus.jpg/200px-Thomas_Erastus.jpg
