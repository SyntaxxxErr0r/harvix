111.3	Grover_Cleveland	Grover Cleveland	Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States. Cleveland is the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms (1885–1889 and 1893–1897) and therefore is the only individual to be counted twice in the numbering of the presidents. He was the winner of the popular vote for president three times—in 1884, 1888, and 1892—and was the only Democrat elected to the presidency in the era of Republican political domination that lasted from 1861 to 1913.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/StephenGroverCleveland.png/220px-StephenGroverCleveland.png
