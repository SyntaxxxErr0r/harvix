12.21	FTP_server	File Transfer Protocol	File Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. It is often used to upload web pages and other documents from a private development machine to a public web-hosting server. FTP is built on a client-server architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves using a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that hides (encrypts) your username and password, as well as encrypts the content, you can try using a client that uses SSH File Transfer Protocol.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Passive_FTP_Verbindung.svg/220px-Passive_FTP_Verbindung.svg.png
