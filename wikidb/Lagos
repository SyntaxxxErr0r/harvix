65.4	Lagos	Lagos	Lagos (English pronunciation: -gos; is a port city and the most populous city in Nigeria. With a population of 7,937,932, it is also the most populous city in Africa and is estimated to be the second fastest growing city in Africa (7th fastest in the world). Lagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people. Under the leadership of their Olofin, the Awori moved to an island now called Iddo and then to the larger Lagos Island. In the 15th century the Awori settlement was attacked by the Benin Empire following a quarrel, and the island became a Benin war-camp called "Eko" under Oba Orhogba, the Oba of Benin at the time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Lagos%2C_Nigeria_57991.jpg/250px-Lagos%2C_Nigeria_57991.jpg
