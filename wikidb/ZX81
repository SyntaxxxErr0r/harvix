60.0	ZX81	ZX81	The ZX81 was a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was eventually discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market â€“ the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in a number of countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Sinclair-ZX81.png/250px-Sinclair-ZX81.png
