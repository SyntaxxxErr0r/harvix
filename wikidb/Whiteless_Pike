3.40	Whiteless_Pike	Whiteless Pike	Whiteless Pike (660 metres high/2,165ft) is a fell in the north-western English Lake District. It stands immediately east of Crummock Water and forms a perfect pyramid shape when viewed from Rannerdale. In his celebrated guide to the Lakeland fells, Alfred Wainwright called it "the Weisshorn of Buttermere". There are good views of Great Gable and the Scafells from the summit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Whiteless_Pike.jpg/280px-Whiteless_Pike.jpg
