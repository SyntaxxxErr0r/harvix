196.1	3-D_film	3D film	A 3-D film or S3D (stereoscopic 3D) film is a motion picture that enhances the illusion of depth perception. Derived from stereoscopic photography, a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives (or computer-generated imagery generates the two perspectives in post-production), and special projection hardware and/or eyewear are used to provide the illusion of depth when viewing the film. 3-D films are not limited to feature film theatrical releases; television broadcasts and direct-to-video films have also incorporated similar methods, primarily for marketing purposes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Anaglyph_glasses.png/220px-Anaglyph_glasses.png
