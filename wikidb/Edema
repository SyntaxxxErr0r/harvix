77.2	Edema	Edema	Edema or oedema (British English) (from the Greek - oídēma, "swelling"), formerly known as dropsy or hydropsy, is an abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin or in one or more cavities of the body that produces swelling. Generally, the amount of interstitial fluid is determined by the balance of fluid homeostasis, and increased secretion of fluid into the interstitium or impaired removal of this fluid may cause edema.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Combinpedal.jpg/220px-Combinpedal.jpg
