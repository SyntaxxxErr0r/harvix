55.4	Constructionist_learning	Constructionism (learning theory)	Constructionist learning is inspired by the constructivist theory that individual learners construct mental models to understand the world around them. However, constructionism holds that learning can happen most effectively when people are also active in making tangible objects in the real world. In this sense, constructionism is connected with experiential learning, and builds on Jean Piaget's epistemological theory of constructivism..	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Papert.jpg
