3.21	Boar_spear	Boar spear	A boar spear is a spear used for boar hunting. It is relatively short and heavy and has two "lugs" or "wings" on the spearsocket behind the blade, which act as a barrier to prevent an injured and furious boar from working its way up the shaft of the spear to attack the hunter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/HJRK_A_32_-_Boar_spear_head_of_Frederick_IV_of_the_Tyrol%2C_c._1430.jpg/150px-HJRK_A_32_-_Boar_spear_head_of_Frederick_IV_of_the_Tyrol%2C_c._1430.jpg
