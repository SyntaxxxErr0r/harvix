7.21	The_Tell_Tale_Heart	The Tell-Tale Heart	"The Tell-Tale Heart" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe first published in 1843. It follows an unnamed narrator who insists on his sanity after murdering an old man with a "vulture eye". The murder is carefully calculated, and the murderer hides the body by dismembering it and hiding it under the floorboards. Ultimately the narrator's guilt manifests itself in the hallucination that the man's heart is still beating under the floorboards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/The_Pioneer_Poe_1843_cover_2.jpg/220px-The_Pioneer_Poe_1843_cover_2.jpg
