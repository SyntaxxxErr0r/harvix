90.1	Plastic_surgery	Plastic surgery	Plastic surgery is a medical specialty concerned with the correction or restoration of form and function. Though cosmetic or aesthetic surgery is the best-known kind of plastic surgery, most plastic surgery is not cosmetic: plastic surgery includes many types of reconstructive surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Walter_Yeo_skin_graft.jpg/220px-Walter_Yeo_skin_graft.jpg
