4.10	Bush_pilot	Bush flying	Bush flying involves operations in rough terrain, necessitating bush planes to be equipped with tundra tires, floats, or skis. A bush plane should have good short take-off and landing capabilities. A typical bush plane will have wings on top of its fuselage to ensure that they do not make contact with any overgrowth in the landing area. They will normally have conventional "tail-dragger" landing gear as it has a greater aeronautic ability than tricycle landing gear, and is more suited to rough surfaces. The increased upward angle of the taildragger configuration gives the propeller more clearance from the ground allowing it to avoid striking large rocks, logs and other debris that might cause damage. However tricycle gear ("Nose wheel") bushplanes are capable of landing almost anywhere a tail dragger can, provided it is equipped with suitable oversize high flotation tires and is correctly loaded.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Unloading_a_float_plane_Nygren.jpg/220px-Unloading_a_float_plane_Nygren.jpg
