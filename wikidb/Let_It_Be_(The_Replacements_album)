13.41	Let_It_Be_(The_Replacements_album)	Let It Be (The Replacements album)	Let It Be is the third studio album from the American rock band The Replacements, released in October 1984 on Twin/Tone Records. By 1983's Hootenanny, the band had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively and decided to write songs that were, according to vocalist Paul Westerberg, "a little more sincere." Influenced by genres as diverse as metal, Chicago blues and arena rock, Let It Be featured more complex arrangements and songwriting than the band's previous albums. The album was very well received by critics and regarded among the greatest albums of the 80's. The album is now considered a classic and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best rock albums including placement as #239 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was remastered and reissued in 2008, with six additional tracks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/Replacements-LetItBe.jpg/220px-Replacements-LetItBe.jpg
