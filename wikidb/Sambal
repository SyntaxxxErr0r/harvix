69.3	Sambal	Sambal	Sambal is a chili based sauce which is normally used as a condiment. Sambals are popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the southern Philippines and Sri Lanka, as well as in the Netherlands and in Suriname through Javanese influence. It is typically made from a variety of chili peppers and is sometimes a substitute for fresh chilis. It can be extremely spicy for the uninitiated. Some ready-made sambals are available at exotic food markets or gourmet departments in supermarkets in many countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Anchovies_in_sambal.jpg/250px-Anchovies_in_sambal.jpg
