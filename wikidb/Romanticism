229.2	Romanticism	Romanticism	Romanticism (or the Romantic era/Period) was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century in Europe and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1840. Partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education and natural history.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Caspar_David_Friedrich_032.jpg/300px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_032.jpg
