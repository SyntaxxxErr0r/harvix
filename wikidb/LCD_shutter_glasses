54.5	LCD_shutter_glasses	Liquid crystal shutter glasses	Liquid crystal shutter glasses (also called LCS glasses, LCS 3D glasses, LC shutter glasses or active shutter glasses.) are glasses used in conjunction with a display screen to create the illusion of a three dimensional image, an example of stereoscopy. Each eye's glass contains a liquid crystal layer which has the property of becoming dark when voltage is applied, being otherwise transparent. The glasses are controlled by an infrared, radio frequency, DLP-Link or Bluetooth transmitter that sends a timing signal that allows the glasses to alternately darken over one eye, and then the other, in synchronization with the refresh rate of the screen. Meanwhile, the display alternately displays different perspectives for each eye, using a technique called alternate-frame sequencing, which achieves the desired effect of each eye seeing only the image intended for it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/CrystalEyes_shutter_glasses.jpg/220px-CrystalEyes_shutter_glasses.jpg
