61.0	Bismuth	Bismuth	Bismuth ( -m…ôth) is a chemical element with symbol Bi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a trivalent poor metal, chemically resembles arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally uncombined, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but is often seen in air with a pink tinge owing to surface oxidation. Bismuth metal has been known from ancient times, although until the 18th century, it was often confused with lead and tin, which each have some of the metal's bulk physical properties. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic bi ismid, meaning having the properties of antimony or German words weisse masse or wismuth meaning "white mass".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Bismuth_crystals_and_1cm3_cube.jpg/250px-Bismuth_crystals_and_1cm3_cube.jpg
