6.10	Garter_belt	Garter (stockings)	Garters are articles of clothing: narrow bands of fabric fastened about the leg, used to keep up stockings, and sometimes socks. Normally just a few inches in width, they are usually made of leather or heavy cloth, and adorned with small bells and/or ribbons. In the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, they were tied just below the knee, where the leg was slenderest, to keep the stocking from slipping. The advent of elastic has made them less necessary from this functional standpoint, although they are still often worn for fashion. Garters are worn by men and women.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Wedding_garter_in_plastic_holder.jpg/220px-Wedding_garter_in_plastic_holder.jpg
