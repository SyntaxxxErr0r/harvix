3.20	Seal_of_Rhode_Island	Seal of Rhode Island	The Seal of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations features a blue field with a golden maritime anchor as its central image below the phrase "HOPE." The anchor has been used as a symbol for Rhode Island since the colony's founding in 1636, well before the region claimed statehood.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Seal_of_Rhode_Island.svg/300px-Seal_of_Rhode_Island.svg.png
