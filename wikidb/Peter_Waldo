12.41	Peter_Waldo	Peter Waldo	Peter Waldo, Valdo, or Waldes (c. 1140 – c. 1218), also Pierre Vaudès or de Vaux, is credited as the founder of the Waldensians, a Christian spiritual movement of the Middle Ages, descendants of which still exist in various regions of southern Europe. Due to lack of reliable documentation there is a great degree of debate over Waldo's role in the Waldensian sect which may have existed before his leadership, while the French historian Thuanus dated his death to the year 1179.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/WaldoAtLutherDenkmal.JPG/220px-WaldoAtLutherDenkmal.JPG
