1.00	Tangelos	Tangelo	The tangelo ( -jə-loh; C. reticulata × C. maxima or x C. paradisi), Citrus × tangelo, is a citrus fruit hybrid of tangerine and pomelo or grapefruit. Widely known as honeybells, tangelos are the size of an adult fist, have a tangerine taste, and are juicy at the expense of flesh. They generally have loose skin and are easier to peel than oranges, readily distinguished from them by a characteristic "nipple" at the stem.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Minneola_fruit_3.jpg/220px-Minneola_fruit_3.jpg
