Ave." Bridge) is a steel haunched girder bridge between Back Bay, Boston to Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, carrying Massachusetts Avenue over the Charles River. It is the longest bridge over the Charles River at 659.82 meters (2,164.8 ft). It is locally known for being measured, inaccurately, in the idiosyncratic unit of length called the smoot.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Harvard_Bridge_20100116.jpg/250px-Harvard_Bridge_20100116.jpg
