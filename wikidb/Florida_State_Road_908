1.00	Florida_State_Road_908	Florida State Road 908	From the late 1950s to the 1970s, State Road 908 was a 13-mile-long east–west street in southern Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA (formerly Dade County). Locally, it was known as Southwest 232nd Street, Silver Palm Drive, and Bailes Road. Its western terminus was an intersection with Country Club Road (Southwest 202nd Avenue) in the Redlands; its eastern terminus was an intersection with Galloway Road (Southwest 87th Avenue) midway between Cutler Bay and Black Point. All but 1.3 miles (2.1 km) of SR 908 was on Silver Palm Drive—the section just east of South Dixie Highway was bypassed by using US 1 and Bailes Drive in Goulds.
