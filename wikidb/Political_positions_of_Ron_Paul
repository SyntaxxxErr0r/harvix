53.7	Political_positions_of_Ron_Paul	Political positions of Ron Paul	The political positions of Ron Paul , United States presidential candidate in 1988, 2008, and 2012, have been labeled conservative, Constitutionalist, and libertarian. Paul's nickname "Dr. No" reflects both his medical degree and his assertion that he will "never vote for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution". This position has frequently resulted in Paul casting the sole "no" vote against proposed legislation. The central tenet of Paul's political philosophy is that "the proper role for government in America is to provide national defense, a court system for civil disputes, a criminal justice system for acts of force and fraud, and little else."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Ron_Paul%2C_official_Congressional_photo_portrait%2C_2007.jpg/220px-Ron_Paul%2C_official_Congressional_photo_portrait%2C_2007.jpg
