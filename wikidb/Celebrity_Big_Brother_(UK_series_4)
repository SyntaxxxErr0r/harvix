1.00	Celebrity_Big_Brother_(UK_series_4)	Celebrity Big Brother 2006 (UK)	Celebrity Big Brother 2006 was the fourth series of Celebrity Big Brother, which started on 5 January 2006 and finished on 27 January 2006, running for three weeks. The series aired on Channel 4. This is the first series of Big Brother UK to be produced by Brighter Pictures, a subsidiary of Endemol UK, instead of by the parent company. The first housemate to enter the house (and the eventual winner) was Chantelle, a girl from Essex and the first non-celebrity in a celebrity series. Her first task was to convince her celebrity housemates that she was actually a genuine celebrity herself â€“ failure would have meant that she would have been evicted on Day 4. She was told to play the character of a pop star from the fictitious girl band "Kandy Floss", and that her biggest 'hit' was "I Want It Right Now". She succeeded in convincing the other housemates, and was allowed to stay. This particular series was noted sometimes for its comedy, but more often for the extreme conflict that frequently broke out between the house mates versus Pete Burns' wearing of fur. Big Brother occasionally played on the conflict, or widening the already-present rift between them by encouraging each side to deceive one another in various events. By the time of the series Finale, six housemates remained in the House. This was a first in Big Brother UK history and the next (non-celebrity) series, series 7, also adopted this format.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/Celebrity_Big_Brother_UK_4_logo.png/180px-Celebrity_Big_Brother_UK_4_logo.png
