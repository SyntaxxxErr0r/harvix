2.00	Timing_closure	Timing closure	Timing closure is the process by which an FPGA or a VLSI design is modified to meet its timing requirements. Most of the modifications are handled by EDA tools based on directives given by a designer. The term is also used for the goal that is achieved, when such a design has reached the end of the flow and its timing requirements are satisfied.
