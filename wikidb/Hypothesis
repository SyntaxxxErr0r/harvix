95.6	Hypothesis	Hypothesis	A hypothesis (from Greek ; plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. The term derives from the Greek, ὑποτιθέναι – hypotithenai meaning "to put under" or "to suppose". For a hypothesis to be put forward as a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words "hypothesis" and "theory" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Cellarius_Harmonia_Macrocosmica_-_Hypothesis_Ptolemaica.jpg/220px-Cellarius_Harmonia_Macrocosmica_-_Hypothesis_Ptolemaica.jpg
