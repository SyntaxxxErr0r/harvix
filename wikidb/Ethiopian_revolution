2.00	Ethiopian_revolution	Ethiopian Civil War	The Ethiopian Civil War began on November 28, 1974 when the Marxist Derg staged a coup d'état against Emperor Haile Selassie, and lasted until the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of rebel groups, overthrew the government in 1991. The war overlapped other Cold War conflicts in Africa, such as the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002). The war left 230,000-1.4 million dead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/T-55s_civil_war.JPG/300px-T-55s_civil_war.JPG
