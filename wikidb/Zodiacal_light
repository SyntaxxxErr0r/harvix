62.3	Zodiacal_light	Zodiacal light	Zodiacal light is a faint, roughly triangular, diffuse white glow seen in the night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the Sun along the ecliptic or zodiac. It is best seen just after sunset and before sunrise in spring and autumn when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. Caused by sunlight scattered by space dust in the zodiacal cloud, it is so faint that either moonlight or light pollution renders it invisible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Cantin1.jpg/170px-Cantin1.jpg
