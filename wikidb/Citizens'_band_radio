57.1	Citizens'_band_radio	Citizens Band radio	Citizens' Band radio (also known as CB radio) is, in many countries, a system of short-distance radio communications between individuals on a selection of 40 channels within the 27-MHz (11 m) band. Citizens' Band is distinct from the FRS, GMRS, MURS and amateur ("ham") radio. In many countries CB operation does not require a license, and (unlike amateur radio) it may be used for business or personal communications. Like many other two-way radio services, Citizens' Band channels are shared by many users. Only one station may transmit at a time; other stations must listen and wait for the shared channel to be available.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/CB_Base_Station.jpg/220px-CB_Base_Station.jpg
