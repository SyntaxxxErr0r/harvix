1.00	C-32_highway_(Spain)	C-32 highway (Spain)	C-32 is a primary highway in Catalonia, Spain. It was created in 2004 by merging three sections of existing autopistas and autov√≠as. This re-organisation was part of a renaming of primary highways managed by the Generalitat de Catalunya. According to this new denomination, the first number (C-32) indicates that is a southwest-northeast highway (parallel to the Mediterranean Sea coastline), while the second number (C-32) indicates that is the second closest to the Mediterranean Sea.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/C-32.svg/120px-C-32.svg.png
