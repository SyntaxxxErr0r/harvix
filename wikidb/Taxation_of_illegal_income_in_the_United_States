2.10	Taxation_of_illegal_income_in_the_United_States	Taxation of illegal income in the United States	In the United States, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) was enacted by the U.S. Congress in part for the purpose of taxing net income. The Code is not a mechanism for enforcing other codes of law, for example, criminal law. A personâ€™s taxable income will generally be subject to the same Federal income tax rules, regardless of whether the income was obtained legally or illegally.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/US-GreatSeal-Obverse.svg/100px-US-GreatSeal-Obverse.svg.png
