6.10	Lord_Guildford_Dudley	Lord Guildford Dudley	Lord Guildford Dudley (also spelt Guilford) (c. 1535 â€“ 12 February 1554) was the husband of Lady Jane Grey who, declared as his heir by King Edward VI, occupied the English throne from 6/10 July till 19 July 1553. Guildford Dudley enjoyed a humanist education and was married to Jane in a magnificent celebration about six weeks before the King's death. After Guildford's father, the Duke of Northumberland, had engineered Jane's accession, Jane and Guildford spent their brief rule residing in the Tower of London, acting in the roles of queen and king. Guildford's demand to be made an actual king was declined by Jane, however. They were still in the Tower when their regime collapsed and remained there, in different quarters, as prisoners. They were condemned to death for high treason in November 1553. Queen Mary I was inclined to spare their lives, but Thomas Wyatt's rebellion against her plans to marry Philip of Spain led to the young couple's execution, a measure that was widely seen as unduly harsh.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/The_Crown_Offered_to_Lady_Jane_Grey_after_Leslie.jpg/300px-The_Crown_Offered_to_Lady_Jane_Grey_after_Leslie.jpg
