1.00	Pulmonary_Function	Pulmonary function testing	Pulmonary Function Testing is a complete evaluation of the respiratory system including patient history, physical examinations, chest x-ray examinations, arterial blood gas analysis, and tests of pulmonary function. The primary purpose of pulmonary function testing is to identify the severity of pulmonary impairment. Pulmonary function testing has diagnostic and therapeutic roles and helps clinicians answer some general questions about patients with lung disease. PFT's are performed by a Pulmonary scientist who typically hold credentialing as a Registered Pulmonary Function Technician, a Certified Pulmonary Function Technician or a Registered Respiratory Therapist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Lungvolumes.svg/220px-Lungvolumes.svg.png
