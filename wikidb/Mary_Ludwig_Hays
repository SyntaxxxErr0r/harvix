4.00	Mary_Ludwig_Hays	Molly Pitcher	Molly Pitcher was a nickname given to a woman said to have fought in the American Revolutionary War, who is generally believed to have been Mary Ludwig Hays. Since various Molly Pitcher tales grew in the telling, many historians regard Molly Pitcher as folklore rather than history, or suggest that Molly Pitcher may be a composite image inspired by the actions of a number of real women. The name itself may have originated as a nickname given to women who carried water to men on the battlefield during the war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Molly_Pitcher_currier_ives.jpg/220px-Molly_Pitcher_currier_ives.jpg
