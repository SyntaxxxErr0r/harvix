It serves as a general introduction to the eponymous subject, intended to be accessible to those with little technical knowledge of the area. It has been highly successful, considered by many as the definitive publication of its type. The original version was updated several times, and a Canto edition, with a foreword by Richard Dawkins, and newly-written introduction by the author, was published in 1996.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/The_Theory_of_Evolution_cover.jpg
