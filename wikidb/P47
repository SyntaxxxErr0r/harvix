2.10	P47	Republic P-47 Thunderbolt	Republic Aviation's P-47 Thunderbolt, also known as the "Jug", was the largest, heaviest, and most expensive fighter aircraft in history to be powered by a single reciprocating engine. It was heavily armed with eight .50-caliber machine guns, four per wing. When fully loaded, the P-47 weighed up to eight tons, and in the fighter-bomber ground attack roles could carry five inch rockets or a significant bomb load of 2,500 poundsâ€”over half the weight the famous B-17 bomber could carry on long-range missions. The P-47, based on the powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engine, was to be very effective as a short-to-medium range escort fighter in high-altitude air-to-air combat and when unleashed as a fighter-bomber, proved especially adept at ground attack in both the WW-II European and Pacific Theaters.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/P-47D-40_Thunderbolt_44-95471_side.jpg/300px-P-47D-40_Thunderbolt_44-95471_side.jpg
