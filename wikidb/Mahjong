The four-player table version is not the same as the single player tile matching game Mahjong solitaire. Similar to the Western card game rummy, mahjong is a game of skill, strategy and calculation and involves a certain degree of chance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Mahjong_in_Hangzhou.jpg/200px-Mahjong_in_Hangzhou.jpg
