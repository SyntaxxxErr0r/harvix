53.5	Natural-born_citizen	Natural-born-citizen clause	Status as a natural-born citizen of the United States is one of the eligibility requirements established in the United States Constitution for election to the office of President or Vice President. This requirement was an attempt to allay concerns that foreign aristocrats might immigrate to the new nation and use their wealth and influence to impose a monarchy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/NaturalBornCitizenClause.jpg/500px-NaturalBornCitizenClause.jpg
