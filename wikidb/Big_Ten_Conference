56.9	Big_Ten_Conference	Big Ten Conference	The Big Ten Conference is the United States' oldest Division I college athletic conference. Its twelve member institutions (which are primarily flagship research universities in their respective states, well-regarded academically, and with relatively large student enrollment) are located primarily in the Midwestern United States, stretching from Nebraska in the west to Pennsylvania in the east, and from Indiana in the south to Minnesota in the north. The conference competes in the NCAA's Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport. Member schools of the Big Ten also are members of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, a leading educational consortium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Big_Ten_Conference_logo_%282012%29.svg/225px-Big_Ten_Conference_logo_%282012%29.svg.png
