It has been considered a subspecies of A. varius, but is now generally regarded as a separate species. While the IUCN still lists it as critically endangered, it may have been extinct in the wild since 2007. Individuals have been collected for breeding in captivity in a bid to preserve the species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Atelopus_zeteki1.jpg/220px-Atelopus_zeteki1.jpg
