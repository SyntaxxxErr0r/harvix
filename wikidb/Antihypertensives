4.00	Antihypertensives	Antihypertensive drug	The antihypertensives are a class of drugs that are used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). Evidence suggests that reduction of the blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischaemic heart disease by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease. There are many classes of antihypertensives, which lower blood pressure by different means; among the most important and most widely used are the thiazide diuretics, the ACE inhibitors, the calcium channel blockers, the beta blockers, and the angiotensin II receptor antagonists or ARBs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Hydrochlorothiazide.png/220px-Hydrochlorothiazide.png
