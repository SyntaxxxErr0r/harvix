1.00	Yangier	Yangiyer	Yangiyer (Uzbek: ; Russian: ) is a city (1991 pop. 29.600) in Sirdaryo Province, Eastern Uzbekistan. It was established in 1957 as part of the grand Soviet project to cultivate the naturally saline virgin lands of Golodnaya Steppe, a vast area of about 10,000 square kilometres in Eastern Uzbekistan. The shortage of irrigation water was the main problem hindering the development of agriculture in the area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Yangier.jpg/260px-Yangier.jpg
