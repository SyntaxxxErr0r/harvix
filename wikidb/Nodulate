1.01	Nodulate	Root nodule	Root nodules occur on the roots of plants (primarily Fabaceae) that associate with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, capable plants form a symbiotic relationship with a host-specific strain of bacteria known as rhizobia. This process has evolved multiple times within the Fabaceae, as well as in other species found within the Rosid clade.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Root-nodule01.jpg/300px-Root-nodule01.jpg
