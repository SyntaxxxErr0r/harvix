Shortly after being presented as Miss America, the newly crowned 17-year-old winner left Atlantic City and returned home, missing scheduled appointments her first day on the job, as well as a theater appearance and a trip to Hollywood. Her father cited illness as the reason. Though not placing in the top five, representatives from different areas of New York captured three of the semi-finalist positions.
