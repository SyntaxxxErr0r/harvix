138.0	Tapas	Tapas	Tapas are a wide variety of appetizers, or snacks, in Spanish cuisine. They may be cold (such as mixed olives and cheese) or warm (such as chopitos, which are battered, fried baby squid). In select bars in Spain, tapas have evolved into an entire, and sometimes sophisticated, cuisine. In Spain, patrons of tapas can order many different tapas and combine them to make a full meal. In some Central American countries, such snacks are known as bocas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/TapasenBarcelona.JPG/300px-TapasenBarcelona.JPG
