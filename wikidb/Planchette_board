2.02	Planchette_board	Planchette	A planchette ( ), from the French for "little plank", is a small, usually heart-shaped flat piece of wood that one moves around on a board to spell out messages or answer questions. Paranormal advocates believe that the planchette is moved by some extra-normal force. The motion is allegedly due to the ideomotor effect. In occult usage, a pencil would be attached to the planchette, writing letters or other designs on paper to be later interpreted by a medium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/English_ouija_board.jpg/220px-English_ouija_board.jpg
