72.7	Chicago_school_(economics)	Chicago school of economics	The Chicago school of economics describes a neoclassical school of thought within the academic community of economists, with a strong focus around the faculty of The University of Chicago, some of whom have constructed and popularized its principles. It is at times referred to as freshwater school of economics, in contrast to the saltwater school based in coastal universities (notably Harvard, MIT, and Berkeley). The University of Chicago department, considered one of the world's foremost economics departments, has fielded more Nobel Prize laureates and John Bates Clark medalists in economics than any other university.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/EffectOfTariff.svg/150px-EffectOfTariff.svg.png
