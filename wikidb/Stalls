2.00	Stalls	Choir (architecture)	Architecturally, the choir is the area of a church or cathedral, usually in the western part of the chancel between the nave and the sanctuary (which houses the altar). The choir is occasionally located in the eastern part of the nave. In some monastic churches the choir occupies the western end of the nave and thus counterbalances the chancel and sanctuary.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Cathedral.architecture.bristol.arp.jpg/220px-Cathedral.architecture.bristol.arp.jpg
