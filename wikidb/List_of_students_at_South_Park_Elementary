He is often treated poorly by other characters and put in painful or humiliating situations. As a result of his increasing popularity with the show's staff and fans, Butters was given a more prominent role beginning with the show's fifth season (2001).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/36/SPClass.jpg/500px-SPClass.jpg
