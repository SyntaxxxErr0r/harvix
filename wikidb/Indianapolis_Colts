55.5	Indianapolis_Colts	Indianapolis Colts	The Indianapolis Colts are a professional American football team based in Indianapolis. They are members of the South Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The club was officially founded in Baltimore, Maryland in 1953, but can trace its history to the Dayton Triangles, a founding member of the NFL that was originally created in 1913. After a series of changes, it assumed the name Baltimore Colts, replacing a previous team of that name that folded in 1950. Playing at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium, the Colts became the first NFL team to have cheerleaders. The team then relocated to Indianapolis in 1984, first playing at the Hoosier Dome, which was then renamed the RCA Dome, before moving to Lucas Oil Stadium in 2008.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/Indianapolis_Colts_logo.svg/100px-Indianapolis_Colts_logo.svg.png
