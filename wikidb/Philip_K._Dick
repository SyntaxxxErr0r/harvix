128.4	Philip_K._Dick	Philip K. Dick	Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 â€“ March 2, 1982) was an American novelist, short story writer and essayist whose published work is almost entirely in the science fiction genre. Dick explored sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments and altered states. In his later works Dick's thematic focus strongly reflected his personal interest in metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life experiences in addressing the nature of drug abuse, paranoia and schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and VALIS.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/PhilipDick.jpg/200px-PhilipDick.jpg
