Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on Sunday, December 7, 1941, brought the United States into World War II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Ford_Island_aerial_photo_RIMPAC_1986.JPEG/250px-Ford_Island_aerial_photo_RIMPAC_1986.JPEG
