168.4	Permalink	Permalink	A permalink is a URL that points to a specific blog or forum entry after it has passed from the front page to the archives. Because a permalink remains unchanged indefinitely, it is less susceptible to link rot. Most modern weblogging and content-syndication software systems support such links. Other types of websites use the term permanent links, but the term permalink is most common within the blogosphere. Permalinks are often simply stated so as to be human-readable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/Wikipedia_permalink_example.png/200px-Wikipedia_permalink_example.png
