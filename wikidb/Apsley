6.21	Apsley	Apsley	Apsley is a 19th century mill town in the county of Hertfordshire, England. It is a historic industrial site situated in a valley of the Chiltern Hills. It is positioned below the confluence of two permanent rivers, the Gade and Bulbourne. In an area of little surface water this was an obvious site for the location of water mills serving local agriculture. Today it is a district of the larger town of Hemel Hempstead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Apsley_-_White_Lion.jpg/250px-Apsley_-_White_Lion.jpg
