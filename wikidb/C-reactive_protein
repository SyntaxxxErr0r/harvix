63.1	C-reactive_protein	C-reactive protein	C-reactive protein is a protein found in the blood, the levels of which rise in response to inflammation (i.e. C-reactive protein is an acute-phase protein). Its physiological role is to bind to phosphocholine expressed on the surface of dead or dying cells (and some types of bacteria) in order to activate the complement system via the C1Q complex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/PDB_1b09_EBI.jpg/250px-PDB_1b09_EBI.jpg
