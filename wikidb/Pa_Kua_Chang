1.00	Pa_Kua_Chang	Baguazhang	Bāguàzhǎng is one of the three main Chinese martial arts of the Wudang school, the other two being Taijiquan and Xingyiquan. It is more broadly grouped as an internal practice (or neijia gong). Bāguà zhǎng literally means "eight trigram palm," referring to the trigrams of the Yijing , one of the canons of Taoism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Sun_bagua.jpg
