1.00	Slavery_in_New_Jersey	History of slavery in New Jersey	Slavery in New Jersey began in the early 17th century shortly after Dutch settlement. After England took the colony in 1664, it continued the importation of slaves from Africa, as well as "seasoned" slaves from their colonies in the West Indies and enslaved Native Americans from the Carolinas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg/120px-Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg.png
