6.00	Anolis_oculatus	Dominican Anole	The Dominican Anole or Eyed Anole is a species of anole lizard. It is endemic to the Caribbean island of Dominica, where it is found in most environments. It is distributed in four main population groups on the island, which were initially described as subspecies and now are recognized as ecotypes. It has a very diverse morphology between these populations, with a ground color that ranges from pale tan or yellow to deep green or brown. It also has patterned markings that range from light-colored speckling to complex marbled patterns, and some populations also have large black-ringed "eye" spots on their flanks. This diversity is the product of adaptation to different ecological conditions found within Dominica, which has made it the subject of numerous studies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Anolis_oculatus_at_Coulibistrie-a01.jpg/200px-Anolis_oculatus_at_Coulibistrie-a01.jpg
