1.00	In_a_Little_Red_Barn_(On_a_Farm_Down_in_Indiana)	In a Little Red Barn (On a Farm Down in Indiana)	"In a Little Red Barn (on a Farm down in Indiana)" was a popular song written by Joe Young, Jean Schwartz, and Milton Ager in 1934. It used the same harmonic structure as the 1917 "Back Home Again in Indiana" (also called just "Indiana"). Both "In a Little Red Barn" and "Indiana" borrowed many of the same words and phrases used in the 1913 "On the Banks of the Wabash".
