2.00	Panchayath	Panchayati raj	The panchayat raj is a South Asian political system mainly in India, Pakistan, and Nepal. The word "panchayat" literally means assembly of five (panch) wise and respected elders chosen and accepted by the local community. However, there are different forms of assemblies. Traditionally, these assemblies settled disputes between individuals and villages. Modern Indian government has decentralized several administrative functions to the local level, empowering elected gram panchayats. Gram panchayats are not to be confused with the unelected khap panchayats (or caste panchayats) found in some parts of India.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Emblem_of_India.svg/108px-Emblem_of_India.svg.png
