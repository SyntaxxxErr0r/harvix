1.00	ANKS	A New Kind of Science	A New Kind of Science is a best-selling, award-winning book by Stephen Wolfram, published in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as cellular automata. Wolfram calls these systems simple programs and argues that the scientific philosophy and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/A_new_kind_of_science.PNG/220px-A_new_kind_of_science.PNG
