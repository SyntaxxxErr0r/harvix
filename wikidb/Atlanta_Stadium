1.00	Atlanta_Stadium	Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium	Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, often shortened to "Fulton County Stadium" and originally known simply as Atlanta Stadium, was a multi-purpose stadium that formerly stood in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The stadium was built to attract a Major League Baseball team, which it did in 1966 when the Milwaukee Braves moved from Wisconsin to Georgia to play. The Braves and Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League shared the venue from 1966 until 1991, when the Falcons moved into the specifically-built for them Georgia Dome. The Braves stayed at Fulton County Stadium until the end of the 1996 season, when they moved into a converted Centennial Olympic Stadium, which was built for the 1996 Summer Olympics that were held in Atlanta and was renamed Turner Field once the Braves moved in.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Atlanta_Stadium.jpg/250px-Atlanta_Stadium.jpg
