54.5	Microsoft_Kin	Microsoft Kin	Kin (often stylized as KIN) is a family of mobile phones from Microsoft that were sold through Verizon Wireless. After several years of development, at a cost of approximately US$1 billion, Kin became part of the larger Windows Phone family, and was billed as a "close cousin" of Windows Phone. On April 12, 2010, Microsoft announced two Kin models, both available online on May 6, 2010 and in stores on May 13, 2010 from Verizon Wireless for the U.S.; the phones were due for release in autumn of 2010 on Vodafone for Europe, but European plans were scrapped due to poor U.S. sales. Since then, the two phones have ceased production, the Kin development team has been folded into the Windows Phone team, and Microsoft has stopped promoting the devices. The Microsoft-designed phones were manufactured by Sharp. The Kin phone was aimed at users of social networking. Microsoft described the phones' target demographic as men and women between the ages of 15 and 30.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/KIN_logo.svg/150px-KIN_logo.svg.png
