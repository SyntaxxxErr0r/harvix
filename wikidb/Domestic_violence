162.3	Domestic_violence	Domestic violence	Domestic violence, also known as domestic abuse, spousal abuse, battering, family violence, and intimate partner violence (IPV), is defined as a pattern of abusive behaviors by one partner against another in an intimate relationship such as marriage, dating, family, or cohabitation. Domestic violence, so defined, has many forms, including physical aggression or assault (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, slapping, throwing objects), or threats thereof; sexual abuse; emotional abuse; controlling or domineering; intimidation; stalking; passive/covert abuse (e.g., neglect); and economic deprivation. Alcohol consumption and mental illness can be co-morbid with abuse, and present additional challenges in eliminating domestic violence. Awareness, perception, definition and documentation of domestic violence differs widely from country to country, and from era to era.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Kalighat_Painting_Calcutta_19th_Century_-_Woman_Strinking_Man_With_Broom.jpg/220px-Kalighat_Painting_Calcutta_19th_Century_-_Woman_Strinking_Man_With_Broom.jpg
