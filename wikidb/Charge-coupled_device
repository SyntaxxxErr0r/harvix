176.3	Charge-coupled_device	Charge-coupled device	A charge-coupled device is a device for the movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value. This is achieved by "shifting" the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/CCD.jpg/300px-CCD.jpg
