51.6	Naturalistic_fallacy	Naturalistic fallacy	The phrase naturalistic fallacy, with "fallacy" referring to a formal fallacy, has several meanings. It can be used to refer to the claim that what is natural is inherently good or right, and that what is unnatural is bad or wrong (see also "Appeal to nature"). This naturalistic fallacy is the converse of the moralistic fallacy, the notion that what is good or right is natural and inherent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bc/Principia_Ethica_title_page.png/200px-Principia_Ethica_title_page.png
