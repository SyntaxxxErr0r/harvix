72.6	William_Cowper	William Cowper	William Cowper ( -pər; 26 November 1731 – 25 April 1800) was an English poet and hymnodist. One of the most popular poets of his time, Cowper changed the direction of 18th century nature poetry by writing of everyday life and scenes of the English countryside. In many ways, he was one of the forerunners of Romantic poetry. Samuel Taylor Coleridge called him "the best modern poet", whilst William Wordsworth particularly admired his poem Yardley-Oak. He was a nephew of the poet Judith Madan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/William_Cowper_by_Lemuel_Francis_Abbott.jpg/220px-William_Cowper_by_Lemuel_Francis_Abbott.jpg
