2.00	Jack-up	Jackup rig	A jack-up rig is a type of mobile platform that is able to stand still on the sea floor, resting on a number of supporting legs. The most popular designs use 3 independent legs, although some jackups have 4 legs or more. On "mat-type" jackups the legs are connected to a submerged hull.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Constellation_1.JPG/220px-Constellation_1.JPG
