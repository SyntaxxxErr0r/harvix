1.00	African_softshell_turtle	African softshell turtle	The African softshell turtle (Trionyx triunguis), or Nile softshell turtle, is a large species of turtle from fresh water and brackish habitats in Africa (larger parts of East, West and Middle Africa) and the Near East . It is the only extant species from the genus Trionyx, but in the past many other softshell turtles were placed in this genus. They have now been moved to various other genera. Despite the name African softshell turtle, it is not the only species or genus of softshell turtle in Africa (the genera Cyclanorbis and Cycloderma are also African).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/AlexanderRiver_Turtle.JPG/220px-AlexanderRiver_Turtle.JPG
