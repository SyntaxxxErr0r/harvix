10.23	Clan_Gunn	Clan Gunn	Clan Gunn is a Scottish clan associated with northeastern Scotland, including Caithness and Sutherland as well as the Orkney Islands.The clan's origins stretch over the sea to Norway, and the Clan Gunn themselves claim descent from the legendary viking Sweyn Asleifsson, the progenitor of the clan, and through his grandson Gunni, considered to be the "namefather" of Clan Gunn. The clan is an armigerous clan, without a chief, so the Lord Lyon has recognized a clan commander.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Clan_member_crest_badge_-_Clan_Gunn.svg/190px-Clan_member_crest_badge_-_Clan_Gunn.svg.png
