3.10	Phoenician_script	Phoenician alphabet	The Phoenician alphabet, called by convention the Proto-Canaanite alphabet for inscriptions older than around 1050 BC, was a non-pictographic consonantal alphabet, or abjad. It was used for the writing of Phoenician, a Northern Semitic language, used by the civilization of Phoenicia. It has been classified as an abjad because it records only consonantal sounds, with the addition of matres lectionis for some vowels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Phoenician_alphabet.svg/200px-Phoenician_alphabet.svg.png
