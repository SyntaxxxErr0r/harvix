82.0	Fatty_acid	Fatty acid	In chemistry, especially biochemistry, a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with a long aliphatic tail , which is either saturated or unsaturated. Most naturally occurring fatty acids have a chain of an even number of carbon atoms, from 4 to 28. Fatty acids are usually derived from triglycerides or phospholipids. When they are not attached to other molecules, they are known as "free" fatty acids. Fatty acids are important sources of fuel because, metabolized, they yield large quantities of ATP. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this purpose. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. The brain cannot use fatty acids as a source of fuel; it relies on glucose or ketone bodies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Butyric_acid_acsv.svg/220px-Butyric_acid_acsv.svg.png
