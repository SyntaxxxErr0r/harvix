98.5	11_Truth_movement	9/11 Truth movement	On the morning of Tuesday September 11, 2001, terrorists from al-Qaeda hijacked four passenger jets, intentionally crashing two into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City causing both towers to collapse. The hijackers crashed another into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. The fourth jet crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Adherents of the 9/11 Truth Movement claim that this mainstream explanation of the 9/11 events contains significant inconsistencies which suggest, at the least, a cover-up, and at worst, complicity by insiders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/9-11_Truth_1.jpg/300px-9-11_Truth_1.jpg
