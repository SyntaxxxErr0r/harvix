54.0	Montreal_Screwjob	Montreal Screwjob	The Montreal Screwjob was a controversial, purportedly real life professional wrestling event in which the owner of the World Wrestling Federation, Vince McMahon, double-crossed the defending WWF Champion, Bret Hart, during the main event match of the professional wrestling pay-per-view event Survivor Series held on November 9, 1997 at the Molson Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A secret manipulation of the match's result (known as a "shoot screwjob" in professional wrestling parlance) was devised by McMahon and discussed with Hart's match opponent, Shawn Michaels. It was decided by McMahon that Shawn Michaels would win the contest, and the WWF title, from Bret Hart no matter what. The plan was executed when the match referee, Earl Hebner, under orders from McMahon, called for the bell to ring and ended the match as Michaels held Hart in the Sharpshooter submission hold (which was Hart's signature finishing move), even though Hart had not submitted. Michaels was declared the victor by submission and crowned as the new WWF Champion. It would mark the last of three WWF Championship matches between the two, having previously headlined the 1992 Survivor Series and WrestleMania XII together.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/Seriesscrewjob.jpg/275px-Seriesscrewjob.jpg
