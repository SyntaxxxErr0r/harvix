23.42	Whiplash_(comics)	Whiplash (comics)	The first and most well-known Whiplash was Mark Scarlotti, a recurring foe of Iron Man who debuted in Tales of Suspense #97 (Jan. 1968) and whose first storyline ended in Iron Man #1 (May 1968), the first issue of Iron Man's solo title. Scarlotti was an extremely gifted technician at Stark International's Cincinnati branch, but he never received recognition for his hard work or scientific acumen. Jealous of the global renown for Tony Stark's brilliance and the celebrity it granted him, Scarlotti decided to become a costumed supervillain. Adopting the moniker Whiplash, he constructed a metallic, electrified whip capable of rending apart even the strongest of metals. As Whiplash, Scarlotti worked for the Maggia before becoming an underworld enforcer for shady industrialist Justin Hammer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Comic_image_missing.svg/125px-Comic_image_missing.svg.png
