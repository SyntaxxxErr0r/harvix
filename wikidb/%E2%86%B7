1.00	%E2%86%B7	Arrow (symbol)	An arrow is a graphical symbol such as → or ←, used to point or indicate direction, being in its simplest form a line segment with a triangle affixed to one end, and in more complex forms a representation of an actual arrow (e.g. U+27B5). The direction indicated by an arrow is the one along the length of the line towards the end capped by a triangle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Arrows_in_Okazaki.jpeg/300px-Arrows_in_Okazaki.jpeg
