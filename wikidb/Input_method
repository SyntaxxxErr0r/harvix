29.72	Input_method	Input method	An input method is an operating system component or program that allows any data, such as keyboard strokes or mouse movements, to be received as input. In this way users can enter characters and symbols not found on their input devices. For instance, on the computer, this allows the user of Latin keyboards to input Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indic characters; on many hand-held devices, such as mobile phones, it enables using the numeric keypad to enter Latin alphabet characters (or any other alphabet characters) or a screen display to be touched to do so.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Ob_gif_ch.gif/220px-Ob_gif_ch.gif
