1.00	Paper_Rival	Paper Rival	Paper Rival was an indie rock band formed in late 2005 from Nashville, Tennessee. Originally known as Keating, the band changed its name to Paper Rival in 2007 after a tour in Canada where the band was mistaken for a Canadian band who already possessed the name. In December 2007, Paper Rival was named Spin.com's "Artist of the Day." The band released its debut full-length album, Dialog on May 20, 2008. The group cites artists Blind Lemon Jefferson, Merle Haggard and Bruce Cockburn (whose song Pacing the Cage was covered on their 2007 self-titled EP) as musical inspirations.
