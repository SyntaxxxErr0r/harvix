168.8	Ecosystem	Ecosystem	An ecosystem is a biological system consisting of all the living organisms or biotic components in a particular area and the nonliving or abiotic component with which the organisms interact, such as air, mineral soil, water and sunlight. Key processes in ecosystems include the capture of light energy and carbon through photosynthesis, the transfer of carbon and energy through food webs, and the release of nutrients and carbon through decomposition. Biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning, as do the processes of disturbance and succession.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Blue_Linckia_Starfish.JPG/275px-Blue_Linckia_Starfish.JPG
