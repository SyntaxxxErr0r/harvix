1.00	Billion_Dollar_Babies_(Alice_Cooper_song)	Billion Dollar Babies (song)	Billion Dollar Babies is a popular 1973 single by rock group Alice Cooper, taken from the album "Billion Dollar Babies". It was released in July 1973, months after the album had been released. The track is a duet between Alice Cooper and Donovan, who provides the falsetto vocals. BMI lists the composers of "Billion Dollar Babies" as Alice Cooper, Michael Bruce and Reggie Vinson (a session guitarist who had worked with the Alice Cooper band previously.). Some sources list the composers as Cooper, Bruce, drummer Neal Smith, and "R. Reggie" . The chorus has the same melody as The Hollies's 1966 song "Tell Me to My Face." Billion Dollar Babies also became the name of a band which descended from the Alice Cooper band that recorded the song. The Billion Dollar Babies album was one of the last recorded by the Alice Cooper band, before singer Alice Cooper went solo. Legal complications ensued; all five Alice Cooper band members had shared ownership of the band's name. The original band never again recorded under the name Alice Cooper, but former Alice Cooper Band members Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway, and Neal Smith, along with additions Bob Dolin and Mike Marconi, recorded as Billion Dollar Babies. . The band Billion Dollar Babies only released one album, 1977's 'Battleaxe', before disbanding.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Alicecooperbilliondollarbabies.jpg/220px-Alicecooperbilliondollarbabies.jpg
