10.10	Logical_volume_manager	Logical volume management	Most volume-manager implementations share the same basic design. They start with physical volumes (PVs), which can be either hard disks, hard disk partitions, or Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) of an external storage device. Volume management treats PVs as sequences of chunks called physical extents (PEs). Some volume managers (such as that in HP-UX and Linux) have PEs of a uniform size; others (such as that in Veritas) have variably-sized PEs that can be split and merged at will.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/LVM1.svg/500px-LVM1.svg.png
