2.00	Madhusudana_Saraswati	Madhusūdana Sarasvatī	Madhusūdana Sarasvatī (c.1540–1640) was an Indian philosopher in the Advaita Vedānta tradition. He was the disciple of viSveSvara sarasvatI and mAdhava sarasvatI, and is the most celebrated name in the annals of the great dvaita-advaita debate. His Advaitasiddhi is a classic work, and most Advaita teachers maintain that all the logical issues raised by the dvaita school of AnandatIrtha have been sufficiently answered by Madhusūdana.
