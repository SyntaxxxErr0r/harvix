141.7	Green_tea	Green tea	Green tea is made solely from the leaves of Camellia sinensis that have undergone minimal oxidation during processing. Green tea originates from China and has become associated with many cultures throughout Asia. It has recently become more widespread in the West, where black tea is traditionally consumed. Many varieties of green tea have been created in countries where they are grown. These varieties can differ substantially due to variable growing conditions, horticulture, production processing, and harvesting time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Green_tea_3_appearances.jpg/220px-Green_tea_3_appearances.jpg
