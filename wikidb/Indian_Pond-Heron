2.00	Indian_Pond-Heron	Indian Pond Heron	The Indian Pond Heron or Paddybird is a small heron. It is of Old World origins, breeding in southern Iran and east to India, Burma, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. They are widespread and common but can be easily missed when they stalk prey at the edge of small water-bodies or even when they roost close to human habitations. They are however distinctive when put to flight, the bright white wings flashing in contrast to the cryptic streaked olive and brown colours of the body. The camouflage is so excellent that they will often allow humans to approach very close before taking to flight, and this has resulted in folk names and beliefs that the birds are short-sighted or blind.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Indian_Pond_Heron_in_Sri_Lanka.jpg/220px-Indian_Pond_Heron_in_Sri_Lanka.jpg
