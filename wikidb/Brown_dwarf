88.5	Brown_dwarf	Brown dwarf	Brown dwarfs, a term coined by Jill Tarter in 1975, were originally called black dwarfs, a classification for dark substellar objects floating freely in space which were too low in mass to sustain stable hydrogen fusion (the term black dwarf currently refers to a white dwarf that has cooled down so that it no longer emits significant heat or visible light). Alternative names have been proposed, including planetar and substar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Brown_Dwarf_Gliese_229B.jpg/250px-Brown_Dwarf_Gliese_229B.jpg
