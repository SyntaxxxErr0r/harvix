10.00	Genome_annotation	Genome project	Originally, most large-scale DNA sequencing centers developed their own software for assembling the sequences that they produced. However, this has changed as the software has grown more complex and as the number of sequencing centers has increased. An example of such assembler Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package developed by BGI for de novo assembly of human-sized genomes, alignment, SNP detection, resequencing, indel finding, and structural variation analysis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Hereford67-300.jpg/220px-Hereford67-300.jpg
