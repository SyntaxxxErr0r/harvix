64.8	The_Third_Place	Third place	The third place is a term used in the concept of community building to refer to social surroundings separate from the two usual social environments of home and the workplace. In his influential book The Great Good Place, Ray Oldenburg (1989, 1991) argues that third places are important for civil society, democracy, civic engagement, and establishing feelings of a sense of place.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Barbearia.jpg/300px-Barbearia.jpg
