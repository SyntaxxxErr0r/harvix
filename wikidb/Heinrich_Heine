67.6	Heinrich_Heine	Heinrich Heine	Christian Johann Heinrich Heine (13 December 1797 â€“ 17 February 1856) was one of the most significant German poets of the 19th century. He was also a journalist, essayist, and literary critic. He is best known outside Germany for his early lyric poetry, which was set to music in the form of Lieder (art songs) by composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert. Heine's later verse and prose is distinguished by its satirical wit and irony. His radical political views led to many of his works being banned by German authorities. Heine spent the last 25 years of his life as an expatriate in Paris.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Heinrich_Heine.PNG/200px-Heinrich_Heine.PNG
