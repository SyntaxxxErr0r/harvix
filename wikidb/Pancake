57.7	Pancake	Pancake	A pancake is a thin, flat, round cake prepared from a batter, and cooked on a hot griddle or frying pan. Most pancakes are quick breads, which use a quick leavening agent such as baking powder, while some use a yeast-raised or fermented batter. Typically, pancakes are cooked one side on a griddle and flipped partway through to cook the other side. Depending on the region, pancakes may be served at any time of day, with a variety of toppings or fillings including jam, chocolate chips, fruit, syrup or meat.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Neil%27s_blueberry_pancakes.jpg/220px-Neil%27s_blueberry_pancakes.jpg
