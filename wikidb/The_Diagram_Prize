2.00	The_Diagram_Prize	Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year	The Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, commonly known as the Diagram Prize for short, is a humorous literary award that is given annually to the book with the oddest title. The prize is named after the Diagram Group, an information and graphics company based in London, and The Bookseller, a British trade magazine for the publishing industry. Originally organised to provide entertainment during the 1978 Frankfurt Book Fair, the prize has since been awarded every year by The Bookseller and is now organised by the magazine's diarist Horace Bent. The winner was at first decided by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been decided by a public vote on The Bookseller's website.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/DiagramPrize.jpg/250px-DiagramPrize.jpg
