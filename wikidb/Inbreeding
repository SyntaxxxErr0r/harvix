67.1	Inbreeding	Inbreeding	Inbreeding is the reproduction from the mating of two genetically related parents. Inbreeding results in increased homozygosity, which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by recessive or deleterious traits. This generally leads to a decreased fitness of a population, which is called inbreeding depression.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Intense_inbreeding_-_Continuous_sire_to_daughter_mating.svg/220px-Intense_inbreeding_-_Continuous_sire_to_daughter_mating.svg.png
