69.5	The_Time_Machine	The Time Machine	The Time Machine is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells, published in 1895 and later adapted into two feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media. This 32,000 word story is generally credited with the popularisation of the concept of time travel using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle. This work is an early example of the Dying Earth subgenre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/Timemachinebook.JPG/200px-Timemachinebook.JPG
