65.3	Ambient_occlusion	Ambient occlusion	Ambient occlusion is a shading method used in 3D computer graphics which helps add realism to local reflection models by taking into account attenuation of light due to occlusion. Ambient occlusion attempts to approximate the way light radiates in real life, especially off what are normally considered non-reflective surfaces.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Aocclude_insectambient.jpg/200px-Aocclude_insectambient.jpg
