1.00	Triptych%2C_May%E2%80%93June_1973	Triptych, May–June 1973	Triptych, May–June 1973 is a triptych completed in 1973 by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon (1909–1992). The oil-on-canvas was painted in memory of Bacon's lover George Dyer who committed suicide on the eve of the artist's retrospective at Paris's Grand Palais, on 24 October 1971. The triptych is a portrait of the moments before Dyer's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room. Bacon was preoccupied by Dyer's loss in his last twenty years, and painted many works on the event and its aftermath. He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered from the event, and described painting the triptych as an exorcism of his feelings of loss and guilt.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Triptych_May-June%2C_1973.jpg/450px-Triptych_May-June%2C_1973.jpg
