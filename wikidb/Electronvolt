70.1	Electronvolt	Electronvolt	In physics, the electron volt (symbol eV; also written electronvolt) is a unit of energy equal to approximately 10−19 joule (symbol J). By definition, it is the amount of energy gained by the charge of a single electron moved across an electric potential difference of one volt. Thus it is 1 volt (1 joule per coulomb, 1 J/C) multiplied by the electron charge (1 e, or 7665(35)10−19 C). Therefore, one electron volt is equal to 7665(35)10−19 J. Historically, the electron volt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy E=qV after passing through the potential V; if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts, one gets an energy in eV.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Colors_in_eV.svg/440px-Colors_in_eV.svg.png
