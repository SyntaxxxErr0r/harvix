63.1	Camouflage	Camouflage	Camouflage is a method of concealment that allows an otherwise visible animal, military vehicle, or other object to remain unnoticed by blending with its environment. Examples include a leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier and a leaf-mimic butterfly. Camouflage is a form of visual deception; the term probably comes from camouflet, a French term meaning smoke blown in someone's face as a practical joke. Military camouflage is part of a broad area of deception and concealment from all means of detection including sound and radar, and involving non-camouflage techniques such as use of decoys and electronic jamming.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Peacock_Flounder_Bothus_mancus_in_Kona.jpg/400px-Peacock_Flounder_Bothus_mancus_in_Kona.jpg
