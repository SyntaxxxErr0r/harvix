20.76	B%C3%A1nh_x%C3%A8o	Bánh xèo	Bánh xèo (literally "sizzling cake") are Vietnamese savoury fried pancakes made of rice flour, water, turmeric powder, stuffed with slivers of fatty pork, shrimp, diced green onion, and bean sprouts. Southern-styled banh xeo contains coconut milk and certain Central region skips the turmeric powder altogether. They are served wrapped in mustard leaf, lettuce leaves or rice paper, and stuffed with mint leaves, basil, fish leaf and/or other herbs, and dipped in a sweet and sour diluted fish sauce. In the Central region, the pancake is also dipped in a special sauce which consists of fermented soy bean and sticky rice sauce, ground pork liver, ground and toasted peanut and seasonings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/B%C3%A1nh_x%C3%A8o_1.jpg/230px-B%C3%A1nh_x%C3%A8o_1.jpg
