60.5	Gilgamesh	Gilgamesh	In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh is credited with the building of the legendary walls of Uruk. An alternative version has Gilgamesh telling Urshanabi, the ferryman, that the city's walls were built by the Seven Sages. In historical times, Sargon of Akkad claimed to have destroyed these walls to prove his military power.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Statue_of_Gilgamesh%2C_U.Sydney.jpg/170px-Statue_of_Gilgamesh%2C_U.Sydney.jpg
