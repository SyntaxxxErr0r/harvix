61.0	Canonization	Canonization	Canonization (or canonisation) is the act by which a Christian church declares a deceased person to be a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, individuals were recognized as saints without any formal process. The process is most commonly used in, although not limited to, the Catholic Church.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Stcyprian.jpg
