1.00	King_for_a_Day_(Jamiroquai_song)	King for a Day (Jamiroquai song)	"King For A Day" is the fourth and final single from British Acid Jazz band Jamiroquai's fourth studio album, Synkronized. The song was written by Jay Kay. The song is a "tribute" to bassist Stuart Zender, who left the band shortly before Synkronized was completed. Jay Kay subsequently rerecorded all the songs on the album without Zender, and added "King For A Day" as the final track on the album. The song reached #20 on the UK Singles Chart. The single is renowned for being the first Jamiroquai single not only to include a remix of a non-single, but to include an enhanced element as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Jamiroquai-King-For-A-Day-324124.jpg/220px-Jamiroquai-King-For-A-Day-324124.jpg
