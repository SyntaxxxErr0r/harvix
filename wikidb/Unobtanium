16.57	Unobtanium	Unobtainium	In engineering, fiction, and thought experiments, unobtainium (also spelled unobtanium) is any extremely rare, costly, or impossible material, or (less commonly) device needed to fulfill a given design for a given application. The properties of any particular unobtainium depend on the intended use. For example, a pulley made of unobtainium might be massless and frictionless; however, if used in a nuclear rocket, unobtainium would be light, strong at high temperatures, and resistant to radiation damage. The concept of unobtainium is often applied flippantly or humorously.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Unobtainium.PNG/220px-Unobtainium.PNG
