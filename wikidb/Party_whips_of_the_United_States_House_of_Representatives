The U.S. House of Representatives does not officially use the term "Minority Leader" although the media frequently does. The House instead uses the terms "Republican Leader" or "Democratic Leader" depending on which party holds a minority of seats.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Eric_Cantor%2C_official_portrait%2C_112th_Congress.jpg/165px-Eric_Cantor%2C_official_portrait%2C_112th_Congress.jpg
