Of this period, he served almost eleven years (1 January 1966–4 December 1976) as president (president for life in 1972–1976), and for almost three years he reigned as emperor (4 December 1976—20 September 1979). Although Bokassa was formally crowned in December 1977, his imperial title did not achieve worldwide diplomatic recognition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Central_african_republic_sm04.png/220px-Central_african_republic_sm04.png
