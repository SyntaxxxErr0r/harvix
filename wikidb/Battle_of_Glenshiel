1.00	Battle_of_Glenshiel	Battle of Glen Shiel	The Battle of Glen Shiel was a battle in Glen Shiel, in the West Highlands of Scotland on 10 June 1719, between British government troops and an alliance of Jacobites and Spaniards, resulting in a victory for the government forces. It was the last close engagement of British and foreign troops on mainland Great Britain. The Battle of Glen Shiel is sometimes considered an extension of the 1715 rising, but is more correctly a separate rebellion and was the only rising to be extinguished by a single military action. It is sometimes known as the Nineteen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Glen_shiel.jpg/300px-Glen_shiel.jpg
