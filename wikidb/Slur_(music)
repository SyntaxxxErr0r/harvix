15.61	Slur_(music)	Slur (music)	A slur is a symbol in Western musical notation indicating that the notes it embraces are to be played without separation. This implies legato articulation, and in music for bowed string instruments, it also indicates the notes should be played in one bow; and in music for wind instruments, that the notes should be played without using the tongue to rearticulate each note (see tonguing). In guitar music, the slur indicates that the notes should be played without plucking the individual strings, i.e. hammer-ons and pull-offs. In vocal music, slurs are usually used to mark notes which are sung to a single syllable (see: melisma).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/G_run_in_G.png/300px-G_run_in_G.png
