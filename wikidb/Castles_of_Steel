1.00	Castles_of_Steel	Castles of Steel	Castles of Steel is a work of non-fiction by Pulitzer Prize-winner Robert K. Massie. It details the naval actions of the First World War with an emphasis on those of the United Kingdom and Imperial Germany. This book continues the examination of the naval arms race between these two powers in Massie's tome Dreadnought: Britain, Germany, and the coming of the Great War. The term "castles of steel" was coined by the British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill in reference to the large number of the Royal Navy's battleships he saw in review at Spithead in 1914.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ad/Castles_of_Steel_Cover1.jpg/200px-Castles_of_Steel_Cover1.jpg
