75.4	RAW_(magazine)	RAW (magazine)	RAW was a comics anthology edited by Art Spiegelman and Fran√ßoise Mouly and published by Mouly from 1980 to 1991. It was a flagship publication of the 1980s alternative comics movement, serving as a more intellectual counterpoint to Robert Crumb's visceral Weirdo, which followed squarely in the underground tradition of Zap and Arcade. Along with the more genre-oriented Heavy Metal it was also one of the main venues for European comics in the United States in its day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Raw01.jpg/250px-Raw01.jpg
