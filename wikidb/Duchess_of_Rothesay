1.00	Duchess_of_Rothesay	Duchess of Rothesay	Duchess of Rothesay is a Scottish courtesy title. It is held by the wife of the Dukes of Rothesay since the first Duke in 1398. Due to the mortality rate and the fact that very few Dukes of Rothesay were of majority or married prior to ascending the throne (if that), there have in fact been only eight Duchesses of Rothesay. A separate Scottish throne has not existed de facto since 1603 when James VI of Scotland acceded to the throne of England when the House of Tudor died out, creating a personal union. The Act of Union of 1707 united de jure the separate kingdoms and thrones into the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Duchess of Rothesay is the Scottish equivalent of the Duchess of Cornwall. Ever since 1603 the title of The Duchess of Rothesay is held by The Princess of Wales, who was also the Duchess of Cornwall, the title of Duchess of Rothesay is for her use when in Scotland.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Princess_diana_bristol_1987_01.jpg/200px-Princess_diana_bristol_1987_01.jpg
