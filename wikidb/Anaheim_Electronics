10.21	Anaheim_Electronics	Anaheim Electronics	Anaheim Electronics is a fictional civilian company that appeared in the Universal Century timeline of the Gundam anime metaseries. The company appeared first in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam(aired in 1985) as the main financier, supplier, and manufacturer of the faction AEUG. However, the company also builds weapons for both the Earth Federation, its elite faction Titans, enemy of the AEUG, and the Axis Zeon, which in turn became the enemies of the AEUG until the end of the sequel, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ(aired in 1986). The company continues its manufacturing contracts in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ and Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack(aired in 1988), where its weapons are always seen in both sides of the conflicting factions. In the novel Gundam Sentinel, which happens between the conflicts of the anime series Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and Mobile suit Gundam ZZ, Anaheim Electronics became the main contractor of the Earth Federation of its new mass-production units like Nero and the Z Plus series for the Task Force alpha and also provided prototype units such as S Gundam as a testbed for the Federation. The Gundam Sentinel's Model Graphix special edition, Gundam Wars III, the battle of real Gundam in turn gave a detail analysis of the company and retconned the production and testing history. The company's earlier history was then told in the anime Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory(OVA first released in 1991), where it first became the contract manufacturer of the Earth Federation. In December 2003, celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Gundam metaseries, a book Anaheim Journal was released, disguised as a monthly magazine published by Anaheim Electronics in UC0100. The company also appeared in the comic Silhouette Formula 91, and later in the anime Mobile Suit V Gundam.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/AE_logo.JPG
