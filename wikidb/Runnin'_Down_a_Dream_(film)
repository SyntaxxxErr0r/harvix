The 4-hour documentary chronicles the history of the band, from its inception as Mudcrutch, right up to the 30th anniversary concert in Petty's home town of Gainesville, Florida. The movie features interviews with George Harrison, Eddie Vedder, Stevie Nicks, Dave Grohl, Jeff Lynne, Rick Rubin, Johnny Depp, Jackson Browne and more. Petty's solo career is also touched on, as is his time with The Traveling Wilburys. The film was commercially released as part of a four disc boxset. The film was spread over the first two discs, while the 30th anniversary concert and a CD of rare tracks were the components of the remaining two discs. On October 28, 2008, a two disc set of the film, featuring previously unreleased bonus performances, but not the Gainesville concert or audio CD, was released to the public. According to the promotional video for the upcoming Deluxe Edition release of Damn The Torpedoes (being released November 9, 2010 on 1CD, 2CD, Blu-ray and 180g Vinyl editions) Runnin' Down A Dream will be released on Blu-ray Disc exclusively through Amazon on November 15.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6f/Runninhomepage.jpg/220px-Runninhomepage.jpg
