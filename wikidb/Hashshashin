58.7	Hashshashin	Assassins	The Assassins were an order of Nizari Ismailis, particularly those of Persia (and Syria) that existed from around 1092 to 1275. Posing a strong military threat to Sunni Saljuq authority within the Persian territories, the Nizari Ismailis captured and inhabited many mountain fortresses under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah. The modern word 'assassin' is derived from their name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Ismail_lion_7.png/170px-Ismail_lion_7.png
