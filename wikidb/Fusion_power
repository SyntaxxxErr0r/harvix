78.7	Fusion_power	Fusion power	Fusion power is the power generated by nuclear fusion processes. In fusion reactions two light atomic nuclei fuse together to form a heavier nucleus (in contrast with fission power). In doing so they release a comparatively large amount of energy arising from the binding energy due to the strong nuclear force which is manifested as an increase in temperature of the reactants. Fusion power is a primary area of research in plasma physics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Sun_in_X-Ray.png/300px-Sun_in_X-Ray.png
