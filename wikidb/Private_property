57.5	Private_property	Private property	Private property is the ownership, control, employment, ability to dispose of, and bequeath land, capital, and other forms of property by persons and privately-owned firms. Private property is distinguishable from public property and collective property, which refers to assets owned by a state, community or government rather than by individuals or a business entity. Private property emerged as the dominant form of property in the means of production and land during the Industrial Revolution in the early 18th century, displacing feudal property, guilds, cottage industry and craft production, which were based on ownership of the tools for production by individual laborers or guilds of craftspeople.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Wolfsburg_VW-Werk.jpg/250px-Wolfsburg_VW-Werk.jpg
