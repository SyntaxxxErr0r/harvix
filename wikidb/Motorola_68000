63.7	Motorola_68000	Motorola 68000	The Motorola 68000 is a 16/32-bit CISC microprocessor core designed and marketed by Freescale Semiconductor (formerly Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 30 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/XC68000.agr.jpg/250px-XC68000.agr.jpg
