58.1	Thelema	Thelema	Thelema is a spiritual philosophy (referred to by some as a religion) that was developed by the early 20th century British writer and ceremonial magician, Aleister Crowley. He came to believe himself to be the prophet of a new age, the Ã†on of Horus, based upon a spiritual experience that he and his wife, Rose Edith, had in Egypt in 1904. By his account, a possibly non-corporeal or "praeterhuman" being that called itself Aiwass contacted him and dictated a text known as The Book of the Law or Liber AL vel Legis, which outlined the principles of Thelema.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Crowley_unicursal_hexagram.svg/220px-Crowley_unicursal_hexagram.svg.png
