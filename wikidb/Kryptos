57.4	Kryptos	Kryptos	Kryptos is an encrypted sculpture by American artist Jim Sanborn located on the grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley, Virginia. Since its dedication on November 3, 1990, there has been much speculation about the meaning of the encrypted messages it bears. Of the four messages, three have been solved, with the fourth remaining one of the most famous unsolved codes in the world. The sculpture continues to provide a diversion for cryptanalysts, both amateur and professional, who are attempting to decrypt the final section.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Kryptos01_1.jpg/300px-Kryptos01_1.jpg
