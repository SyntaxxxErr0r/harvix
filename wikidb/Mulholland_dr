The surrealist film was highly acclaimed by many critics and earned Lynch the Prix de la mise en sc√®ne (Best Director Award) at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival as well as an Oscar nomination for Best Director. Mulholland Drive launched the careers of Watts and Harring and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress Ann Miller. The film is widely regarded as one of Lynch's finest works, alongside Eraserhead (1977) and Blue Velvet (1986), and has been chosen by many critics as representing a significant perspective of the 2000s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Mulholland.png/220px-Mulholland.png
