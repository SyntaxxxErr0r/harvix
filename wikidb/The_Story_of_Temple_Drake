Though watered down, the movie was still so scandalous, it was one of reasons for the introduction of the Hays Code. It starred Miriam Hopkins as a wild Southern woman who falls into the hands of a gang led by the brutal Trigger, played by Jack La Rue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/Templedrake.jpg/220px-Templedrake.jpg
