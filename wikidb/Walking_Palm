1.00	Walking_Palm	Socratea exorrhiza	Socratea exorrhiza, the Walking Palm or Cashapona, is a palm native to rainforests in tropical Central and South America. It can grow to 25 meters in height, with a stem diameter of up to 16 cm, but is more typically 15-20 m tall and 12 cm in diameter. It has unusual stilt roots, the function of which has been debated. Many species of epiphyte have been found growing on the palms. The palm is pollinated by beetles, and various organisms eat its seeds or seedlings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Socratea_exorrhiza.jpg/220px-Socratea_exorrhiza.jpg
