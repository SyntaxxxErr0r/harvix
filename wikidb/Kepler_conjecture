30.21	Kepler_conjecture	Kepler conjecture	The Kepler conjecture, named after the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler, is a mathematical conjecture about sphere packing in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It says that no arrangement of equally sized spheres filling space has a greater average density than that of the cubic close packing and hexagonal close packing arrangements. The density of these arrangements is slightly greater than 74%.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Pyramid_of_35_spheres_animation.gif
