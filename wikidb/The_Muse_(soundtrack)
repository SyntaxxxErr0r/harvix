1.10	The_Muse_(soundtrack)	The Muse (soundtrack)	The Muse is a soundtrack released by singer Elton John in August 1999 for the original motion picture The Muse. The album is a departure for Elton, as it is mainly the orchestrated score of the film, which he wrote in its entirety. The only vocal track is the title track, which was co-written with longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3f/The_Muse_EJ_Album.jpg/220px-The_Muse_EJ_Album.jpg
