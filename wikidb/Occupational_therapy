80.7	Occupational_therapy	Occupational therapy	Occupational therapy is a discipline that aims to promote health by enabling people to perform meaningful and purposeful activities. Occupational therapists work with individuals who suffer from a mentally, physically, developmentally, and/or emotionally disabling condition by utilizing treatments that develop, recover, or maintain clients' activities of daily living. The therapist helps clients not only to improve their basic motor functions and reasoning abilities, but also to compensate for permanent loss of function. The goal of occupational therapy is to help clients have independent, productive, and satisfying lives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Occupational_therapy_psychiatric_hospital.jpg/300px-Occupational_therapy_psychiatric_hospital.jpg
