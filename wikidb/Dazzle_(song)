2.10	Dazzle_(song)	Dazzle (song)	"Dazzle" is the second single from the 1984 Siouxsie and the Banshees album Hy√¶na. The song begins with a gradual fade-in of an orchestral strings section and progresses to a drum-driven, majestic anthem. The lyrics "swallowing diamonds/a cutting throat" came after watching the final scene of Marathon Man where Laurence Olivier puts diamonds in his mouth. Sioux's vocals are accentuated by expansive reverb effects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Siouxsie_Dazzle.jpg/220px-Siouxsie_Dazzle.jpg
