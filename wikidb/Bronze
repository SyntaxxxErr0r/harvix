108.1	Bronze	Bronze	Bronze is a metal alloy consisting primarily of copper, usually with tin as the main additive. It is hard and brittle, and it was particularly significant in antiquity, so much so that the Bronze Age was named after the metal. However, since "bronze" is a somewhat imprecise term, and historical pieces have variable compositions, in particular with an unclear boundary with brass, modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the more cautious and inclusive term "copper alloy" instead.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/NatarajaMET.JPG/300px-NatarajaMET.JPG
