73.4	Weight_training	Weight training	Weight training is a common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles. It uses the weight force of gravity (in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks) to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction. Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/TwoDumbbells.JPG/250px-TwoDumbbells.JPG
