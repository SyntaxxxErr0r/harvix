98.1	Corporatism	Corporatism	Corporatism, also known as corporativism, is a system of economic, political, or social organization that involves association of the people of society into corporate groups, such as agricultural, business, ethnic, labor, military, patronage, or scientific affiliations, on the basis of common interests. Corporatism is theoretically based upon the interpretation of a community as an organic body. The term corporatism is based on the Latin root "corp" meaning "body".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/PaulT.jpg/250px-PaulT.jpg
