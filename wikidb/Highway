59.3	Highway	Highway	A highway is any public road. In American English, the term is common and almost always designates major roads. In British English, the term (which is not particularly common) designates any road open to the public. Any interconnected set of highways can be variously referred to as a "highway system", a "highway network", or a "highway transportation system". Each country has its own national highway system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Blick_auf_A_2_bei_Rastst%C3%A4tte_Lehrter_See_%282009%29.jpg/220px-Blick_auf_A_2_bei_Rastst%C3%A4tte_Lehrter_See_%282009%29.jpg
