63.8	Gerard_Manley_Hopkins	Gerard Manley Hopkins	Gerard Manley Hopkins, S.J. (28 July 1844 â€“ 8 June 1889) was an English poet, Roman Catholic convert, and Jesuit priest, whose posthumous fame established him among the leading Victorian poets. His experimental explorations in prosody (especially sprung rhythm) and his use of imagery established him as a daring innovator in a period of largely traditional verse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/GerardManleyHopkins.jpg/220px-GerardManleyHopkins.jpg
