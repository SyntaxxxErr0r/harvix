108.6	Bridge	Bridge	A bridge is a structure built to span physical obstacles such as a body of water, valley, or road, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed, the material used to make it and the funds available to build it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Akashi-kaikyo_bridge3.jpg/337px-Akashi-kaikyo_bridge3.jpg
