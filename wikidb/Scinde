This river was known to the ancient Iranians in Avestan as Harauhuti, in Sanskrit as Sarasvati, to Assyrians (as early as the seventh century BC) as Sinda, to the Greeks as Indos, to the Romans as Indus, to the Persians as Ab-e-sind, to the Pashtuns as "Abasind", to the Arabs as Al-Sind, to the Chinese as Sintow, and to the Javanese as the Santri.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Flag_of_Sindh.PNG/100px-Flag_of_Sindh.PNG
