123.2	IPv4_address_exhaustion	IPv4 address exhaustion	On 31 January 2011, the last two unreserved IANA /8 address blocks were allocated to APNIC according to RIR request procedures. This left five reserved but unallocated /8 blocks. In accord with ICANN policies, IANA proceeded to allocate one of those five /8s to each RIR, exhausting the IANA pool, at a ceremony and press conference on 3 February 2011.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Ipv4-exhaust.svg/220px-Ipv4-exhaust.svg.png
