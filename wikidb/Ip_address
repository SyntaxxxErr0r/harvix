An IP address serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. Its role has been characterized as follows: "A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ipv4_address.svg/300px-Ipv4_address.svg.png
