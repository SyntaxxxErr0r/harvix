3.01	Sasakawa_Ryoichi	Ryoichi Sasakawa	Ryoichi Sasakawa Sasakawa Ryōichi, May 4, 1899 – July 18, 1995) was a Japanese businessman, politician and philanthropist born in Minoh, Osaka. He was accused but acquitted of being a Class A war criminal after World War II, was a self-proclaimed fascist, kuromaku (political power-broker), and the founder of The Nippon Foundation. While he is widely known throughout Africa and much of the developing world for the wide-ranging philanthropic programs that he established, he is at the same time viewed with hostility by many intellectuals for his right wing ideals and ties to Japan's motorboat racing industry and support for the Unification Movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/RyoichiSasakawa_face.jpg/220px-RyoichiSasakawa_face.jpg
