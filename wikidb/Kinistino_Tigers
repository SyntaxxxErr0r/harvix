1.00	Kinistino_Tigers	Kinistino Tigers	The Kinistino Jr. Tigers were a team in the North Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (NSJHL) from 1970-1997. Originally called the Kinistino Tiger-Bruins, the team was renamed to the Tigers following the 1983-1984 season. The Tigers played out of the Kinistino Sports Complex in Kinistino, Saskatchewan for the duration of the teams existence. The team folded after the 1996-1997 season due to the inability to attract young players to play in the small town.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/KinistinoTiger.jpg/200px-KinistinoTiger.jpg
