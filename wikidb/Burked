1.10	Burked	Asphyxia	Asphyxia or asphyxiation (from Greek α- "without" and σφύξις sphyxis, "heartbeat") is a condition of severely deficient supply of oxygen to the body that arises from being unable to breathe normally. An example of asphyxia is choking. Asphyxia causes generalized hypoxia, which primarily affects the tissues and organs. It can be caused by improper ventilation and charcoal burning in a closed room. Many incidents have been reported (death and coma).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Image943-knee_mount.jpg/250px-Image943-knee_mount.jpg
