If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing his or her strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitute a Nash equilibrium. The practical and general implication is that when players also act in the interests of the group, then they are better off than if they acted in their individual interests alone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Nash_graph_equilibrium.png
