94.1	Melanoma	Melanoma	Melanoma (from Greek μέλας — melas, "dark") is a malignant tumor of melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells that produce the dark pigment, melanin, which is responsible for the color of skin. They predominantly occur in skin, but are also found in other parts of the body, including the bowel and the eye (see uveal melanoma). Melanoma can originate in any part of the body that contains melanocytes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Melanoma.jpg/225px-Melanoma.jpg
