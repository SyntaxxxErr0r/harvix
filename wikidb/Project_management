182.4	Project_management	Project management	Project management has been practiced since early civilization. Until 1900 civil engineering projects were generally managed by creative architects, engineers, and master builders themselves, for example Vitruvius (first century BC), Christopher Wren (1632–1723), Thomas Telford (1757–1834) and Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806–1859). It was in the 1950s that organizations started to systematically apply project management tools and techniques to complex engineering projects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Trajan%27s_Column_%28Roman_Soldiers_Building_a_Fortress%29.png/280px-Trajan%27s_Column_%28Roman_Soldiers_Building_a_Fortress%29.png
