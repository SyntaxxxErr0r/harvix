8.11	Vancouver_School	Vancouver School	Jeff Wall's Mimic (1982) typifies his cinematographic style. A large colour transparency, it depicts a white couple and an Asian man walking towards the camera. The sidewalk, flanked by parked cars and residential and light-industrial buildings, suggests a North American industrial suburb. The woman is wearing red shorts and a white top displaying her midriff; her bearded, unkempt boyfriend wears a denim vest. The Asian man is casual but well-dressed in comparison, in a collared shirt and slacks. As the couple overtake the man, the boyfriend makes an ambiguous but apparently obscene and racist gesture, holding his upraised middle finger close to the corner of his eye, "slanting" his eye in mockery of the Asian man's eyes. The picture resembles a candid shot that captures the moment and its implicit social tensions, but is actually a recreation of an exchange witnessed by the artist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Jeff_Wall_Mimic.jpg/200px-Jeff_Wall_Mimic.jpg
