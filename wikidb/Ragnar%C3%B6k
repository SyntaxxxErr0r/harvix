72.4	Ragnar%C3%B6k	Ragnarök	In Norse mythology, Ragnarök — typically spelled Ragnarǫk in the handwritten scripts — is a series of future events, including a great battle foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and reborn gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors. Ragnarök is an important event in the Norse canon, and has been the subject of scholarly discourse and theory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Urnes_animals.jpg/220px-Urnes_animals.jpg
