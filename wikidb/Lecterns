1.00	Lecterns	Lectern	A lectern (from the Latin lectus, past participle of legere, "to read") is a reading desk with a slanted top, usually placed on a stand or affixed to some other form of support, on which documents or books are placed as support for reading aloud, as in a scripture reading, lecture, or sermon. To facilitate eye-contact and improve posture when facing an audience, lecterns may have adjustable height and slant. People generally use lecterns while standing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Seattle_First_Methodist_14.jpg/180px-Seattle_First_Methodist_14.jpg
