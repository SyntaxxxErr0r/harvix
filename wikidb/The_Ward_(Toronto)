4.10	The_Ward_(Toronto)	The Ward, Toronto	The Ward (formally St. John's Ward) was a neighbourhood in central Toronto bound by College Street, Queen Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue and was centred on the intersection of Terauley (now Bay Street) and Albert Street. For several decades of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, a highly dense slum where successive waves of new immigrants would initially settle before establishing themselves. In the nineteenth century it was the home of refugees from the European Revolutions of 1848, the Irish Potato Famine, the Underground Railroad, and then refugees from Russia and Eastern Europe. It was the centre of the city's Jewish community from the late nineteenth century until the 1920s when the Jewish community moved west to Spadina Avenue and Kensington Market and was also the home of the city's original Chinatown until the late 1950s and of the city's Italian community until it moved west along College Street to Little Italy. The city's Polish, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, and numerous other non-Anglo-Saxon immigrants first established themselves in "The Ward".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Butcher_sign_in_the_Ward.jpg/200px-Butcher_sign_in_the_Ward.jpg
