Bell Road is one of the few roadways to cross the Agua Fria River in the northern part of the metro area, providing a vital link between the growing suburb of Surprise with Phoenix. As a result, the portion of Bell Road passing through Surprise and Sun City is the busiest arterial road in the state of Arizona.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Camelback_Mountain_2.jpg/220px-Camelback_Mountain_2.jpg
