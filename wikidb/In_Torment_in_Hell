1.10	In_Torment_in_Hell	In Torment in Hell	In Torment in Hell is the sixth studio album by the American death metal band Deicide. The album receives strong criticism from the metal underground for what many critics view as rushed production and lackluster songwriting. There were even rumors circulating around the internet that the band had simply done a bad record in order to get kicked off their label, Roadrunner Records, however there is no proof of this. Along with the label pressuring them for a quick follow-up to Insineratehymn, Deicide failed to meet the deadline of its original release date July 31. The band rarely plays any songs from this album live.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Deicide_InTormentInHell.jpg
