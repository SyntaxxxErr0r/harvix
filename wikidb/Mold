73.5	Mold	Mold	Molds (or moulds; see spelling differences) are fungi that grow in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae. A connected network of these tubular branching hyphae has multiple, genetically identical nuclei and is considered a single organism, referred to as a colony. In contrast, fungi that grow as single cells are called yeasts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/DecayingPeachSmall.gif
