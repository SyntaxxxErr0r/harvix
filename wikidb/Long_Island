72.0	Long_Island	Long Island	Long Island is an island located in the southeast part of the U.S. state of New York, just east of Manhattan. Stretching northeast into the Atlantic Ocean, Long Island contains four counties, two of which are boroughs of New York City , and two of which are mainly suburban (Nassau and Suffolk). The term "Long Island" often refers only to Nassau and Suffolk counties in order to differentiate them from New York City, though all four counties on the island are part of the New York metropolitan area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Long_Island_US_map.gif/250px-Long_Island_US_map.gif
