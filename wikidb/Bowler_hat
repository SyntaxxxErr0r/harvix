The bowler hat was popular with the working class during the Victorian era though it came to form the official work uniform of bankers. Later in the United Kingdom, it would come to be worn as work dress by the officers of the Queen's Guards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/PaulStrandBowlerHat.jpg/175px-PaulStrandBowlerHat.jpg
