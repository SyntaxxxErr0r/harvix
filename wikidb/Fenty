2.00	Fenty	Adrian Fenty	Adrian Malik Fenty (born December 6, 1970) was the sixth, and at age 36, the youngest, mayor of the District of Columbia. He served one term—from 2007 to 2011—losing his bid for reelection at the primary level to Democrat Vincent C. Gray. Though Fenty won the Republican mayoral primary as a write-in candidate, he declined the Republican nomination and said he would likely not seek elected office again. Gray went on to win the general election for Mayor in the largely Democratic District.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Adrian_Fenty%2C_Mayor_of_DC%2C_November_5%2C_2007.jpg/220px-Adrian_Fenty%2C_Mayor_of_DC%2C_November_5%2C_2007.jpg
