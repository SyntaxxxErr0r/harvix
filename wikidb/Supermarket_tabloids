2.20	Supermarket_tabloids	Tabloid journalism	Tabloid journalism tends to emphasize topics such as sensational crime stories, astrology, gossip columns about the personal lives of celebrities and sports stars, and junk food news. Such journalism is commonly associated with tabloid sized newspapers like "The National Enquirer", "Globe" or "The Daily Mail" and the former "News of the World." The terms "tabloids", "supermarket tabloids", "gutter press", and "rag", refer to the journalistic approach of such newspapers rather than their size.
