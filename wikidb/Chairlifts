1.00	Chairlifts	Chairlift	An elevated passenger ropeway, or chairlift, is a type of aerial lift, which consists of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers, carrying a series of chairs. They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas (in such cases referred to as 'skilifts'), but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions—and increasingly—in urban transport.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Hunter4.jpg/220px-Hunter4.jpg
