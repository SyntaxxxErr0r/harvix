79.6	Australian	Australians	Australian people, or simply Australians, are the citizens of Australia. Australia is a multi-ethnic nation, and therefore the term "Australian" is not a racial identifier. Aside from the Indigenous Australian population, nearly all Australians or their ancestors immigrated within the past 230 years. Colloquial names used to refer to Australians include Aussies, and Antipodeans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/110px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png
