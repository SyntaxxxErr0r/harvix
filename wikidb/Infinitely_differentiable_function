1.01	Infinitely_differentiable_function	Smooth function	In mathematical analysis, a differentiability class is a classification of functions according to the properties of their derivatives. Higher order differentiability classes correspond to the existence of more derivatives. Functions that have derivatives of all orders are called smooth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Bump2D_illustration.png/250px-Bump2D_illustration.png
