251.0	Network_effect	Network effect	In economics and business, a network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the effect that one user of a good or service has on the value of that product to other people. When network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Network_effect.png
