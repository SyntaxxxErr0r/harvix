51.4	Canadian_Shield	Canadian Shield	The Canadian Shield, also called the Laurentian Plateau, or Bouclier Canadien (French), is a vast geological shield covered by a thin layer of soil that forms the nucleus of the North American or Laurentia craton. It is an area mostly composed of igneous rock which relates to its long volcanic history. It has a deep, common, joined bedrock region in Eastern and central Canada and stretches North from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, covering over half of Canada; it also extends South into the Northern reaches of the United States. Human population is scarce, and industrial development is minimal, while mining is very prevalent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Canada_geological_map.JPG/220px-Canada_geological_map.JPG
