In some cases these vanes can be variable length and/or tensioned to maintain contact with the walls as the pump rotates. It was invented by Charles C. Barnes of Sackville, New Brunswick who patented it on June 16, 1874.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Rotary_vane_pump.svg/300px-Rotary_vane_pump.svg.png
