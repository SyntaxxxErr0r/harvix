80.1	Dumpster_diving	Dumpster diving	Dumpster diving (known as skipping in the UK) is the practice of sifting through commercial or residential trash to find items that have been discarded by their owners, but that may prove useful to the dumpster diver. Dumpster Diving is also viewed as an effective urban foraging technique. Dumpster divers will forage dumpsters for items such as clothing, furniture, food, and other items of the like deemed in good working conditions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Recycling_symbol.svg/120px-Recycling_symbol.svg.png
