8.11	%E2%98%A7	Chi Rho	The Chi Rho is one of the earliest forms of christogram, and is used by Christians. It is formed by superimposing the first two (capital) letters chi and rho of the Greek word "ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ" =Christ in such a way to produce the monogram. Although not technically a Christian cross, the Chi-Rho invokes the crucifixion of Jesus, as well as symbolizing his status as the Christ.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Simple_Labarum2.svg/150px-Simple_Labarum2.svg.png
