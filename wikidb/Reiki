135.3	Reiki	Reiki	Reiki , English pronunciation: ) is a spiritual practice developed in 1922 by Japanese Buddhist Mikao Usui, which since has been adapted by various teachers of varying traditions. It uses a technique commonly called palm healing or hands on healing as a form of complementary therapy and is sometimes classified as oriental medicine by some professional medical bodies. Through the use of this technique, practitioners believe that they are transferring universal energy (i.e., reiki) in the form of ki through the palms, which allows for self-healing and a state of equilibrium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Mikaousui.jpg/100px-Mikaousui.jpg
