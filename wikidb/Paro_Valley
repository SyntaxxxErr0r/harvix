2.00	Paro_Valley	Paro District	Paro District is the name of a district (dzongkhag), valley, river and town (population 20,000) in Bhutan. It is one of the most historic valleys in Bhutan. Both trade goods and invading Tibetans came over the pass at the head of the valley, giving Paro the closest cultural connection with Tibet of any Bhutanese district. The dominant language in Paro is Dzongkha, the national language.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Paro_Bhutan_location_map.png/300px-Paro_Bhutan_location_map.png
