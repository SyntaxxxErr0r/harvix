The sculptures depict standing male lions with a sphere under one claw, looking to the side. The Medici lions have also been copied, or strongly inspired new sculptures, in many other locations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Lion_of_Loggia_de%27_Lanzi_left.JPG/220px-Lion_of_Loggia_de%27_Lanzi_left.JPG
