95.8	Carbon_monoxide	Carbon monoxide	Carbon monoxide (CO), also called carbonous oxide, is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly lighter than air. It can be toxic to humans and animals when encountered in higher concentrations, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere however, it is short lived and spatially variable, since it combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and ozone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Carbon_monoxide_2D.svg/100px-Carbon_monoxide_2D.svg.png
