"bubble economy") was an economic bubble in Japan from 1986 to 1991, in which real estate and stock prices were greatly inflated. The bubble's subsequent collapse lasted for more than a decade with stock prices initially bottoming in 2003, although they would descend even further amidst the global crisis in 2008. The Japanese asset price bubble contributed to what some refer to as the Lost Decade. Some economists, such as Paul Krugman, have argued that Japan fell into a liquidity trap during these years.
