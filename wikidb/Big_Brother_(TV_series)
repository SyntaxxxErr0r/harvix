93.5	Big_Brother_(TV_series)	Big Brother (TV series)	Big Brother is a television franchise where a group of people live together in a large house, isolated from the outside world. They are continuously watched by television cameras. Each series lasts for around three months, with 12-14 contestants entering the house. In order to win the final cash prize, all the contestants have to do is survive periodic evictions and be the last one standing. The idea for Big Brother is said to have come during a brainstorm session at the Dutch production house of John de Mol Produkties (an independent part of Endemol) on 4 September 1997. The first version of Big Brother broadcast was in the Netherlands in 1999 on the Veronica TV channel, and since then many countries have purchased the franchise and added their own adaptions to the show. Today the series is produced by Miller-Boyett productions, in association with Lorimar television distribution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Big_brother_countries.PNG/220px-Big_brother_countries.PNG
