2.20	Sylvain_Houde	Sylvain Houde	Sylvain Houde was the singer and lyricist of the Canadian death metal band Kataklysm. He was the band's original singer and left after three albums to form a band of his own, which apparently never surfaced. He is known for his very deep and fast death grunt which he combined with higher pitched, shrieking grunts.
