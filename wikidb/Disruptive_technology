353.4	Disruptive_technology	Disruptive innovation	A disruptive innovation is an innovation that helps create a new market and value network, and eventually goes on to disrupt an existing market and value network (over a few years or decades), displacing an earlier technology. The term is used in business and technology literature to describe innovations that improve a product or service in ways that the market does not expect, typically first by designing for a different set of consumers in the new market and later by lowering prices in the existing market.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Disruptivetechnology.gif/450px-Disruptivetechnology.gif
