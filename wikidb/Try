29.72	Try	Try	A try is the major way of scoring points in rugby league and rugby union football. A try is scored by grounding the ball in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area (see next section).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Shaun_Perry_rugby_try.jpg/250px-Shaun_Perry_rugby_try.jpg
