According to the notes which accompany the first Aliens versus Predator graphic novel, the original idea of combining the Aliens with Predators was the result of a brain-storming session between the comic's creators (AVP artist and editor Chris Warner is specifically credited) in the late 1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/Alien_vs._predatorcomic.jpg
