52.7	Dragonlance	Dragonlance	Dragonlance is a shared universe created by Laura and Tracy Hickman, and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis under the direction of TSR, Inc. into a series of popular fantasy novels. The Hickmans conceived Dragonlance while driving in their car on the way to TSR for a job application. At TSR, Tracy met Margaret Weis, his future writing partner, and they gathered a group of associates to play the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game. The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules, a series of novels, licensed products such as board games, and lead miniature figures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/59/Dragonlance-Logo-Orig.png/250px-Dragonlance-Logo-Orig.png
