1.11	Harescombe	Harescombe	Harescombe is a small village in Gloucestershire, England. It is situated five miles south of Gloucester. It is thought the name of the village is derived from a combination of the Celtic term "cwm" (valley) and the Saxon term "here" (army), thus the full meaning of "Harescombe" would be "the Army's Valley".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Harescombe_Church.jpg/240px-Harescombe_Church.jpg
