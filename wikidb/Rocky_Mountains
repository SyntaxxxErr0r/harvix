115.0	Rocky_Mountains	Rocky Mountains	The Rocky Mountains (or the Rockies) are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than 3,000 miles (4,830 km) from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Moraine_Lake_17092005.jpg/275px-Moraine_Lake_17092005.jpg
