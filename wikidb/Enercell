4.00	Enercell	Enercell	Enercell is a battery brand sold exclusively by RadioShack at retail stores and online. For decades, Enercell batteries were manufactured by Eveready, and then by Energizer when Energizer Holdings bought out Eveready. In 2004, Rayovac successfully underbid Energizer as RadioShack's battery supplier. As an added bonus, Rayovac also began packaging the Enercell branded batteries (something RadioShack had previously done themselves), which led to considerably higher profit margins for batteries at RadioShack. Rayovac had formerly manufactured a rechargeable alkaline battery for RadioShack also branded Enercell for a short period of time, however poor sales prompted a switch in branding back to Rayovac Renewal before the product was finally discontinued at RadioShack in 2001.
