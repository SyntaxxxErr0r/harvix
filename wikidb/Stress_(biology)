80.2	Stress_(biology)	Stress (biology)	Stress is a term that is commonly used today but has become increasingly difficult to define. It shares, to some extent, common meanings in both the biological and psychological sciences. Stress typically describes a negative concept that can have an impact on oneâ€™s mental and physical well-being, but it is unclear what exactly defines stress and whether or not stress is a cause, an effect, or the process connecting the two. With organisms as complex as humans, stress can take on entirely concrete or abstract meanings with highly subjective qualities, satisfying definitions of both cause and effect in ways that can be both tangible and intangible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Rotating_brain_colored.gif/220px-Rotating_brain_colored.gif
