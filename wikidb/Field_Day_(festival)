2.20	Field_Day_(festival)	Field Day (festival)	Field Day is an outdoor music festival which takes place in Victoria Park in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, organised by events promoter Tom Baker of Eat Your Own Ears. Similar to sister festival Underage, the single day event takes place around early August of each year. Both festivals usually share similar line-ups, as well as taking place within days of each other. There are five main stages, currently titled the Eat Your Own Ears Main Stage, Adventures in the Beetroot Field Stage, Village Mentality Stage, the Bugged Out! Stage and the Bloggers Delight Stage. Contrary to Underage, the festival is only open to over 18s, and contains on-site bars.
