71.1	Sleep_deprivation	Sleep deprivation	Sleep deprivation is the condition of not having enough sleep; it can be either chronic or acute. A chronic sleep-restricted state can cause fatigue, daytime sleepiness, clumsiness and weight loss or weight gain. It adversely affects the brain and cognitive function. Few studies have compared the effects of acute total sleep deprivation and chronic partial sleep restriction. Complete absence of sleep over long periods is impossible for humans to achieve (unless they suffer from fatal familial insomnia); brief microsleeps cannot be avoided. Long-term total sleep deprivation has caused death in lab animals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Effects_of_sleep_deprivation.svg/300px-Effects_of_sleep_deprivation.svg.png
