13.40	Creme_de_violette	Creme de violette	Cr√®me de Violette, also known as liqueur de violette, is a generic term for a liqueur with natural and/or artificial violet flower flavoring and coloring with either a brandy base, a neutral spirit base, or a combination of the two. The taste profile and aroma are distinctly floral and sweet, and to many reminiscent of the violet candies popular in the early to mid 20th century. Its known production dates back to the early 19th century when it was served with dry vermouth or alone as a cordial.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Creme_de_violette.jpg/100px-Creme_de_violette.jpg
