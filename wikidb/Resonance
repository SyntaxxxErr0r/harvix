85.5	Resonance	Resonance	In physics, resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate at a greater amplitude at some frequencies than at others. These are known as the system's resonant frequencies (or resonance frequencies). At these frequencies, even small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude oscillations, because the system stores vibrational energy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Resonance.PNG/300px-Resonance.PNG
