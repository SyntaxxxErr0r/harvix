8.10	Nyika_Plateau	Nyika Plateau	The Nyika Plateau lies in northern Malawi, with a small portion in north eastern Zambia. Most of it lies at elevations of 2100 to 2200 m, the highest point being 2605m at Nganda Peak. It is roughly a diamond in shape, with a long north-south axis of about 90 km, and an east-west axis of about 50 km. It towers above Lake Malawi (elevation 475 m), and the towns of Livingstonia and Chilumba. Its well-defined north-west escarpment rises about 700 m above the north-eastern extremity of the Luangwa Valley, and its similarly prominent south-east escarpment rises about 1000 m above the South Rukuru River valley.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Nyika_grassland.jpg/340px-Nyika_grassland.jpg
