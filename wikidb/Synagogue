66.4	Synagogue	Synagogue	A synagogue (from Greek: transliterated synagogÄ“, meaning "assembly") is a Jewish or Samaritan house of prayer. This use of the Greek term synagogue originates in the Septuagint where it sometimes translates the Hebrew word for assembly, kahal. In modern Hebrew a synagogue is called either a beyt knesset, meaning "house of assembly"; or beyt t'fila, meaning "house of prayer", in Yiddish shul, from the German for "school," and in Ladino esnoga.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/ZodiacMosaicTzippori.jpg/220px-ZodiacMosaicTzippori.jpg
