97.3	Dodecahedron	Dodecahedron	In geometry, a dodecahedron (Greek δωδεκάεδρον, from δώδεκα, dōdeka "twelve" + ἕδρα hédra "base", "seat" or "face") is any polyhedron with twelve flat faces, but usually a regular dodecahedron is meant: a Platonic solid. It is composed of 12 regular pentagonal faces, with three meeting at each vertex, and is represented by the Schläfli symbol {5,3}. It has 20 vertices and 30 edges. Its dual polyhedron is the icosahedron, with Schläfli symbol {3,5}.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/POV-Ray-Dodecahedron.svg/240px-POV-Ray-Dodecahedron.svg.png
