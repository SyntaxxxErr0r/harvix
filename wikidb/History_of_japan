1.42	History_of_japan	History of Japan	The history of Japan encompasses the history of the islands of Japan and the Japanese people, spanning the ancient history of the region to the modern history of Japan as a nation state. Following the last ice age, around 12,000 BC, the rich ecosystem of the Japanese Archipelago fostered human development. The earliest-known pottery belongs to the J≈çmon period. The first known written reference to Japan is in the brief information given in Twenty-Four Histories in the 1st century AD. The main cultural and religious influences came from China.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Naiku_01.JPG/200px-Naiku_01.JPG
