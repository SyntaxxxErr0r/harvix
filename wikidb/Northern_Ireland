219.7	Northern_Ireland	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland consists of six of the nine counties of the Irish province of Ulster. It was created as a distinct division of the United Kingdom on 3 May 1921 under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, though its constitutional roots lie in the 1800 Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland. For over 50 years it had its own devolved government and parliament. These institutions were suspended in 1972 and abolished in 1973. Repeated attempts to restore self-government finally resulted in the establishment in 1998 of the present-day Northern Ireland Executive and Northern Ireland Assembly. The Assembly operates on consociational democracy principles requiring cross-community support. Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, Northern Ireland is largely self-governing and co-operates with the rest of Ireland, from which it was partitioned in 1921, on some policy areas. Other areas are reserved for the Government of the United Kingdom, upon which the Republic of Ireland may "may put forward views and proposals".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Northern_Ireland_in_the_UK_and_Europe.svg/250px-Northern_Ireland_in_the_UK_and_Europe.svg.png
