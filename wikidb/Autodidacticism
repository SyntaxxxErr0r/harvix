64.0	Autodidacticism	Autodidacticism	Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is self-directed learning. In a sense, autodidacticism is "learning on your own" or "by yourself", and an autodidact is a self-teacher. The term has its roots in the Ancient Greek words αὐτός (autós, or "self") and διδακτικός (didaktikos, meaning "teaching"). The related term Didacticism defines an artistic philosophy of education. Autodidacticism is a contemplative, absorptive procession. Some autodidacts spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field, they may choose to inform themselves in other, often unrelated areas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Leonardo_self.jpg/220px-Leonardo_self.jpg
