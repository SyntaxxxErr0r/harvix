3.00	Roller_skater	Roller skating	Roller skating is the traveling on smooth surfaces with roller skates. It is a form of recreation as well as a sport, and can also be a form of transportation. Skates generally come in three basic varieties: quad roller skates, inline skates or blades and tri-skates, though some have experimented with a single-wheeled "quintessence skate" or other variations on the basic skate design. In America, this hobby was most popular in the 1970s and the 1990s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Neck_and_neck.jpg/220px-Neck_and_neck.jpg
