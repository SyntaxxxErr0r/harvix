18.32	Ice_skate	Ice skate	Ice skates are boots with blades attached to the bottom, used to propel the bearer across a sheet of ice. They are worn as footwear in many sports, including ice hockey, bandy and figure skating. The first ice skates were made from leg bones of horse, ox or deer, and were attached to feet with leather straps. A pole with a sharp metal spike was used for pushing the skater forward.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Eislaufverein_Turnhalle_Graz_7_Feber_1909_mit_Johann_Oberhammer.jpg/220px-Eislaufverein_Turnhalle_Graz_7_Feber_1909_mit_Johann_Oberhammer.jpg
