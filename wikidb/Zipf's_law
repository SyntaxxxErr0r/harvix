108.7	Zipf's_law	Zipf's law	Zipf's law ( ), an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics, refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. The law is named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf who first proposed it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though Jean-Baptiste Estoup appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Zipf_distribution_PMF.png/325px-Zipf_distribution_PMF.png
