97.7	Standby_power	Standby power	Standby power, also called vampire power, vampire draw, phantom load, or leaking electricity ("phantom load" and "leaking electricity" are defined technical terms with other meanings, adopted for this different purpose), refers to the electric power consumed by electronic and electrical appliances while they are switched off (but are designed to draw some power) or in a standby mode. Some such devices offer remote controls and digital clock features to the user, while other devices, such as power adapters for disconnected electronic devices, consume power without offering any features (sometimes called no-load power).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Standby_indicator.jpg/120px-Standby_indicator.jpg
