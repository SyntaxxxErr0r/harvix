97.7	Spaghetti_code	Spaghetti code	Spaghetti code is a pejorative term for source code that has a complex and tangled control structure, especially one using many GOTOs, exceptions, threads, or other "unstructured" branching constructs. It is named such because program flow tends to look like a bowl of spaghetti, i.e. twisted and tangled. Spaghetti code can be caused by several factors, including inexperienced programmers and a complex program which has been continuously modified over a long life cycle. Structured programming greatly decreased the incidence of spaghetti code.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Spaghetti.jpg/175px-Spaghetti.jpg
