The concepts of mass production are applied to various kinds of products, from fluids and particulates handled in bulk (such as food, fuel, chemicals, and mined minerals) to discrete solid parts (such as fasteners) to assemblies of such parts (such as household appliances and automobiles).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Consolidated_TB-32_production_line.jpg/220px-Consolidated_TB-32_production_line.jpg
