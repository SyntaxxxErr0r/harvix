7.01	GS1_DataBar_Coupon	GS1 DataBar Coupon	The GS1 Databar Coupon codes have been in use in retail industry since the mid-1980s. At first, it was a UPC with system ID 5. Since UPCs cannot hold more than 12 digits, it requires another bar code to hold the additional information like offer code, expiration date or household ID numbers. Therefore, it gets extension to UCC/EAN 128 bar code attached to it. EAN 13 bar code was also in use instead of UPC, which starts with 99, hence called EAN 99 coupon barcode. After more than 20 years in use, now there is a need to encode more data for complex couponing, and accommodate longer company ID, and the traditional coupon code becomes less efficient and sometimes not usable at all.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b8/GS1_DataBar_Coupon_Bar_Code_Sample.jpg/250px-GS1_DataBar_Coupon_Bar_Code_Sample.jpg
