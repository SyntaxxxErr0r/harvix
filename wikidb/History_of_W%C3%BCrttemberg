4.11	History_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg	History of Württemberg	Württemberg developed as a political entity in south-west Germany, with the core established around Stuttgart by Count Conrad (d. 1110). His descendants managed to expand Württemberg, surviving Germany's religious wars, changes in imperial policy, and invasions from France. The state had a basic parliamentary system that changed to absolutism in the 18th century. The state was recognised as a kingdom in 1806–1918 and is now a part of the state of Baden-Württemberg. Württemberg was often spelt Wirtemberg or Wurtemberg in English.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/AltesSchlossStuttgart.JPG/250px-AltesSchlossStuttgart.JPG
