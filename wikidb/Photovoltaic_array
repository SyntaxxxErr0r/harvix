55.9	Photovoltaic_array	Photovoltaic system	Photovoltaic systems use solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. A system is made up of one or more solar panels, usually a controller or power converter, and the interconnections and mounting for the other components. A small PV system may provide energy to a single consumer, or to an isolated device like a lamp or a weather instrument. Large grid-connected PV systems can provide the energy needed by many customers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Solaranlage_IMG_0533.jpg/250px-Solaranlage_IMG_0533.jpg
