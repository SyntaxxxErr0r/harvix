64.5	Edward_II_of_England	Edward II of England	Edward II (25 April 1284 â€“ 21 September 1327), called Edward of Caernarfon, was King of England from 1307 until he was deposed by his wife Isabella in January 1327. He was the sixth Plantagenet king, in a line that began with the reign of Henry II. Between the strong reigns of his father Edward I and son Edward III, the reign of Edward II was considered by some to be disastrous for England, marked by alleged incompetence, political squabbling and military defeats.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Edward_II_of_England.png/220px-Edward_II_of_England.png
