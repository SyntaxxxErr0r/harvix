175.8	Latitude	Latitude	In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north-south position of a point on the Earth's surface. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sphere_filled_blue.svg/200px-Sphere_filled_blue.svg.png
