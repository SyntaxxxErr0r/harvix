2.10	Frederico_Garcia_Lorca	Federico García Lorca	Federico del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús García Lorca (Spanish pronunciation: ; 5 June 1898 – 19 August 1936) was a Spanish poet, dramatist and theatre director. García Lorca achieved international recognition as an emblematic member of the Generation of '27. He may have been shot by anti-communist forces during the Spanish Civil War. In 2008, a Spanish judge opened an investigation into Lorca's death. The Garcia Lorca family eventually dropped objections to the excavation of a potential gravesite near Alfacar. However, no human remains were found.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Lorca_%281914%29.jpg/220px-Lorca_%281914%29.jpg
