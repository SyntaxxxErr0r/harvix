6.10	Phulka	Roti	Roti is generally a South Asian bread made from stoneground wholemeal flour, traditionally known as atta flour, that originated and is consumed in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. It is also consumed in parts of the Southern Caribbean, particularly in Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago. Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. Indian naan bread, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread. Roti is sometimes referred to as "Kolcha" in Indian cuisine, albeit this term is seldom used outside of the nation	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Chapati.jpg/200px-Chapati.jpg
