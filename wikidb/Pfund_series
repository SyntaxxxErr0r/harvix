1.00	Pfund_series	Hydrogen spectral series	The emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen is divided into a number of spectral series, with wavelengths given by the Rydberg formula. These observed spectral lines are due to electrons moving between energy levels in the atom. The spectral series are important in astronomy for detecting the presence of hydrogen and calculating red shifts. Further series were discovered as spectroscopy techniques developed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Hydrogen_spectrum.svg/500px-Hydrogen_spectrum.svg.png
