6.31	Silent_700	Silent 700	The Silent 700 was a line of portable computer terminals manufactured by Texas Instruments in the 1970s and 1980s. Silent 700s printed with a dot-matrix heating element onto a roll of heat-sensitive paper. Some models were equipped with an integrated acoustic coupler and modem that could receive data at 30 characters per second. Other models could be directly connected to computers at 300 baud, and were sometimes used as the System console where a hard copy record of the activities would be retained for a period of time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Silent-700.jpg/220px-Silent-700.jpg
