2.20	Upper_memory_area	Upper memory area	In DOS memory management, the upper memory area refers to memory between the addresses of 640 KB and 1024 KB (0xA0000–0xFFFFF) in an IBM PC or compatible. IBM reserved the uppermost 384 KB of the 8088 CPU's 1024 KB address space for ROM, RAM on peripherals, and memory-mapped input/output. For example, the monochrome video memory area runs from 704 to 736 KB (0xB0000–B7FFF).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4d/IBM_PC_Memory_areas.svg/220px-IBM_PC_Memory_areas.svg.png
