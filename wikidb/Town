94.2	Town	Town	A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a "town" varies considerably in different parts of the world, so that, for example, many "small towns" in the United States would be regarded as villages in the United Kingdom, while many British "small towns" would qualify as cities in the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Turkish.town.cesme.jpg/220px-Turkish.town.cesme.jpg
