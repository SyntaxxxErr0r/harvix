71.6	Type_system	Type system	A type system associates a type with each computed value. By examining the flow of these values, a type system attempts to ensure or prove that no type errors can occur. The particular type system in question determines exactly what constitutes a type error, but in general the aim is to prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value being used with values for which that operation does not make sense ; memory errors will also be prevented. Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages, and built into the interpreters and compilers for them; although they can also be implemented as optional tools.
