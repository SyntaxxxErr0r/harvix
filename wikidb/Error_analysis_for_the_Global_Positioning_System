6.40	Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System	Error analysis for the Global Positioning System	The analysis of errors computed using the Global Positioning System is important for understanding how GPS works, and for knowing what magnitude errors should be expected. The Global Positioning System makes corrections for receiver clock errors and other effects but there are still residual errors which are not corrected. The Global Positioning System (GPS) was created by the United States Department of Defense (DOD) in the 1970s. It has come to be widely used for navigation both by the U.S. military and the general public.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/GPS_Satellite_NASA_art-iif.jpg/220px-GPS_Satellite_NASA_art-iif.jpg
