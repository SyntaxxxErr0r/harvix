It is also the busiest airport in the EU by passenger traffic and the third busiest in Europe given the number of traffic movements, with a figure surpassed only by Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport and Frankfurt Airport. Heathrow is London's main airport, having replaced RAF Northolt, and together with Gatwick, Stansted, Luton and London City, more than 175 million passengers have travelled in total, making London by far the busiest city airport system in the world. The airport sustains 76,600 jobs directly and around 116,000 indirectly in the immediate area, and this, together with the large number of global corporations with offices close to the airport, makes Heathrow a modern aerotropolis which contributes an estimated 2.7% to London's total GVA.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Heathrow_Airport_logo.png/200px-Heathrow_Airport_logo.png
