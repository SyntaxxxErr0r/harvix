103.9	Operation_Barbarossa	Operation Barbarossa	Operation Barbarossa was the code name for Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Beginning on 22 June 1941, over 3.9 million troops of the Axis powers invaded the USSR along a 2,900 km (1,800 mi) front, the largest invasion in the history of warfare. In addition to troops, Barbarossa involved 600,000 motor vehicles and 750,000 horses. The ambitious operation, driven by Adolf Hitler's persistent desire to conquer the Russian territories, marked the beginning of the pivotal phase in deciding the victors of the war. The German invasion of the Soviet Union ultimately resulted in 95% of all German Army casualties from 1941 to 1944 and 65% of all Allied military casualties accumulated throughout the war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Operation_Barbarossa_corrected_border.png/250px-Operation_Barbarossa_corrected_border.png
