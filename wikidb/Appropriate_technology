102.8	Appropriate_technology	Appropriate technology	Between 1966 and 1975 the number of new appropriate technology organizations founded each year was three times higher than the previous nine years. There was also an increase in organizations focusing on applying appropriate technology to the problems of industrialized nations, particularly issues related to energy and the environment. In 1977, the OECD identified in its Appropriate Technology Directory 680 organizations involved in the development and promotion of appropriate technology. By 1980, this number had grown to more than 1,000. International agencies and government departments were also emerging as major innovators in appropriate technology, indicating its progression from a small movement fighting against the established norms to a legitimate technological choice supported by the establishment. For example, the Inter-American Development Bank created a Committee for the Application of Intermediate Technology in 1976 and the World Health Organization established the Appropriate Technology for Health Program in 1977.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/RachelAndMachine.jpg/220px-RachelAndMachine.jpg
