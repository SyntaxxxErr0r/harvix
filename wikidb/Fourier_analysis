54.6	Fourier_analysis	Fourier analysis	In mathematics, Fourier analysis is a subject area which grew from the study of Fourier series. The subject began with the study of the way general functions may be represented by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. Fourier analysis is named after Joseph Fourier, who showed that representing a function by a trigonometric series greatly simplifies the study of heat propagation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Variations_of_the_Fourier_transform.tif/lossless-page1-400px-Variations_of_the_Fourier_transform.tif.png
