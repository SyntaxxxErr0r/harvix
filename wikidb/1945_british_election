1.00	1945_british_election	United Kingdom general election, 1945	The United Kingdom general election of 1945 was a general election held on 5 July 1945, with polls in some constituencies delayed until 12 July and in Nelson and Colne until 19 July, because of local wakes weeks. The results were counted and declared on 26 July, owing in part to the time it took to transport the votes of those serving overseas. The result was a surprise landslide victory for Clement Attlee's Labour Party, over Winston Churchill's Conservatives, giving Labour its first majority government, and a mandate to implement its postwar reforms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Attlee_BW_cropped.jpg/105px-Attlee_BW_cropped.jpg
