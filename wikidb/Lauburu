12.23	Lauburu	Lauburu	The lauburu or Basque cross has four comma-shaped heads similar to the Japanese tomoe. It can be constructed with a compass and straightedge, beginning with the formation of a square template; each head can be drawn from a neighboring vertex of this template with two compass settings, with one radius half the length of the other.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Lauburu.svg/220px-Lauburu.svg.png
