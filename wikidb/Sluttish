1.00	Sluttish	Slut	Slut or slattern is a term applied to an individual who is considered to have loose sexual morals or who is sexually promiscuous. The term is generally pejorative and most often applied to women as an insult or offensive term of disparagement, meaning "dirty or slovenly." However some women have demonstrated saying they're proud of being "sluts", and have given it a positive connotation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/SlutWalk_NYC_October_2011_Shankbone_25.JPG/220px-SlutWalk_NYC_October_2011_Shankbone_25.JPG
