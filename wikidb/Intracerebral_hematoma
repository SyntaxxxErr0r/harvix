1.00	Intracerebral_hematoma	Cerebral hemorrhage	A cerebral hemorrhage or haemorrhage (or intracerebral hemorrhage, ICH) is a subtype of a intracranial hemorrhage that occurs within the brain tissue itself. Intracerebral hemorrhage can be caused by brain trauma, or it can occur spontaneously in hemorrhagic stroke. Non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage is a spontaneous bleeding into the brain tissue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Intracerebral_heamorrage.jpg/230px-Intracerebral_heamorrage.jpg
