51.3	Hybrid_car	Hybrid electric vehicle	A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is a type of hybrid vehicle and electric vehicle which combines a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) propulsion system with an electric propulsion system. The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle, or better performance. A variety of types of HEV exist, and the degree to which they function as EVs varies as well. The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car, although hybrid electric trucks (pickups and tractors) and buses also exist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/2nd-Toyota-Prius.jpg/200px-2nd-Toyota-Prius.jpg
