1.00	Recovery_(novel)	Recovery (novel)	Recovery is the first e-book and seventh installment of The New Jedi Order series set in the Star Wars galaxy. This short story by Troy Denning sets the stage for much of the novel Star by Star and shows a slow reconciliation between Han Solo and his wife Leia Organa Solo. The mass market paperback Star by Star begins with Recovery as essentially a lengthy prologue; the hard-cover however, does not.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b1/Recovery%28novel%29.jpg/200px-Recovery%28novel%29.jpg
