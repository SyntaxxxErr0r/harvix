78.7	Ljubljana	Ljubljana	For centuries, Ljubljana was the capital of the historical region of Carniola, and in the 20th century it became the cultural, educational, economic, political and administrative centre of Slovenia, independent since 1991. Its transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific and research institutions and cultural tradition are contributing factors to its leading position.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/19/Ljubljanalandmarks.JPG/280px-Ljubljanalandmarks.JPG
