77.0	Digital-to-analog_converter	Digital-to-analog converter	In electronics, a digital-to-analog converter is a device that converts a digital (usually binary) code to an analog signal (current, voltage, or electric charge). An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performs the reverse operation. Signals are easily stored and transmitted in digital form, but a DAC is needed for the signal to be recognized by human senses or other non-digital systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/CirrusLogicCS4282-AB.jpg/200px-CirrusLogicCS4282-AB.jpg
