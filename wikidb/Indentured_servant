61.9	Indentured_servant	Indentured servant	Workers, usually Europeans, including Irish, Scottish, English, or German immigrants, immigrated to Colonial America in substantial numbers as indentured servants, particularly to the British Thirteen Colonies. In the 17th century, nearly two-thirds of English settlers came as indentured servants, although indentured servitude was not a guaranteed route to economic autonomy. Given the high death rate, many servants did not live to the end of their terms. In the 18th and early 19th century, numerous Europeans traveled to the colonies as redemptioners, a form of indenture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Indenturecertificate.jpg/220px-Indenturecertificate.jpg
