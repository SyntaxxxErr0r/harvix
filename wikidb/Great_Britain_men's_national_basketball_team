The current governing body for the Great Britain team was formed by the national basketball organisations of England , Scotland (basketballscotland) and Wales (Basketball Wales) on 1 December 2005 in order to provide a competitive team for international competition. This structure does not include the basketball association of Northern Ireland; Northern Irish players normally represent the Ireland national basketball team, though they are also eligible to compete for Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the Olympic Games.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/British_Basketball_logo.png/200px-British_Basketball_logo.png
