1.00	Tidal_Basin_railway_station	Tidal Basin railway station	Tidal Basin railway station was a railway station near the Royal Victoria Dock, Canning Town, London, on the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway. It opened in 1857, and was between Canning Town and Custom House stations. The station closed in 1943 after severe bombing damage during the Blitz, and never reopened. The area was heavily redeveloped following the War, and today no trace remains; its approximate location is south east of Tarling Road (formerly Alice Street), east of the present day footbridge. Royal Victoria DLR station is located approximately 300 yards east.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Broad_street_station_1865.png/150px-Broad_street_station_1865.png
