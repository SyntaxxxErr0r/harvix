58.4	Centaur	Centaur	In Greek mythology, a centaur (from Greek: – Kéntauroi) or hippocentaur is a member of a composite race of creatures, part human and part horse. In early Attic and Boeotian vase-paintings (see below), they are depicted with the hindquarters of a horse attached to them; in later renderings centaurs are given the torso of a human joined at the waist to the horse's withers, where the horse's neck would be.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Centaure_Malmaison_crop.jpg/220px-Centaure_Malmaison_crop.jpg
