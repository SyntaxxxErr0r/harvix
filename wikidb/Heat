125.7	Heat	Heat	In physics, chemistry, engineering, and thermodynamics, a quantity of heat is an amount of energy produced or transferred from one body, region of space, set of components, or thermodynamic system to another in any way other than as work. This definition is the carefully developed fruit of the finding from experiments in physics that in general a definite statement cannot be made of "the amount of heat in a body" although ordinary language appears to suggest that such a statement could be made.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/171879main_LimbFlareJan12_lg.jpg/300px-171879main_LimbFlareJan12_lg.jpg
