2.20	Dryopteris_marginalis	Dryopteris marginalis	Dryopteris marginalis is known as the marginal shield fern or marginal wood fern. The marginal wood fern favors damp shady areas and is found throughout eastern North America. It favors moderately acid to circumneutral soils. It favors cooler areas, but is fairly drought-resistant once established. In the warmer parts of its range, it is most likely to be found on north-facing non-calcareous rock faces.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/DryopterisMarginalis.jpg/220px-DryopterisMarginalis.jpg
