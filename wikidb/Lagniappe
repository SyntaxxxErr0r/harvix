62.9	Lagniappe	Lagniappe	A lagniappe ( -yap) is a small gift given to a customer by a merchant at the time of a purchase (such as a 13th doughnut when buying a dozen), or more broadly, "something given or obtained gratuitously or by way of good measure." The word is chiefly used in the Gulf Coast of the United States, but the concept is practiced in many countries where community is the emphasis, such as North Africa, rural France, and Holland.
