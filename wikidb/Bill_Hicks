95.5	Bill_Hicks	Bill Hicks	William Melvin "Bill" Hicks (December 16, 1961 â€“ February 26, 1994) was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist, and musician. His material largely consisted of general discussions about society, religion, politics, philosophy, and personal issues. Hicks' material was often controversial and steeped in dark comedy. In both his stand-up performances and during interviews, he often criticized consumerism, superficiality, mediocrity, and banality within the media and popular culture, describing them as oppressive tools of the ruling class, meant to "keep people stupid and apathetic".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Bill_Hicks_image.jpg/250px-Bill_Hicks_image.jpg
