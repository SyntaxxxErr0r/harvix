1.00	Real-time_database	Real-time database	A real-time database is a processing system designed to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing (Buchmann). This differs from traditional databases containing persistent data, mostly unaffected by time. For example, a stock market changes very rapidly and is dynamic. The graphs of the different markets appear to be very unstable and yet a database has to keep track of current values for all of the markets of the New York Stock Exchange (Kanitkar). Real-time processing means that a transaction is processed fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away (Capron). Real-time databases are useful for accounting, banking, law, medical records, multi-media, process control, reservation systems, and scientific data analysis (Snodgrass). As computers increase in power and can store more data, they are integrating themselves into our society and are employed in many applications.
