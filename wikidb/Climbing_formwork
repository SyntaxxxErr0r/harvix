1.00	Climbing_formwork	Climbing formwork	Climbing formwork is a special type of formwork for vertical concrete structures that rises with the building process. While relatively complicated and costly, it can be an effective solution for buildings that are either very repetitive in form (such as towers or skyscrapers) or that require a seamless wall structure (using gliding formwork, a special type of climbing formwork).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Takapuna_Sentinel_Building_Construction.jpg/220px-Takapuna_Sentinel_Building_Construction.jpg
