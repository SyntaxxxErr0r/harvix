51.6	Great_Basin	Great Basin	The Great Basin is the largest area of contiguous endorheic watersheds in North America. It is noted for both its arid conditions and its Basin and Range topography that varies from the North American low point at Badwater Basin to the highest point of the contiguous United States, less than 100 miles (160 km) away at the summit of Mount Whitney. The region spans several physiographic divisions, biomes/ecoregions, and deserts, and is the ancestral homeland of the Great Basin tribes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Greatbasinmap.png/300px-Greatbasinmap.png
