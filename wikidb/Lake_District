A popular holiday destination, it is famous not only for its lakes and its mountains (or fells) but also for its associations with the early 19th century poetry and writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Keswick_Panorama_-_Oct_2009.jpg/400px-Keswick_Panorama_-_Oct_2009.jpg
