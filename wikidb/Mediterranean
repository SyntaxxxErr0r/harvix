138.7	Mediterranean	Mediterranean Sea	The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean surrounded by the Mediterranean region and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is often identified as a completely separate body of water.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Mediterranean_Sea_political_map-en.svg/240px-Mediterranean_Sea_political_map-en.svg.png
