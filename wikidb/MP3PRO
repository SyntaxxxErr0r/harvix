1.00	MP3PRO	mp3PRO	mp3PRO is an audio compression algorithm (or codec) that combines the MP3 audio format with spectral band replication (SBR) compression methods. It claims to achieve transparency at lower bitrates than MP3, resulting in a file nearly half the size of standard MP3. RCA was the only company to offer portable players compatible with mp3PRO, but they have dropped support for the format.
