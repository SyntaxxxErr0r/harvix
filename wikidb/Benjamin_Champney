6.10	Benjamin_Champney	Benjamin Champney	Benjamin Champney (November 20, 1817 – December 11, 1907) was a painter whose name has become synonymous with White Mountain art of the 19th century. He began his training as a lithographer under celebrated marine artist Fitz Henry Lane at Pendleton's Lithography shop in Boston. Most art historians consider him the founder of the "North Conway Colony" of painters who came to North Conway, New Hampshire and the surrounding area during the second half of the 19th century. His paintings were often used to make chromolithographs that were subsequently sold to tourists who could not afford Champney's originals. He exhibited regularly at the Boston Athenæum and was a founder of the Boston Art Club	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Benjamin_Champney_%28JJH-BC%29.jpg/220px-Benjamin_Champney_%28JJH-BC%29.jpg
