1.00	Mer_d'Iroise	Iroise Sea	The Iroise Sea or Mer d'Iroise is the part of the Atlantic Ocean which stretches from the Ile de Sein to Ushant off the coast of Brittany in north-western France. It borders on the English Channel to the north, the Celtic Sea to the west and the Bay of Biscay to the south. The origin of the name is not clear. It appears to be fairly recent dating back to the 17th century when naval maps referred to the Passage de l'Iroise.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Iroise_sea_map-en.svg/250px-Iroise_sea_map-en.svg.png
