15.42	Rugbr%C3%B8d	Rugbrød	Rugbrød (Danish rye bread) is a very commonly used bread in Denmark. The common rugbrød usually resembles a long brown rectangle, no more than 12 cm high, and 30–35 cm wide, although shapes and sizes may vary, as well as the ingredients. Sourdough is almost always the base; the bread may be made exclusively with rye and wheat flour or contains up to one third whole rye grains. Variants with whole sunflower or other seeds also exist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/2006-02-05_13-11_100_1202.JPG/250px-2006-02-05_13-11_100_1202.JPG
