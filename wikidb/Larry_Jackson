4.40	Larry_Jackson	Larry Jackson	Lawrence Curtis Jackson (June 2, 1931 â€“ August 28, 1990) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies from 1955 to 1968. In 1964 he led the National League with 24 wins for an eighth-place Cubs team, and was runnerup in the Cy Young Award voting; he also led the NL in innings pitched and shutouts once each. His 194 career NL victories are the most in the league since 1900 by any right-hander who never played for a first-place team. A model of reliability, he won at least 13 games in each of his last twelve seasons. He later served four terms in the Idaho Legislature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Larry_Jackson.jpg/200px-Larry_Jackson.jpg
