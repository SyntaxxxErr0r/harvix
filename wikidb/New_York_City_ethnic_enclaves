The enclave is situated on 116th Street between St. Nicholas and 8th Avenues, and is home to a large number of Francophone West Africans. Many natives also speak Wolof, an African language which is spoken alongside French in Senegal, and the neighborhood also has residents from countries such as Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Guinea, and Mali.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/116thHarlem01.jpg/220px-116thHarlem01.jpg
