72.1	Horizontal_gene_transfer	Horizontal gene transfer	Horizontal gene transfer , also lateral gene transfer (LGT) refers to the transfer of genetic material between organisms other than vertical gene transfer. Vertical transfer occurs when there is gene exchange from the parental generation to the offspring. LGT is then a mechanism of gene exchange that happens independently of reproduction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Horizontal-gene-transfer.jpg/220px-Horizontal-gene-transfer.jpg
