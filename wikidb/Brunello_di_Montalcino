87.1	Brunello_di_Montalcino	Brunello di Montalcino	Brunello di Montalcino is a red Italian wine produced in the vineyards surrounding the town of Montalcino located about 120 km south of Florence in the Tuscany wine region. Brunello, roughly translated as "small dark one" in the local dialect, is the unofficial name of the clone of Sangiovese (also known as Sangiovese Grosso) grown in the Montalcino region. In 1980, the Brunello di Montalcino was awarded the first Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) designation and today is one of Italy's best-known and most expensive wines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Montalcino_001.jpg/300px-Montalcino_001.jpg
