84.8	Reductionism	Reductionism	Reductionism can mean either (a) an approach to understanding the nature of complex things by reducing them to the interactions of their parts, or to simpler or more fundamental things or (b) a philosophical position that a complex system is nothing but the sum of its parts, and that an account of it can be reduced to accounts of individual constituents. This can be said of objects, phenomena, explanations, theories, and meanings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Duck_of_Vaucanson.jpg
