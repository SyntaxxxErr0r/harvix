55.7	Coral_Castle	Coral Castle	Coral Castle is a stone structure created by the Latvian American eccentric Edward Leedskalnin (1887-1951) north of the city of Homestead, Florida in Miami-Dade County at the intersection of South Dixie Highway and West 157th Avenue. The structure comprises numerous megalithic stones (mostly limestone formed from coral), each weighing several tons. It currently serves as a privately-operated tourist attraction. Coral Castle is noted for urban legends surrounding its creation that claim it was built single-handedly by Leedskalnin using magnetism and/or supernatural abilities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Coral_Castle_1.jpg/250px-Coral_Castle_1.jpg
