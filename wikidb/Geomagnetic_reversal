56.0	Geomagnetic_reversal	Geomagnetic reversal	A geomagnetic reversal is a change in the Earth's magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south are interchanged. The Earth's field has alternated between periods of normal polarity, in which the direction of the field was the same as the present direction, and reverse polarity, in which the field was the opposite. These periods are called chrons. The time spans of chrons are randomly distributed with most being between 0.1 and 1million years with an average of 450,000 years. Most reversals are estimated to take between 1,000 and 10,000 years. The latest one, the Brunhesâ€“Matuyama reversal, occurred 780,000 years ago. Brief disruptions that do not result in reversal are called geomagnetic excursions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg/285px-Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg.png
