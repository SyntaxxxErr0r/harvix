The park was created in 1906 by President Theodore Roosevelt, to protect some of the best-preserved cliff dwellings in the world, or as he said, "preserve the works of man". It occupies 81.4 square miles (211 km2) near the Four Corners and features numerous ruins of homes and villages built by the Ancestral Puebloan people, sometimes called the Anasazi. There you can find over 4,000 archaeological sites and over 600 cliff dwellings of the Pueblo people.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/MesaVerdeNationalParkCliffPalace.jpg/284px-MesaVerdeNationalParkCliffPalace.jpg
