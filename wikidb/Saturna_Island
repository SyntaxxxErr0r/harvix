It is situated approximately midway between the Lower Mainland of B.C. and Vancouver Island, and is the most easterly of the Gulf Islands. It is surrounded on three sides by the Canada/USA border. To the north is Point Roberts, Washington, and to the east and south are the San Juan Islands. Saturna has a permanent population of around 350, although that number increases significantly during the busy summer season. Approximately half of the island is in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve(GINPR) that was formed in 2003 from existing provincial parks, an Ecological Reserve, and other Crown land .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Gulf_Islands_map.png/250px-Gulf_Islands_map.png
