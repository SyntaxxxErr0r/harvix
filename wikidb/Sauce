59.3	Sauce	Sauce	In cooking, a sauce is liquid, creaming or semi-solid food served on or used in preparing other foods. Sauces are not normally consumed by themselves; they add flavor, moisture, and visual appeal to another dish. Sauce is a French word taken from the Latin salsus, meaning salted. Possibly the oldest sauce recorded is garum, the fish sauce used by the Ancient Romans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Sauce_boat.jpg/250px-Sauce_boat.jpg
