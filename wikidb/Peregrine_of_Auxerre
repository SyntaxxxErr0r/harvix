1.00	Peregrine_of_Auxerre	Peregrine of Auxerre	Saint Peregrine (Peregrinus) of Auxerre (French: , Italian: ) (d. ca. 261 AD or ca. 304 AD) is venerated as the first bishop of Auxerre and the builder of its first cathedral. A strong local tradition states that he was a priest of Rome appointed by Pope Sixtus II to evangelize this area at the request of the Christians resident in that part of Gaul. He preached at Marseilles, Lyon, and converted most of the inhabitants of Auxerre to Christianity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Auxerre_-_Cathedrale_Saint-Etienne_-_01.jpg/150px-Auxerre_-_Cathedrale_Saint-Etienne_-_01.jpg
