Callery pears are deciduous trees growing to 15 to 20 m (49 to 66 ft) tall, often with a conic to rounded crown. Their leaves are oval, 4 to 7 cm (1.6 to 2.8 in) long, glossy dark green above, and slightly paler below. The white, five-petaled flowers are about 2 to 3 cm (0.79 to 1.2 in) in diameter. They are produced abundantly in early spring, before the leaves expand fully. The flowers have an unpleasant odor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Pyrus_calleryana_.JPG/220px-Pyrus_calleryana_.JPG
