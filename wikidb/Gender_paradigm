1.00	Gender_paradigm	Gender role	Gender roles refer to the set of social and behavioral norms that are considered to be socially appropriate for individuals of a specific sex in the context of a specific culture, which differ widely between cultures and over time. There are differences of opinion as to whether observed gender differences in behavior and personality characteristics are, at least in part, due to cultural or social factors, and therefore, the product of socialization experiences, or to what extent gender differences are due to biological and physiological differences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/WomanFactory1940s.jpg/220px-WomanFactory1940s.jpg
