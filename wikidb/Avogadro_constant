84.4	Avogadro_constant	Avogadro constant	A modern method to determine the Avogadro constant is the use of X-ray crystallography. Silicon single crystals may be produced today in commercial facilities with extremely high purity with few lattice defects. This method defines the Avogadro constant as the ratio of the molar volume, Vm, to the atomic volume Vatom:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Silicon-unit-cell-labelled-3D-balls.png/200px-Silicon-unit-cell-labelled-3D-balls.png
