1.11	Weenen_massacre	Weenen massacre	The Weenen Massacre was the massacre of Voortrekkers by the Zulu on 17 February 1838. After the murder of Piet Retief and his delegation, the Zulu chief Dingane sent his impis to exterminate the remaining voortrekkers who were camped at Doringkop, Bloukrans (i.e. Blaauwekrans), Moordspruit, Rensburgspruit and other sites along the Bushman River (Zulu: ), in the present province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The present day town of Weenen, situated close to these sites, derives its name from the Dutch word for "weeping".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Bloukransmonument.JPG/240px-Bloukransmonument.JPG
