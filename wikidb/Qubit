66.4	Qubit	Qubit	In quantum computing, a qubit ( ) or quantum bit is a unit of quantum information—the quantum analogue of the classical bit—with additional dimensions associated to the quantum properties of a physical atom. The physical construction of a quantum computer is itself an arrangement of entangled atoms, and the qubit represents both the state memory and the state of entanglement in a system. A quantum computation is performed by initializing a system of qubits with a quantum algorithm —"initialization" here referring to some advanced physical process that puts the system into an entangled state.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Bloch_sphere.svg/220px-Bloch_sphere.svg.png
