2.31	1995_Spanish_Grand_Prix	1995 Spanish Grand Prix	The 1995 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on May 14, 1995 at the Circuit de Catalunya, Barcelona. It was the fourth race of the 1995 Formula One season. It proved to be the final race for former champion Nigel Mansell, who quit the McLaren team after the race. Both Damon Hill and Rubens Barrichello experienced gearbox problems on the final lap, Hill dropping from 2nd (which would have kept him in the lead of the championship) and Barrichello from 6th. This gave the Benetton team their first 1-2 finish since the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Circuit_Catalunya.png/220px-Circuit_Catalunya.png
