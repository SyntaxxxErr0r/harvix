7.30	Shufflepuck_Caf%C3%A9	Shufflepuck Café	Shufflepuck Café is a computer air hockey game developed by Christopher Gross, Gene Portwood and Lauren Elliott for Brøderbund (not a table shuffleboard video game, as the name would suggest- though that was the intention when the name was first coined by Christopher Gross). Originally developed for the Apple Macintosh, it was later adapted by Brøderbund for the Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS (leaked version), Amstrad CPC, Family Computer, Sharp X68000, NEC PC-9801 and DOS operating systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/31/Shufflepuck_Caf%C3%A9_Coverart.png
