76.0	Apple_Lossless	Apple Lossless	Apple Lossless (also known as ALAC , or ALE (Apple Lossless Encoder)) is an audio codec developed by Apple Inc. for lossless data compression of digital music. After initially being proprietary for many years, in late 2011 Apple open sourced and made royalty-free the Apple Lossless codec. It is worth noting that Apple does not use the ALAC abbreviation, always using the name Apple Lossless when presenting or discussing this codec, but it is more commonly referred to as ALAC outside of Apple.
