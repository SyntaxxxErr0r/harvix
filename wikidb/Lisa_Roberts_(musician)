1.10	Lisa_Roberts_(musician)	Hole (band)	Hole is an American alternative rock band that originally formed in Los Angeles. Formed in 1989, the band is fronted by singer-songwriter Courtney Love , who co-founded Hole with Eric Erlandson (lead guitar). Hole achieved considerable commercial and critical success throughout the 1990s, initially releasing singles through independent labels in L.A. and debuting with their caustic noise rock-influenced Pretty on the Inside (1991), and later gaining near-unanimous critical acclaim with their 1994 album Live Through This.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/HoleSXSW2010%28wide%29.jpg/250px-HoleSXSW2010%28wide%29.jpg
