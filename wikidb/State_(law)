12.14	State_(law)	Jurisdiction (area)	A jurisdiction is an area with a set of laws under the control of a system of courts or government entity which are different to neighbouring areas. Unitary states usually form single jurisdictions, whilst each state in a federal state forms a separate jurisdiction. However sometimes certain laws in a federal state are uniform across the constituent states and enforced by a set of federal courts; with a result that the federal state forms a single jurisdiction for that purpose.
