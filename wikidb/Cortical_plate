It plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. It is constituted of up to six horizontal layers, each of which has a different composition in terms of neurons and connectivity. The human cerebral cortex is 2–4 mm (0.08–0.16 inches) thick.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Brainmaps-macaque-hippocampus.jpg/250px-Brainmaps-macaque-hippocampus.jpg
