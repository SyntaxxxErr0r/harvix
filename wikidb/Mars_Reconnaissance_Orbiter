55.4	Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter	Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter	Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and Exploration of Mars from orbit. The spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin under the supervision of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The mission is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at California Institute of Technology, La Canada Flintridge, California, for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. It was launched August 12, 2005, and attained Martian orbit on March 10, 2006. In November 2006, after five months of aerobraking, it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase. As MRO entered orbit it joined five other active spacecraft which were either in orbit or on the planet surface: Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Express, Mars Odyssey, and two Mars Exploration Rovers; at the time a record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter.jpg/300px-Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter.jpg
