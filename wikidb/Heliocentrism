72.1	Heliocentrism	Heliocentrism	Heliocentrism, or heliocentricism, is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a relatively stationary Sun at the center of our Solar System. The word comes from the Greek ( helios "sun" and kentron "center"). Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but had received no support from most other ancient astronomers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Heliocentric.jpg/250px-Heliocentric.jpg
