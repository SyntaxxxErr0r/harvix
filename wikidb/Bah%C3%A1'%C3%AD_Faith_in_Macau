1.10	Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith_in_Macau	Bahá'í Faith in Macau	The Bahá'í Faith in Macau (also spelled Macau) was established much later than in China due, most likely, to the unique conditions of Macau being a Portuguese colony until 1999 and it being somewhat in the shadow of Hong Kong and larger centers in mainland China like Shanghai. The Bahá'í Faith arrived in Shanghai in 1862 and Hong Kong in 1870 but not in Macau until 1953.
