12.00	Sutherland_Falls	Sutherland Falls	Sutherland Falls is a waterfall near Milford Sound in New Zealand's South Island. At 580 metres (1,904 feet) the falls were long believed to be the tallest waterfall in New Zealand. However, Browne Falls cascades 843 metres (2,766 feet) down a mountainside in Doubtful Sound, leading some to view that as the tallest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Sutherland_Falls.jpg/220px-Sutherland_Falls.jpg
