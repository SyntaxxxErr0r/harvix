50.9	Mirage	Mirage	A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. The word comes to English via the French mirage, from the Latin mirare, meaning "to look at, to wonder at". This is the same root as for "mirror" and "to admire".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Farallon_Islands_at_inferior_mirage_no_mirage_and_superior_mirage.jpg/350px-Farallon_Islands_at_inferior_mirage_no_mirage_and_superior_mirage.jpg
