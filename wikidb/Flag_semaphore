83.5	Flag_semaphore	Flag semaphore	Semaphore Flags is the system for conveying information at a distance by means of visual signals with hand-held flags, rods, disks, paddles, or occasionally bare or gloved hands. Information is encoded by the position of the flags; it is read when the flag is in a fixed position. Semaphores were adopted and widely used (with hand-held flags replacing the mechanical arms of shutter semaphores) in the maritime world in the 19th century. It is still used during underway replenishment at sea and is acceptable for emergency communication in daylight or, using lighted wands instead of flags, at night.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Semaphore_Papa.svg/180px-Semaphore_Papa.svg.png
