Confederate forces under Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard launched a surprise attack on Grant there. The Confederates achieved considerable success on the first day, but were ultimately defeated on the second day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Battle_of_Shiloh_Thulstrup.jpg/300px-Battle_of_Shiloh_Thulstrup.jpg
