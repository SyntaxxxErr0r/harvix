2.00	Historical_District	Historic districts in the United States	In the United States, a historic district is a group of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size: some have hundreds of structures, while others have just a few.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Sycamore_Il_District_Streets1.jpg/250px-Sycamore_Il_District_Streets1.jpg
