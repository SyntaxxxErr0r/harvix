6.30	Twelve_Nidanas	Twelve Nidānas	The Twelve Nidānas (Pali/Sanskrit nidāna "cause, foundation, source or origin") are the best-known application of the Buddhist concept of pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination), identifying the origins of dukkha (suffering) to be in tanha (craving) and avijja (ignorance). The doctrine has been through a series of interpretations and re-interpretations in the many centuries of Buddhist history, and in various Buddhist cultures, with a broad range of thematic concerns that now intersect in modern interpretations; influential sources are as diverse as Tibet's Je Tsongkhapa (15th century) and Thailand's Buddhadasa (20th century). This article begins by examining the most ancient (extant) sources.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/100px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png
