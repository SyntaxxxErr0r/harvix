1.20	Sherbourne_Street	List of northâ€“south roads in Toronto	Brown's Line was once the name by which the trail running north from Lake Ontario to Highway 9 was known. It originated as a trail which had been blazed to define the western boundary of the 1805 Toronto Purchase. The trail was eventually referred as "Brown's Line" as the northern terminus was a small town, now known as Schomberg, but originally called Brownsville. Since the hamlet's main inhabitant was known by the surname of Brown, it seemed logical that the road which transported persons to Brown's Town should be referred to as Brown's Line. There was, however another Brownsville just south of Ingersoll, Ontario, also named for the family in that town. Since there was obviously confusion in the mail system, the logic required a name change, and Schomberg was created likely for Meinhardt Schomberg, 3rd Duke of Schomberg, a general under King William III of England. Before the construction of Highway 427, Brown's Line was part of Highway 27. Today, Brown's Line is a small southern portion of the road which has grown into Highway 427 from the Queen Elizabeth to Highway 401, and carries on as Highway 27, past Highway 9, and continues north to Barrie.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Browns_Line_Sign.jpg/125px-Browns_Line_Sign.jpg
