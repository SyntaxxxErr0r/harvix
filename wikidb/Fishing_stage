2.20	Fishing_stage	Fishing stage	A fishing stage is a wooden vernacular building, typical of the rough traditional buildings associated with the cod fishery in Newfoundland, Canada. Stages are located at the water's edge or "landwash", and consist of an elevated platform on the shore with working tables and sheds at which fish are landed and processed for salting and drying. Traditionally, they are painted with a red ochre paint, though colours other than red are sometimes seen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Carlb-fogo-newfoundland-fishery-2002.jpg/240px-Carlb-fogo-newfoundland-fishery-2002.jpg
