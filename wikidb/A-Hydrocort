1.00	A-Hydrocort	Cortisol	Cortisol is a steroid hormone, more specifically a glucocorticoid, produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland. It is released in response to stress and a low level of blood glucocorticoids. Its primary functions are to increase blood sugar through glycogenolysis; suppress the immune system; and aid in fat, protein and carbohydrate metabolism. It also decreases bone formation. During pregnancy, increased production of cortisol between weeks 30 and 32 initiates production of fetal lung surfactant to promote maturation of the lungs. Various synthetic forms of cortisol are used to treat a variety of diseases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Cortisol2.svg/225px-Cortisol2.svg.png
