2.00	Ely_Abbey	Ely Cathedral	Ely Cathedral (in full, The Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Ely) is the principal church of the Diocese of Ely, in Cambridgeshire, England, and is the seat of the Bishop of Ely and a suffragan bishop, the Bishop of Huntingdon. It is known locally as "the ship of the Fens", because of its prominent shape that towers above the surrounding flat and watery landscape.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Ely_Cathedral_3.jpg/250px-Ely_Cathedral_3.jpg
