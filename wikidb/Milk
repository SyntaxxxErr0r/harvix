147.1	Milk	Milk	Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to the baby and can reduce the risk of many diseases in the baby.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Human_Breastmilk_-_Foremilk_and_Hindmilk.png/220px-Human_Breastmilk_-_Foremilk_and_Hindmilk.png
