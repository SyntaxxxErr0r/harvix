79.5	Cinerama	Cinerama	Cinerama is the trademarked name for a widescreen process which works by simultaneously projecting images from three synchronized 35 mm projectors onto a huge, deeply-curved screen, subtending 146Â° of arc. It is also the trademarked name for the corporation which was formed to market it. It was the first of a number of such processes introduced during the 1950s, when the movie industry was reacting to competition from television. Cinerama was presented to the public as a theatrical event, with reserved seating and printed programs, and audience members often dressed in best attire for the evening.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/HowCineramaisprojected.gif/225px-HowCineramaisprojected.gif
