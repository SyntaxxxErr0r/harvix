153.6	Charles_I_of_England	Charles I of England	Charles I (19 November 1600 â€“ 30 January 1649) was King of England, King of Scotland, and King of Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649, and is a saint in the Church of England. Charles engaged in a struggle for power with the Parliament of England, attempting to obtain royal revenue whilst Parliament sought to curb his Royal prerogative which Charles believed was divinely ordained. Many of his English subjects opposed his actions, in particular his interference in the English and Scottish churches and the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, because they saw them as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Charles_I_as_Duke_of_York_and_Albany_Robert_Peake.jpg/170px-Charles_I_as_Duke_of_York_and_Albany_Robert_Peake.jpg
