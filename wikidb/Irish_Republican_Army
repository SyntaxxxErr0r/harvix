85.1	Irish_Republican_Army	Irish Republican Army	The Irish Republican Army (Irish: ) was an Irish republican revolutionary military organisation. It was descended from the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an organisation established on 25 November 1913 that staged the Easter Rising in April 1916. In 1919, the Irish Republic that had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising was formally established by an elected assembly (Dáil Éireann), and the Irish Volunteers were recognised by Dáil Éireann as its legitimate army. Thereafter, the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign against British rule in Ireland in the 1919–21 Irish War of Independence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Hogan%27s_Flying_Column.gif/300px-Hogan%27s_Flying_Column.gif
