108.7	Positron_emission_tomography	Positron emission tomography	Positron emission tomography is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional image or picture of functional processes in the body. The system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule. Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis. In modern scanners, three dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a CT X-ray scan performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/ECAT-Exact-HR--PET-Scanner.jpg/250px-ECAT-Exact-HR--PET-Scanner.jpg
