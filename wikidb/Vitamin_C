173.3	Vitamin_C	Vitamin C	Vitamin C or L-ascorbic acid or L-ascorbate is an essential nutrient for humans and certain other animal species. In living organisms ascorbate acts as an antioxidant by protecting the body against oxidative stress. It is also a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions including several collagen synthesis reactions that, when dysfunctional, cause the most severe symptoms of scurvy. In animals these reactions are especially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/L-Ascorbic_acid.svg/200px-L-Ascorbic_acid.svg.png
