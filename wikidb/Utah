255.5	Utah	Utah	Utah is a state in the Western United States. It became the 45th state admitted to the Union on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 10th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately 80% of Utah's 2,817,222 people live along the Wasatch Front, centering on Salt Lake City. This leaves vast expanses of the state nearly uninhabited, making the population the sixth most urbanized in the U.S. The name "Utah" is derived from the name of the Ute tribe and means "people of the mountains" in the Ute language. Utah is bordered by Arizona on the south, Colorado on the east, Wyoming on the northeast, Idaho on the north and Nevada on the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Flag_of_Utah.svg/125px-Flag_of_Utah.svg.png
