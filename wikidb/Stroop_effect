63.7	Stroop_effect	Stroop effect	In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of the reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue," "green," or "red") is printed in a color not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop who first published the effect in English in 1935. The effect had previously been published in Germany in 1929. The original paper has been one of the most cited papers in the history of experimental psychology, leading to more than 700 replications. The effect has been used to create a psychological test that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Stroop-fig1-exp2.jpg/220px-Stroop-fig1-exp2.jpg
