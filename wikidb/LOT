2.01	LOT	LOT Polish Airlines	Polskie Linie Lotnicze LOT S.A. , trading as LOT Polish Airlines, is the flag carrier of Poland. Based in Warsaw, LOT was established in 1929, making it one of the world's oldest airlines still in operation. Using a fleet of 55 aircraft, LOT operates a complex network to 60 destinations in Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Asia. Most of the destinations are served from its hub, Warsaw Chopin Airport. 1989 marked the beginning of the airline's quick development. LOT started retiring their old Soviet aircraft, and began their fleet renewal. With the arrival of the first Boeing 767-300ER, LOT started inter-continental services to Chicago, Newark, Toronto, and New York City. These four main routes have been one of the most popular flights that LOT operates, especially during the summer season when many Poles seek to come back to their homeland for vacation. The airline has a large short-haul service, with recently added destinations like Kaliningrad and Tbilisi, operating 20 E-Jet 170/175, and a recent order conversion to the E-195, will enable LOT to serve more destinations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/LOT_Polish_Airlines_logo.svg/250px-LOT_Polish_Airlines_logo.svg.png
