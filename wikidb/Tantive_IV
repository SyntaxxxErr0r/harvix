It was used by Leia Organa in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and was the first vessel audiences saw when Star Wars premiered in 1977. Other Corellian corvettes, which share the Tantive IV's design, appear in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi and in the Star Wars Expanded Universe's books, comics, and games.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/Tantive_IV.JPG/250px-Tantive_IV.JPG
