80.5	Desktop_environment	Desktop environment	In graphical computing, a desktop environment commonly refers to a particular implementation of graphical user interface (GUI) derived from the desktop metaphor that is seen on most modern personal computers. These GUIs help the user in easily accessing, configuring, and modifying many important and frequently accessed specific operating system (OS) features. The GUI usually does not afford access to all the many features found in an OS. Instead, the traditional command-line interface (CLI) is still used when full control over the OS is required in such cases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Gnome_3.2_shell.png/220px-Gnome_3.2_shell.png
