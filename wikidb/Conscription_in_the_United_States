73.8	Conscription_in_the_United_States	Conscription in the United States	Conscription in the United States has been employed several times, usually during war but also during the nominal peace of the Cold War. The United States discontinued the draft in 1973, moving to an all-volunteer military force, thus there is no mandatory conscription.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/170605-Draft-Registration.jpg/300px-170605-Draft-Registration.jpg
