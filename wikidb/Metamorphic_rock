54.6	Metamorphic_rock	Metamorphic rock	Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means "change in form". The original rock is subjected to heat and pressure, (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 Â°C and pressures of 1500 bars) causing profound physical and/or chemical change. The protolith may be sedimentary rock, igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Quartzite.jpg/200px-Quartzite.jpg
