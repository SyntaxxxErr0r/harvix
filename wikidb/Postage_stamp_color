3.01	Postage_stamp_color	Postage stamp color	The colors of postage stamps are at once obvious, and among the most difficult areas of philately. Different denominations of stamps have been printed in different colors since the very beginning; as with their successors, postal clerks could distinguish the Penny Black and Two pence blue more quickly by color than by reading the value, and the practice generally continues today. In practice, the actual color of a stamp may vary, and while collectors will pay high prices for rare shades, it may not be easy to tell those apart from variations caused by age, light, chemicals, and other factors. Stamp colors are routinely described by color name rather with any sort of a numerical system like CMYK; several color guides showing a selection of colors have been produced, but are not especially popular with collectors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/GB_Edward_VIII_Postage_Stamps.jpg/300px-GB_Edward_VIII_Postage_Stamps.jpg
