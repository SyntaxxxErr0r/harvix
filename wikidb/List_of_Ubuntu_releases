59.9	List_of_Ubuntu_releases	List of Ubuntu releases	Ubuntu releases are made semiannually by Canonical Ltd, the developers of the Ubuntu operating system, using the year and month of the release as a version number. The first Ubuntu release, for example, was Ubuntu 4.10 and was released on 20 October 2004. Consequently, version numbers for future versions are provisional; if the release is delayed until a different month to that planned, the version number changes accordingly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ubuntu_11.10_Final.png/220px-Ubuntu_11.10_Final.png
