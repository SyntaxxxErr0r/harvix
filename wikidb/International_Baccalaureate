60.1	International_Baccalaureate	International Baccalaureate	The International Baccalaureate , formerly the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO), is an international educational foundation headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and founded in 1968. IB offers three educational programmes for children ages 3â€“19. The organization's name and logo were changed in 2007 to reflect a new and for legal reorganization. Consequently, "IB" can refer to the organization itself, any of the three programmes, or the diploma or certificates awarded at the end of the diploma programme. IB is generally referred to as the Diploma program. This is incorrect and the IBO is moving to correct this global generalization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/IB_logo.gif/220px-IB_logo.gif
