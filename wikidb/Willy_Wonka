65.4	Willy_Wonka	Willy Wonka	Willy Wonka is a major character of Roald Dahl's 1964 children's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the film and theatrical adaptations that followed. The book and the 1971 film adaption both vividly depict an eccentric Wonka â€” a feature arising from his creative genius. He bewilders the other characters with his antics, but Charlie enjoys Wonka's behavior. In the 2005 film adaption, Willy Wonka's behavior is viewed more as a (sympathetic) character flaw.
