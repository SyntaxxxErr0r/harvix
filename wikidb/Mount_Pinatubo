89.0	Mount_Pinatubo	Mount Pinatubo	Mount Pinatubo is an active stratovolcano located on the island of Luzon, near the tripoint of the Philippine provinces of Zambales, Tarlac, and Pampanga. It is located in the Cabusilan Mountains separating the west coast of Luzon from the central plains. Before 1991, the mountain has no known recorded historical eruptions, its eruptive history unknown to most people. It was heavily eroded, inconspicuous and obscured from view. It was covered with dense forest which supported a population of several thousand indigenous people, the Aetas, who fled to the mountains during the Spanish conquest of the Philippines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Pinatubo91eruption_clark_air_base.jpg/280px-Pinatubo91eruption_clark_air_base.jpg
