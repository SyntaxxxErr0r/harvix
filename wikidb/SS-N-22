10.72	SS-N-22	SS-N-22	One of the SS-N-22s was the P-80 Zubr, designed by a team led by Vladimir Chelomei. The Zubr was rocket-propelled and armed with a 250 kilogram warhead. It was carried by early-model Sovremenny-class destroyers and Tarantul-class corvettes. The submarine-launched version of this missile was also designated as an SS-N-22 Sunburn by NATO but was known to the Soviets as the P-100 Oniks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Moskit_missile.jpg/250px-Moskit_missile.jpg
