78.0	Cloud_seeding	Cloud seeding	Cloud seeding, a form of intentional weather modification, is the attempt to change the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds, by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud. The usual intent is to increase precipitation (rain or snow), but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Cloud_Seeding.svg/500px-Cloud_Seeding.svg.png
