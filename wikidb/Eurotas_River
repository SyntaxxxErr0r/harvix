2.01	Eurotas_River	Eurotas (river)	The Eurotas or Evrotas (Greek: Ευρώτας) is the main river of Laconia prefecture and one of the major rivers of the Peloponnese, in Greece. The river's springs are located just northwest of the border between Laconia and the prefecture of Arcadia, at Skortsinos. The river is also fed by underwater springs at Pellana and by tributaries coursing down from Mt. Taygetos and Mt. Parnon, which flank the Eurotas valley to the west and east, respectively. The river is 82 kilometres (51 mi) long, flowing in a north-south direction and emptying into the Laconian Gulf.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Eyrwtas.PNG/288px-Eyrwtas.PNG
