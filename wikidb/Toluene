60.7	Toluene	Toluene	Toluene, formerly known as toluol, is a clear, water-insoluble liquid with the typical smell of paint thinners. It is a mono-substituted benzene derivative, i.e., one in which a single hydrogen atom from six groups of atoms from the benzene molecule has been replaced by a univalent group, in this case CH3.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Toluene-from-xtal-3D-balls.png/120px-Toluene-from-xtal-3D-balls.png
