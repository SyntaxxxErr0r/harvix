71.1	Civil_war	Civil war	A civil war is a war between organized groups within the same nation state or republic, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly-united nation state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region, or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin bellum civile which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Battle_of_Gettysburg.jpg/220px-Battle_of_Gettysburg.jpg
