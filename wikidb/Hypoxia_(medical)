108.1	Hypoxia_(medical)	Hypoxia (medical)	Hypoxia, or hypoxiation, is a pathological condition in which the body as a whole or a region of the body (tissue hypoxia) is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. Variations in arterial oxygen concentrations can be part of the normal physiology, for example, during strenuous physical exercise. A mismatch between oxygen supply and its demand at the cellular level may result in a hypoxic condition. Hypoxia in which there is complete deprivation of oxygen supply is referred to as anoxia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Cynosis.JPG/220px-Cynosis.JPG
