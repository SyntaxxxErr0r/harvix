101.6	Nutrient	Nutrient	A nutrient is a chemical that an organism needs to live and grow or a substance used in an organism's metabolism which must be taken in from its environment. They are used to build and repair tissues, regulate body processes and are converted to and used as energy. Methods for nutrient intake vary, with animals and protists consuming foods that are digested by an internal digestive system, but most plants ingest nutrients directly from the soil through their roots or from the atmosphere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Nutrient-cycle_hg.png/220px-Nutrient-cycle_hg.png
