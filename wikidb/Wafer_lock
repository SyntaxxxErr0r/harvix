2.00	Wafer_lock	Wafer tumbler lock	A wafer tumbler lock is a type of lock that uses a set of flat wafers to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. This type of lock is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin tumbler lock, the wafer is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Disc_tumbler_locked.png/220px-Disc_tumbler_locked.png
