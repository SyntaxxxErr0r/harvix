65.4	Reactive_oxygen_species	Reactive oxygen species	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. Examples include oxygen ions and peroxides. Reactive oxygen species are highly reactive due to the presence of unpaired valence shell electrons. ROS form as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signaling and homeostasis. However, during times of environmental stress (e.g., UV or heat exposure), ROS levels can increase dramatically. This may result in significant damage to cell structures. Cumulatively, this is known as oxidative stress. ROS are also generated by exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Major_cellular_sources_of_Reactive_Oxygen_Species_in_living_cells.jpg/220px-Major_cellular_sources_of_Reactive_Oxygen_Species_in_living_cells.jpg
