69.8	Inklings	Inklings	The Inklings was an informal literary discussion group associated with the University of Oxford, England, for nearly two decades between the early 1930s and late 1949. The Inklings were literary enthusiasts who praised the value of narrative in fiction, and encouraged the writing of fantasy. Although Christian values were notably present in several members' work, there were also irreligious members of the discussion group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Eagle_and_Child_%28interior%29.jpg/300px-Eagle_and_Child_%28interior%29.jpg
