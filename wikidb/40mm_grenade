2.00	40mm_grenade	40mm grenade	The 40mm grenade is a military grenade caliber for grenade launchers in service with many armed forces. There are two main types in service: the 40×46mm, which is a low-velocity round used in hand-held grenade launchers; and the high-velocity 40×53mm, used in mounted and crew-served weapons. The cartridges are not interchangeable. Both 40mm cartridges use what the US Army during the Vietnam War called the High-Low Propulsion System.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/M32_Grenade_Loading.jpg/220px-M32_Grenade_Loading.jpg
