At the time, U.S. senators were elected by state legislatures; thus Lincoln and Douglas were trying for their respective parties to win control of the Illinois legislature. The debates previewed the issues that Lincoln would face in the aftermath of his victory in the 1860 presidential election. The main issue discussed in all seven debates was slavery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Abraham_Lincoln_1860.jpg/165px-Abraham_Lincoln_1860.jpg
