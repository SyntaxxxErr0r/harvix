62.9	Claudius	Claudius	Claudius (Latin: Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus; 1 August 10 BC â€“ 13 October AD 54), was Roman Emperor from 41 to 54. A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was the son of Drusus and Antonia Minor. He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul and was the first Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37. Claudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared Emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last adult male of his family.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Claudius_%28M.A.N._Madrid%29_01.jpg/220px-Claudius_%28M.A.N._Madrid%29_01.jpg
