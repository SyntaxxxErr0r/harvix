Completed in 1883, it connects the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River. With a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m), it was the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and the first steel-wire suspension bridge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Brooklyn_Bridge_Postdlf.jpg/280px-Brooklyn_Bridge_Postdlf.jpg
