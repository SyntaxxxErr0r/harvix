3.21	Visual_Arts	Visual arts	The visual arts are art forms that create works which are primarily visual in nature, such as ceramics, drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking, design, crafts, and often modern visual arts and architecture. These definitions should not be taken too strictly as many artistic disciplines (performing arts, conceptual art, textile arts) involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types. Also included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design and decorative art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/L%27%C3%A9glise_d%27Auvers-sur-Oise.jpg/250px-L%27%C3%A9glise_d%27Auvers-sur-Oise.jpg
