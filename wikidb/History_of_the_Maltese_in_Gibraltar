Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus were the three stepping stones whereby Great Britain controlled the Mediterranean and the vital route to the Suez Canal and thence to India. When the British conquered Gibraltar, the majority of the inhabitants fled and sought refuge principally in the nearby Spanish town of San Roque, leaving behind a place to be taken by immigrants, mostly from Malta and Genoa. Immigration from neighboring Spanish towns soon followed giving the colony a very cosmopolitan population. Years of coexistence and intermarriage on the colony soon led to a coalescence of Maltese, Italian and Andalusian culture, preserving the Mediterranean and Catholic uniqueness of the colony despite centuries of British occupation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Malta.svg/100px-Flag_of_Malta.svg.png
