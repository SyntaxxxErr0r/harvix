Directed by Peter Shin and written by series creator Seth MacFarlane, the episode was first broadcast on May 1, 2005, on FOX, though it had premiered three days earlier at a special screening at the University of Vermont, Burlington. In "North by North Quahog", the show's main characters Peter and Lois Griffin go on a second honeymoon to spice up their marriage, but are eventually chased by Mel Gibson after Peter steals the sequel to The Passion of the Christ from Gibson's private hotel room. Meanwhile, their anthropomorphic dog Brian and their infant son Stewie take care of their teenage kids Chris and Meg.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Seth_MacFarlane_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg/150px-Seth_MacFarlane_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg
