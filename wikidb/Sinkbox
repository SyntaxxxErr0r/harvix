1.00	Sinkbox	Sinkbox	A sinkbox is a specialized hunting blind used by waterfowl hunters and consisting of a weighted, partially submerged enclosure large enough to hold one or more hunters and suspended from a floating platform. It is placed into calm water in locations where the chosen game bird is likely to appear, and the hunter waits, with the waterline at approximately shoulder height, until the birds are close to the sinkbox.
