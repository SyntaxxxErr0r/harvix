12.60	Runic_magic	Runic magic	There is some evidence that, in addition to being a writing system, runes historically served purposes of magic.

An erilaz appears to have been a person versed in runes, including their magic applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Brakteat_von_Djupbrunns.jpg/220px-Brakteat_von_Djupbrunns.jpg
