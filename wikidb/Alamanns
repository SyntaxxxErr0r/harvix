1.00	Alamanns	Alemanni	The Alemanni (also Alamanni, Alamani) were a confederation Suebian Germanic tribes located on the upper Rhine river. First mentioned by the Romans in 213, the Alamanni captured the Agri Decumates in 260, and later expanded into present-day Alsace, and northern Switzerland, establishing the German language in those regions. In 496, the Alamanni were conquered by Frankish leader Clovis and incorporated into his dominions. The legacy of the Alamanni survives in the Names of Germany in several languages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Alemanni_expansion.png/320px-Alemanni_expansion.png
