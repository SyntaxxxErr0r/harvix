19.02	Sanguine	Sanguine	Sanguine or red chalk is chalk of a reddish-brown colour, so called because it resembles the colour of dried blood. It has been popular for centuries for drawing (where white chalk only works on coloured paper), and the term also describes a drawing done in sanguine. The word comes via French from the Italian sanguina.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/L%27Image_et_le_Pouvoir_-_Etude_d%27apr%C3%A8s_un_buste_romain.jpg/220px-L%27Image_et_le_Pouvoir_-_Etude_d%27apr%C3%A8s_un_buste_romain.jpg
