18.20	Mittelafrika	Mittelafrika	Mittelafrika is the name created for a geostrategic region in central and east Africa. Much like Mitteleuropa, it articulated Germany's foreign policy aim, prior to World War I, of bringing the region under German domination. The difference being that Mittelafrika would presumably be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a6/Mittelafrika2.PNG/220px-Mittelafrika2.PNG
