55.1	Peter_Popoff	Peter Popoff	Peter Popoff (born July 2, 1946) is a televangelist and self-proclaimed prophet and faith healer. He conducts revival meetings and has a national television program. He initially rose to prominence in the 1980s. He went bankrupt in 1987 after skeptics James Randi and Alexander (Alec) Jason exposed his method of receiving information about revival attendees from his wife via an in-ear receiver. According to Fred M. Frohock, "the case of Peter Popoff is one of many egregious instances of fake healing". Popoff has since returned to public ministry.
