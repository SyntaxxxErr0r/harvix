55.1	Soy_milk	Soy milk	Soy milk (also called soya milk, soymilk, soybean milk, or soy bean juice) and sometimes referred to as soy drink/beverage is a beverage made from soybeans. A traditional staple of Chinese and Japanese cuisine, it is a stable emulsion of oil, water, and protein. It is produced by soaking dry soybeans and grinding them with water. Soy milk contains about the same proportion of protein as cow's milk: around 3.5%; also 2% fat, 2.9% carbohydrate, and 0.5% ash. Soy milk can be made at home with traditional kitchen tools or with a soy milk machine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Soymilk_can_and_glass_2.jpg/220px-Soymilk_can_and_glass_2.jpg
