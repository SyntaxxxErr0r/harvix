7.30	New_Zealand_Special_Air_Service	New Zealand Special Air Service	The New Zealand Special Air Service was formed on 7 July 1955 and is a special forces unit of the New Zealand Army modelled on the British Special Air Service (SAS). The New Zealand Government states that NZ SAS is the "premier combat unit of the New Zealand Defence Force". Its key roles are to undertake overseas missions and respond to domestic terrorist attacks. The New Zealand SAS is held in high regard internationally, as demonstrated by the United States Presidential Citation which was awarded to the NZSAS on 7 December 2004.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Uk-sas.svg/150px-Uk-sas.svg.png
