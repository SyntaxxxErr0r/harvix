56.0	Orgasm	Orgasm	Orgasm (from Greek οργασμός orgasmos, from organ to mature, swell, also sexual climax) is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by an intense sensation of pleasure. Experienced by males and females, orgasms are controlled by the involuntary, or autonomic, limbic system. They are often associated with other involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations are expressed. The period after orgasm (known as a refractory period) is often a relaxing experience, attributed to the release of the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Podkowi%C5%84ski-Sza%C5%82_uniesie%C5%84-MNK.jpg/225px-Podkowi%C5%84ski-Sza%C5%82_uniesie%C5%84-MNK.jpg
