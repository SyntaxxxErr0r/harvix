189.4	Austrian_School	Austrian School	The Austrian School of economics is a school of economic thought which advocates methodological individualism and a deductive approach to economics called praxeology. It is therefore critical of econometrics and the application of empirical research in economic theory, which are commonly used in mainstream economics. It also advocates the theory that money is non-neutral, the theory that interest rates and profits are determined by the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing marginal productivity of time and time preferences, the theory that the capital structure of economies consists of heterogeneous goods that have multispecific uses which must be aligned , and it emphasizes the organizing power of the price mechanism (see economic calculation debate). Austrian School views are considered heterodox and mainstream economists are generally critical of its methodology. Austrian economists are generally advocates of laissez-faire policies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Jean-baptiste_Say.jpg/130px-Jean-baptiste_Say.jpg
