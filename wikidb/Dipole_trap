1.00	Dipole_trap	Dipole trap	A dipole trap (sometimes and optical dipole trap, or ODT) is a system in which a laser (or two lasers) are used to confine an individual atom or cloud of atoms for study. Dipole traps rely on the strong electric field of the laser inducing a dipole moment in the atoms, which subsequently interacts with the electric field. For red-detuned dipole traps (where the laser frequency is less than the atomic resonance frequency), this arrangement causes the atoms to be attracted towards regions of high laser intensity, while blue-detuned traps cause the atoms to seek low-intensity regions.
