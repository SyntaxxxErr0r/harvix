82.1	Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom	Presidential Medal of Freedom	The Presidential Medal of Freedom is an award bestowed by the President of the United States and is—along with the comparable Congressional Gold Medal bestowed by an act of U.S. Congress—the highest civilian award in the United States. It recognizes those individuals who have made "an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors". The award is not limited to U.S. citizens and, while it is a civilian award, it can also be awarded to military personnel and worn on the uniform.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/PresMedalFreedom.jpg/150px-PresMedalFreedom.jpg
