3.00	Lizzie_Miller	Plus-size model	Plus-size model is a term applied to a person who is engaged primarily in modeling plus-size clothing. Plus-size models also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., stock photography and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Robyn_Lawley.JPG/220px-Robyn_Lawley.JPG
