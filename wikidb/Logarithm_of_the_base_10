1.00	Logarithm_of_the_base_10	Common logarithm	The common logarithm is the logarithm with base 10. It is also known as the decadic logarithm, named after its base, and Briggsian logarithm, after Henry Briggs, an English mathematician who pioneered its use. It is indicated by log10 , or sometimes Log(x) with a capital L (however, this notation is ambiguous since it can also mean the complex natural logarithmic multi-valued function). On calculators it is usually "log", but mathematicians usually mean natural logarithm rather than common logarithm when they write "log". To mitigate this ambiguity the ISO specification is that log10(x) should be lg (x) and loge(x) should be ln (x).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Graph_of_common_logarithm.png/400px-Graph_of_common_logarithm.png
