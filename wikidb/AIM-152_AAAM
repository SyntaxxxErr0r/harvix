1.00	AIM-152_AAAM	AIM-152 AAAM	The AIM-152 AAAM is a long-range air-to-air missile developed by the United States of America. The program went through a protracted development stage but was never adopted by the United States Air Force, due to the ending of the cold war and the reduction in threat of its perceived primary target Soviet Union supersonic bombers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/AIM-152_AAAM.svg/310px-AIM-152_AAAM.svg.png
