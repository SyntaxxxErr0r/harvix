99.5	Bill_Richardson	Bill Richardson	William Blaine "Bill" Richardson III (born November 15, 1947) is an American politician, who served as the 30th Governor of New Mexico from 2003 to 2011. Before being elected governor, Richardson served in the Clinton administration as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and Energy Secretary. Richardson has also served as a U.S. Congressman, chairman of the 2004 Democratic National Convention, and chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. On December 3, 2008, then-President-elect Barack Obama designated Richardson for appointment to the cabinet-level position of Commerce Secretary. On January 4, 2009, Richardson announced his decision to withdraw his nomination because of an investigation into possibly improper business dealings in New Mexico. In August 2009, federal prosecutors dropped the pending investigation against the governor, and there was speculation in the media regarding Richardson's career, as his second and final term as New Mexico governor concluded.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Bill_Richardson_at_an_event_in_Kensington%2C_New_Hampshire%2C_March_18%2C_2006.jpg/220px-Bill_Richardson_at_an_event_in_Kensington%2C_New_Hampshire%2C_March_18%2C_2006.jpg
