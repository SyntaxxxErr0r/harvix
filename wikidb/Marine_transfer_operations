1.00	Marine_transfer_operations	Marine transfer operations	Marine Transfer Operations are conducted at many ports around the world between tanker ships, barges, and marine terminals. Specifically, once the marine vessel is secure at the dock a loading arm or transfer hose is connected between a valve header on the dock and the manifold header on the vessel. A marine transfer of petroleum products cannot be conducted unless it is supervised by a person-in-charge (PIC) on the vessel who is seafarer in the Merchant Marine and another person-in-charge on the dock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Tanker_unloading_crude_oil.jpg/300px-Tanker_unloading_crude_oil.jpg
