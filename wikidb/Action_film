72.6	Action_film	Action film	Action film is a film genre where one or more heroes is thrust into a series of challenges that require physical feats, extended fights and frenetic chases. They occasionally have a resourceful character struggling against incredible odds such as, life-threatening situations, an evil villain, and/or being chased in several ways of transportation (car, bus, truck, etc.), with victory achieved at the end after difficult physical efforts and violence. Story and character development are generally secondary to explosions, fist fights, gunplay and car chases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Action_film_actors.jpeg/350px-Action_film_actors.jpeg
