It consisted of the small United States Army (the regular army), augmented by massive numbers of units supplied by the Northern states, composed of volunteers as well as conscripts. The Union Army fought and eventually defeated the smaller Confederate States Army during the war which lasted from 1861 to 1865. About 360,000 died from all causes; some 280,000 were wounded.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Michigan_infantry.jpg/300px-Michigan_infantry.jpg
