The first settlement of the Plymouth Colony was at New Plymouth, a location previously surveyed and named by Captain John Smith. The settlement, which served as the capital of the colony, is today the modern town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. At its height, Plymouth Colony occupied most of the southeastern portion of the modern state of Massachusetts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Plymouth_Colony_map.svg/250px-Plymouth_Colony_map.svg.png
