60.4	Diaper	Diaper	A nappy (in Commonwealth English) or a diaper (in American English) is a kind of underwear that allows one to defecate or urinate on oneself discreetly. When diapers become soiled, they require changing; this process is often performed by a second person such as a parent or caregiver. Failure to change a diaper on a regular enough basis can result in diaper rash.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Disposablediaper.JPG/200px-Disposablediaper.JPG
