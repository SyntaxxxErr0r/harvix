1.00	CFIT-FM	CFIT-FM	CFIT-FM is a Canadian radio station that broadcasts an adult top 40 format at 106.1 FM in Airdrie, Alberta and its transmitter 91.5 FM in Cochrane. The station, which officially signed on April 12, 2007 as The Range, is branded as Air 106-1 and is currently owned by Golden West Broadcasting. It played more rock than its rival, CHFM-FM (Lite 95-9), but still plays soft rock and pre-1979 titles unlike its CHFM-FM rival. The Range's launch in 2007 marked it the first time Calgary began having two adult contemporary radio stations on FM.
