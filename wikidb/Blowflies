2.20	Blowflies	Calliphoridae	Calliphoridae (commonly known as blow-flies, carrion flies, bluebottles, greenbottles, or cluster flies) are insects in the Order Diptera, family Calliphoridae. The family is known to be non-monophyletic, but much remains disputed regarding proper treatment of the constituent units, some of which are occasionally accorded family status (e.g., Bengaliidae, Helicoboscidae, Polleniidae, Rhiniidae).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Chrysomya_megacephala_male.jpg/250px-Chrysomya_megacephala_male.jpg
