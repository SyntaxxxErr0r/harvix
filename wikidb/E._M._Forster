104.5	E._M._Forster	E. M. Forster	Edward Morgan Forster OM, CH (1 January 1879 â€“ 7 June 1970) was an English novelist, short story writer, essayist and librettist. He is known best for his ironic and well-plotted novels examining class difference and hypocrisy in early 20th-century British society. Forster's humanistic impulse toward understanding and sympathy may be aptly summed up in the epigraph to his 1910 novel Howards End: "Only connect."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/E._M._Forster_von_Dora_Carrington%2C_1924-25.jpg/200px-E._M._Forster_von_Dora_Carrington%2C_1924-25.jpg
