266.5	Diabetes	Diabetes mellitus	Diabetes mellitus, often simply referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced. This high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Blue_circle_for_diabetes.svg/230px-Blue_circle_for_diabetes.svg.png
