52.7	Ico	Ico	Ico Iko, English pronunciation: ) is an action-adventure game developed by Team Ico and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001 and 2002 across various regions. It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a "boy meets girl" concept. Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a "subtracting design" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/70/Box-l-jp.jpg/256px-Box-l-jp.jpg
