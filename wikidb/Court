65.4	Court	Court	A court is a form of tribunal, often a governmental institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Old_Bailey_Microcosm_edited.jpg/250px-Old_Bailey_Microcosm_edited.jpg
