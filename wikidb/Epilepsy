134.4	Epilepsy	Epilepsy	Epilepsy (from the Ancient Greek ἐπιληψία — "seizure") is a common and diverse set of chronic neurological disorders characterized by seizures. Some definitions of epilepsy require that seizures be recurrent and unprovoked, but others require only a single seizure combined with brain alterations which increase the chance of future seizures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Spike-waves.png/230px-Spike-waves.png
