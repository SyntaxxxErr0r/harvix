54.4	John_Bell_Hood	John Bell Hood	John Bell Hood (June 1 or June 29, 1831 â€“ August 30, 1879) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War. Hood had a reputation for bravery and aggressiveness that sometimes bordered on recklessness. Arguably one of the best brigade and division commanders in the Confederate States Army, Hood became increasingly ineffective as he was promoted to lead larger, independent commands late in the war, and his career was marred by his decisive defeats leading an army in the Atlanta Campaign and the Franklin-Nashville Campaign.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Lt._Gen._John_B._Hood.jpg/240px-Lt._Gen._John_B._Hood.jpg
