13.23	Naco_(slang)	Naco (slang)	Naco is a pejorative word often used in Mexican Spanish to describe the bad-mannered and poorly educated people of lower social classes. It is equivalent to 'white trash' in American English and culture. While in Nahuatl language the word "naka" means "flesh" or "people", the Aztecs preferred the word "tlaca" to refer to people and "naka" is almost confined to refer to meat. It is erroneous to believe that "Naco" and "naka" are related. "Naco" is an apocope derived from the nahuatl word "nacayote", "najayote" or "nejayote", waste water derived from corn processing (nixtamal) which was sarcastically compared by Aztecs to drool. Therefore, a "nacayote" was originally a slobbering (i.e., stupid) person. During the 20th century the word became shortened to "naco" and shifted its meaning from stupidity to ignorance. A naco is usually associated with lower socio-economic classes and/or the indigenous, but it also includes the nouveau-riche.
