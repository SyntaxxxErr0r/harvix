It was a non-aggression pact under which the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany each pledged to remain neutral in the event that either nation were attacked by a third party. It remained in effect until 22 June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/MolotovRibbentropStalin.jpg/250px-MolotovRibbentropStalin.jpg
