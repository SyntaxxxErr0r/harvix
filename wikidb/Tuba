57.1	Tuba	Tuba	The tuba is the largest and lowest-pitched brass instrument. Sound is produced by vibrating or "buzzing" the lips into a large cupped mouthpiece. It is one of the most recent additions to the modern symphony orchestra, first appearing in the mid-19th century, when it largely replaced the ophicleide . Tuba is Latin for trumpet or horn. The horn referred to would most likely resemble what is known as a baroque trumpet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Two_F_tubas.jpg/250px-Two_F_tubas.jpg
