1.00	Rokstone	Rök Runestone	The Rök Runestone is one of the most famous runestones, featuring the longest known runic inscription in stone. It can now be seen by the church in Rök (between Mjölby and Ödeshög, close to the E4 and Lake Vättern and Tåkern), Östergötland, Sweden. It is considered the first piece of written Swedish literature and thus it marks the beginning of the history of Swedish literature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/R%C3%B6kstenen.jpg/250px-R%C3%B6kstenen.jpg
