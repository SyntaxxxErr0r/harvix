2.02	Hanxin	Hanxin	Hanxin is the name of a digital signal processing (DSP) microchip. A Chinese professor, Chen Jin, claimed to have developed the chip in 2003. Chen Jin was a professor at the prestigious Jiaotong University in Shanghai. The Hanxin 1 was reportedly the first DSP chip to have been wholly developed in China; however, the chip was later revealed to be a duplicate of a chip developed in the West, with the original identifications sanded away.
