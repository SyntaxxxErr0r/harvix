56.7	Polysaccharide	Polysaccharide	Polysaccharides are long carbohydrate molecules of repeated monomer units joined together by glycosidic bonds. They range in structure from linear to highly branched. Polysaccharides are often quite heterogeneous, containing slight modifications of the repeating unit. Depending on the structure, these macromolecules can have distinct properties from their monosaccharide building blocks. They may be amorphous or even insoluble in water.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Cellulose-Ibeta-from-xtal-2002-3D-balls.png/250px-Cellulose-Ibeta-from-xtal-2002-3D-balls.png
