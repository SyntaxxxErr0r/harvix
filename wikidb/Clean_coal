77.4	Clean_coal	Clean coal	Historically used to refer to technologies for reducing emissions of ash, sulfur, and heavy metals from coal combustion; the term is now commonly used to refer to carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Clean coal is an umbrella term used primarily to describe technologies that may reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas that arise from the burning of coal for electrical power. Typically, clean coal is used by coal companies in reference to carbon capture and storage, which pumps and stores CO2 emissions underground, and to plants using an Integrated gasification combined cycle which gasifies coal to reduce CO2 emissions.
