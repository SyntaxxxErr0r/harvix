93.7	Boeing_787	Boeing 787 Dreamliner	The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-range, mid-size wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It seats 210 to 290 passengers, depending on the variant. Boeing states that it is the company's most fuel-efficient airliner and the world's first major airliner to use composite materials for most of its construction. The 787 consumes 20% less fuel than the similarly-sized 767. Its distinguishing features include a four-panel windshield, noise-reducing chevrons on its engine nacelles, and a smoother nose contour. The 787 shares a common type rating with the larger 777 twinjet, allowing qualified pilots to operate both models, due to related design features.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/All_Nippon_Airways_Boeing_787-8_Dreamliner_JA801A_OKJ_in_flight.jpg/300px-All_Nippon_Airways_Boeing_787-8_Dreamliner_JA801A_OKJ_in_flight.jpg
