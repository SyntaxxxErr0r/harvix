53.8	Anthropomorphic	Anthropomorphism	Anthropomorphism is any attribution of human characteristics (or characteristics assumed to belong only to humans) to animals, non-living things, phenomena, material states, objects or abstract concepts, such as organizations, governments, spirits or deities. The term was coined in the mid 1700s. Examples include animals and plants and forces of nature such as winds, rain or the sun depicted as creatures with human motivations, and/or the abilities to reason and converse. The term derives from the combination of the Greek , "human" and (), "shape" or "form".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/The_North_Wind_and_the_Sun_-_Wind_-_Project_Gutenberg_etext_19994.jpg/220px-The_North_Wind_and_the_Sun_-_Wind_-_Project_Gutenberg_etext_19994.jpg
