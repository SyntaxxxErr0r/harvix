98.1	Temple_in_Jerusalem	Temple in Jerusalem	The Temple in Jerusalem or Holy Temple was one of a series of structures which were historically located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, the current site of the Dome of the Rock. Historically, these successive temples stood at this location and functioned as the centre of ancient Israelite and later Jewish worship. According to classical Jewish belief, the Temple acted as the figurative "footstool" of God's presence and a Third Temple will be built there in the future.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Jerusalem_Modell_BW_2.JPG/275px-Jerusalem_Modell_BW_2.JPG
