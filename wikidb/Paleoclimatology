51.0	Paleoclimatology	Paleoclimatology	Paleoclimatology (also palaeoclimatology) is the study of changes in climate taken on the scale of the entire history of Earth. It uses a variety of proxy methods from the Earth and life sciences to obtain data previously preserved within rocks, sediments, ice sheets, tree rings, corals, shells and microfossils; it then uses these records to determine the past states of the Earth's various climate regions and its atmospheric system. Paleoclimatology has wider implications for climate change today. Scientists often consider past changes in environment and biodiversity to reflect on the current situation, and specifically the impact of climate on mass extinctions and biotic recovery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/All_palaeotemps.png/900px-All_palaeotemps.png
