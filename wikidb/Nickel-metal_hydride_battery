56.6	Nickel-metal_hydride_battery	Nickel–metal hydride battery	A nickel–metal hydride cell, abbreviated NiMH or Ni-MH, is a type of rechargeable battery. It is very similar to the nickel–cadmium cell (NiCd). NiMH use positive electrodes of nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), like the NiCd, but the negative electrode uses a hydrogen-absorbing alloy instead of cadmium. A NiMH battery can have two to three times the capacity of an equivalent size NiCd, and their energy density approaches that of a lithium-ion cell.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/NiMH_2500mAh.jpg/150px-NiMH_2500mAh.jpg
