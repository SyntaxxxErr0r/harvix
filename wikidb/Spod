4.30	Spod	Spod	Spod refers to an avid user of Internet talkers, a type of online chat system. Less frequently, it may be applied to those who use MUDs as if they were talkers. The spod tends to be something of a long-term fanatic, and many have been using the same talker for a decade or more. Talkers are related to MUDs, but are significantly easier to run, since they do not incorporate gameplay features, and they are usually much more user friendly.
