3.00	Change_of_decay_rate	Radioactive decay	Radioactive decay is the process by which an atomic nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting ionizing particles . There are many different types of radioactive decay (see table below). A decay, or loss of energy, results when an atom with one type of nucleus, called the parent radionuclide, transforms to an atom with a nucleus in a different state, or a different nucleus, either of which is named the daughter nuclide. Often the parent and daughter are different chemical elements, and in such cases the decay process results in nuclear transmutation. In an example of this, a carbon-14 atom (the "parent") emits radiation (a beta particle, electron antineutrino, and a gamma ray) and transforms to a nitrogen-14 atom (the "daughter"). By contrast, there exist two types of radioactive decay processes (gamma decay and internal conversion decay) that do not result in transmutation or emission of neutrinos, but only decrease the energy of an excited nucleus. This results in an atom of the same element as before, but with a nucleus in a lower energy state.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Alpha_Decay.svg/220px-Alpha_Decay.svg.png
