64.0	American_Old_West	American Old West	The American Old West, or the Wild West, comprises the history, geography, people, folklore, and cultural expression of life on the American frontier and in the Western United States, most often referring to the latter half of the 19th century, between the California Gold Rush of 1849 and the end of the century. After the 18th century and the push beyond the Appalachian Mountains, the term is generally applied to anywhere west of the Mississippi River in earlier periods and westward from the frontier strip toward the later part of the 19th century. Thus, the Midwest and American South, though no longer considered "western" have a frontier heritage along with the modern western states.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Grabill_-_The_Cow_Boy-edit.jpg/200px-Grabill_-_The_Cow_Boy-edit.jpg
