1.10	Wasp_Major	Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major	The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major was a large 28-cylinder supercharged air-cooled four-row radial piston aircraft engine designed and built during World War II. It was the last of the Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp family and the culmination of its maker's piston engine technology, but the war was over before it could power airplanes into combat. It did, however, power the last generation of large piston-engined aircraft before the turbojet and turboprop took over.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Pratt_%26_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major.jpg/300px-Pratt_%26_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major.jpg
