1.00	Hyphenated	Hyphen	The hyphen ( ) is a punctuation mark used to join words and to separate syllables of a single word. The use of hyphens is called hyphenation. The hyphen should not be confused with dashes ( , –, —, ― ), which are longer and have different uses, or with the minus sign ( − ) which is also longer. However, in environments that are restricted to ISO 646, and often in computing generally, the hyphen is represented by a hyphen-minus ( - ), which is well known and easy to enter on keyboards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Adobe_Caslon_a.svg/114px-Adobe_Caslon_a.svg.png
