12.00	Casting_on_(knitting)	Casting on (knitting)	In knitting, casting on is a family of techniques for adding new stitches that do not depend on earlier stitches, i.e., stitches having an independent lower edge. In principle, casting on is the opposite of binding off, but the techniques involved are generally unrelated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Caston.jpg/220px-Caston.jpg
