54.9	Tipi	Tipi	A tipi (also tepee and teepee) is a Lakota name for a conical tent traditionally made of animal skins and wooden poles used by the nomadic tribes and sedentary tribal dwellers (when hunting) of the Great Plains. Tipis are stereotypically associated with Native Americans in general but Native Americans from places other than the Great Plains mostly used different types of dwellings. The term "wigwam" (a domed structure) is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to a tipi.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Oglala_girl_in_front_of_a_tipi2.jpg/271px-Oglala_girl_in_front_of_a_tipi2.jpg
