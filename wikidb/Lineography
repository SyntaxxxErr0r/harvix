2.00	Lineography	Lineography	Lineography is the art of drawing without lifting the pen, pencil, or paintbrush that is being used. The practice originated in France in the seventeenth century and had fallen into disuse by the early nineteenth century. In some instances, entire landscapes and still lifes have been drawn or painted using this lineographic technique. There are also examples of famous works of art, such as the Mona Lisa being reproduced in this way.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Lineographic_Dauphin_Coat_of_Arms.jpg/250px-Lineographic_Dauphin_Coat_of_Arms.jpg
