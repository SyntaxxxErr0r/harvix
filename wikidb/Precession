66.7	Precession	Precession	Precession is a change in the orientation of the rotation axis of a rotating body. It can be defined as a change in direction of the rotation axis in which the second Euler angle is constant. In physics, there are two types of precession: torque-free and torque-induced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Gyroscope_precession.gif/220px-Gyroscope_precession.gif
