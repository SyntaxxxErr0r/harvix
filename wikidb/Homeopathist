1.00	Homeopathist	Homeopathy	Homeopathy (also spelled homoeopathy or homœopathy; from the Greek hómoios- - "like-" + páthos "suffering" ) is a form of alternative medicine. Practitioners treat patients using highly diluted preparations from constituents believed to cause symptoms in healthy individuals similar to the undesired symptoms of the person treated. Scientific evidence has found homeopathy no more effective than a placebo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Hahnemann.jpg/220px-Hahnemann.jpg
