6.11	Hugging	Hug	A hug is a form of physical intimacy, that usually involves closing or holding the arms around the neck, back, or waist of another person; if more than two persons are involved, this is referred to as a group hug. A hug, sometimes in association with a kiss, eye contact or other gestures, is a form of nonverbal communication. Depending on culture, context and relationship, a hug can indicate familiarity, love, affection, or friendship. One person may hug another as an indication of support, comfort, and consolation. A hug can be a demonstration of affection and emotional warmth, sometimes arising out of joy or happiness at meeting someone or seeing someone that they have not seen in a long time. Sometimes hugs are a romantic exchange.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lebr03.jpg/220px-Lebr03.jpg
