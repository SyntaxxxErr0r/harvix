63.1	Webmail	Webmail	Although every email service provider can read the email unless encrypted since it is stored on their servers, concerns have been raised about webmail specifically. Most popular webmail services tend to use what's called targeting ads and online spam-filter(instead of a client-based), these services searches through email for certain target words and even if the service providers claim that no humans reads the emails some of them have been forced to make it possible to opt this feature out. Because web browser is the expected way of viewing the inbox webmail providers store emails longer than usual providers which often delete the email from their servers after they have sent it to the email client.
