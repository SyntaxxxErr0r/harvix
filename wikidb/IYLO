The slogan used by the clients Phoenix Logistics and E3 Property International is Inspiration For Life. The building, once finished, will feature 20 floors of apartments and a roof height of 61 metres (200 ft). The tower is elliptical in plan comprising two equal halves which 'slide' past one another. The architects of the building are Darling Associates Architecture, with a number of other firms working on IYLO including Phoenix Logistics Limited, E3 Property International Ltd., Lancsville Construction Ltd., Jones Lang LaSalle, Matthew Consultants, Macfarlane Wilder, Scott Wilson, Scott Wilson, Cole Jarman Associates, dp9 and Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated. The tower is part of the Croydon Vision 2020 regeneration plan for Croydon to add to its goal of being London's Third City. It is due to be completed in Summer 2012 However, this now seems unlikely given that work stopped on the construction project in June 2011, following the construction company, St James's Croydon, a subsidiary of developers Phoenix Logistics entering administration. . By March 2012 the site is showing increasing signs of vandalism and graffiti.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/IYLO_TQ3266_039.JPG/220px-IYLO_TQ3266_039.JPG
