71.2	Cogito_ergo_sum	Cogito ergo sum	(French: "Je pense donc je suis"; English: "I think, therefore I am") is a philosophical Latin statement proposed by . The simple meaning of the phrase is that someone wondering whether or not he or she exists is, in and of itself, proof that something, an "I", exists to do the thinking â€” However this "I" is not the more or less permanent person we call "I". It may be that the something that thinks is purely momentary, and not the same as the something which has a different thought the next moment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Descartes-moncornet.jpg/140px-Descartes-moncornet.jpg
