It forms the first part of the Inmost Light trilogy; the second being 1996's All The Pretty Little Horses: The Inmost Light and the last being 1996's The Starres Are Marching Sadly Home (Theinmostlightthirdandfinal). The piece consists of David Tibet's spoken and whispered vocals over eerie noises and the "long shadows" loop, which is sampled from a recording of Alessandro Moreschi, the only castrato who made recordings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Where_The_Long_Shadow_Falls_1995.jpg/220px-Where_The_Long_Shadow_Falls_1995.jpg
