100.3	Passive_house	Passive house	The term passive house (Passivhaus in German) refers to the rigorous, voluntary, Passivhaus standard for energy efficiency in a building, reducing its ecological footprint. It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, MINERGIE-P, is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard. Passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design, but a design process that is integrated with architectural design. Although it is mostly applied to new buildings, it has also been used for refurbishments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Passivhaus_Darmstadt_Kranichstein_Fruehling_2006.JPG/300px-Passivhaus_Darmstadt_Kranichstein_Fruehling_2006.JPG
