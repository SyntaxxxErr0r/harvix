3.00	Taste_of_Home	Taste of Home	Taste of Home magazine is an American cooking publication, founded by Roy Reiman, publisher of Reiman Publications, and currently owned by The Reader's Digest Association, which purchased Reiman Publications in 2002. The magazine was first published in 1993. It specializes in recipe exchange and Midwestern cuisine. Taste of Home used to be dependent entirely on subscriber revenue for its income, taking no advertising. However, in Fall 2007, the magazine began including advertising (as noted by the editors in the December 2007 issue).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/ff/Taste_of_home_magazine_cover.png/220px-Taste_of_home_magazine_cover.png
