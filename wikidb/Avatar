89.6	Avatar	Avatar	In Hinduism, an avatar is a deliberate descent of a deity to earth, or a descent of the Supreme Being (i.e., Vishnu for Vaishnavites) and is mostly translated into English as "incarnation," but more accurately as "appearance" or "manifestation".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Avatars.jpg/250px-Avatars.jpg
