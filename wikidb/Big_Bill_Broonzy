52.0	Big_Bill_Broonzy	Big Bill Broonzy	Big Bill Broonzy (June 26, 1903 – August 15, 1958) was a prolific American blues singer, songwriter and guitarist. His career began in the 1920s when he played country blues to mostly black audiences. Through the ‘30s and ‘40s he successfully navigated a transition in style to a more urban blues sound popular with white audiences. In the 1950s a return to his traditional folk-blues roots made him one of the leading figures of the emerging American folk music revival and an international star. His long and varied career marks him as one of the key figures in the development of blues music in the 20th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/81/Big-Bill-Broonzy.jpg/220px-Big-Bill-Broonzy.jpg
