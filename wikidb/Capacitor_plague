64.7	Capacitor_plague	Capacitor plague	The capacitor plague (also known as bad capacitors or "bad caps") is a problem with a large number of premature failures of aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid or liquid electrolyte of certain brands, especially from some Taiwanese manufacturers. The first flawed capacitors were seen in 1999, but most of the affected capacitors failed in the early to mid 2000s. High failure rates occurred in various electronics equipment, particularly motherboards, video cards, compact fluorescent lamp ballasts, LCD monitors, and power supplies of personal computers. News of the failures (usually after a few years of use) forced many equipment manufacturers to repair the defects. The problem seems to be ongoing; faults were still being reported as of 2010.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Al-Elko-bad-caps-Wiki-07-02-17.jpg/220px-Al-Elko-bad-caps-Wiki-07-02-17.jpg
