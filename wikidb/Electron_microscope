79.9	Electron_microscope	Electron microscope	An electron microscope is a type of microscope that uses a beam of electrons to illuminate the specimen and produce a magnified image. Electron microscopes (EM) have a greater resolving power than a light-powered optical microscope, because electrons have wavelengths about 100,000 times shorter than visible light , and can achieve better than 50 pm resolution and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x, whereas ordinary, non-confocal light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200 nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Electron_Microscope.png/220px-Electron_Microscope.png
