1.00	Luminescence_dating	Thermoluminescence dating	Thermoluminescence (TL) dating is the determination, by means of measuring the accumulated radiation dose, of the time elapsed since material containing crystalline minerals was either heated or exposed to sunlight (sediments). As the material is heated, during measurements, thermoluminescence, a weak light signal, is emitted, proportional to the radiation dose absorbed by the material.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Keizars_TLexplained2.jpg/220px-Keizars_TLexplained2.jpg
