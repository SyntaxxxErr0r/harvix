120.8	Utilitarianism	Utilitarianism	Utilitarianism is an ethical theory holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes the overall "happiness". It is thus a form of consequentialism, meaning that the moral worth of an action is determined only by its resulting outcome, and that one can only weigh the morality of an action after knowing all its consequences. Two influential contributors to this theory are Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Peter_Singer_MIT_Veritas.jpg/220px-Peter_Singer_MIT_Veritas.jpg
