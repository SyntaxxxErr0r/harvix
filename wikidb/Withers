39.46	Withers	Withers	The withers is the ridge between the shoulder blades of a four-legged animal. In many species it is the tallest point of the body, and in horses and dogs it is the standard place to measure the animal's height (in contrast, cattle are normally measured to the top of the hips).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Withers.jpg/300px-Withers.jpg
