13.01	Barebones_Parliament	Barebone's Parliament	Barebone's Parliament, also known as the Little Parliament, the Nominated Assembly and the Parliament of Saints, came into being on 4 July 1653, and was the last attempt of the English Commonwealth to find a stable political form before the installation of Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector. It was an assembly entirely nominated by Oliver Cromwell and the Army's Council of Officers. It acquired its name from the nominee for the City of London, Praise-God Barebone. The Speaker of the House was Francis Rous. The total number of nominees was 140, 129 from England, five from Scotland and six from Ireland (see the list of MPs).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Protectorate_%281653%E2%80%931659%29.svg/150px-Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Protectorate_%281653%E2%80%931659%29.svg.png
