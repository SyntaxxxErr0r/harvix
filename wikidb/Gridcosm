4.01	Gridcosm	Gridcosm	Gridcosm is a collaborative art project of the online art collective SITO, in which artists from around the world contribute images to a compounding series of graphical squares. Each level of Gridcosm is made up of nine square images arranged into a 3-by-3 grid. The middle image is a one-third size version of the previous level. Artists add images around that center image until a new 3-by-3 grid is completed, then that level itself shrinks and becomes the "seed" for the next level. This process creates an ever expanding tunnel of images, the newest level a direct result of the previous level which is a result of the previous level... and so on.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Gridcosm-795-796-zoom.png/220px-Gridcosm-795-796-zoom.png
