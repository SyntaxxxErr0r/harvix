2.00	Workers_compensation_claim	Workers' compensation	Workers' compensation is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence. The tradeoff between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as "the compensation bargain."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Pipe_installation_2.jpg/240px-Pipe_installation_2.jpg
