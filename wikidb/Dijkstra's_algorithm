146.4	Dijkstra's_algorithm	Dijkstra's algorithm	Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 and published in 1959, is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with nonnegative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Dijksta_Anim.gif
