2.00	Hispanization	Hispanicization	Hispanicisation or Hispanisation refers to the process by which a place or person becomes influenced by Hispanic culture or a process of cultural and/or linguistic change in which something non-Hispanic becomes Hispanic. Hispanicization is illustrated by, but not limited to, spoken Spanish, production and consumption of Latin food, Spanish language music, and participation in Hispanic festivals and holidays. In linguistic terms, hispanicisation is used as a synonym for Castilianisation (castellanizaci√≥n), the replacement of indigenous languages in the former Spanish colonies and the minority languages in Spain itself by Castilian, usually referred to as the Spanish language.
