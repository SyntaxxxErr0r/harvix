59.1	Teleprompter	Teleprompter	An autocue (also known as an teleprompter or telescript) is a display device that prompts the person speaking with an electronic visual text of a speech or script. Using a teleprompter is similar to the practice of using cue cards. The screen is in front of and usually below the camera lens of a professional video camera, and the words on the screen are reflected to the eyes of the presenter using a sheet of clear glass or specially prepared beam splitter. Light from the performer passes through the front side of the glass into the lens, while a shroud surrounding the lens and the back side of the glass prevents unwanted light from reflecting into the lens.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Teleprompter_schematic.svg/360px-Teleprompter_schematic.svg.png
