56.6	Charles_Coughlin	Charles Coughlin	Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891â€“1979) was a controversial Roman Catholic priest at Royal Oak, Michigan's National Shrine of the Little Flower church. He was one of the first political leaders to use radio to reach a mass audience, as more than thirty million tuned to his weekly broadcasts during the 1930s. Early in his career Coughlin was a vocal supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his early New Deal proposals, before later becoming a harsh critic of Roosevelt as too friendly to bankers. In 1934 he announced a new political organization called the National Union for Social Justice. He wrote a platform calling for monetary reforms, the nationalization of major industries and railroads, and protection of the rights of labor. The membership ran into the millions, resembling the Populist movement of the 1890s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/CharlesCouglinCraineDetroitPortrait.jpg/220px-CharlesCouglinCraineDetroitPortrait.jpg
