137.2	Ester	Ester	Esters are chemical compounds derived by reacting an oxoacid with a hydroxyl compound such as an alcohol or phenol. Esters are usually derived from an inorganic acid or organic acid in which at least one -OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an -O-alkyl group, and most commonly from carboxylic acids and alcohols. That is, esters are formed by condensing an acid with an alcohol.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Ester-general.svg/130px-Ester-general.svg.png
