4.30	Demultiplexer	Multiplexer	In electronics, a multiplexer (or MUX) is a device that selects one of several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line. A multiplexer of 2n inputs has n select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output. Multiplexers are mainly used to increase the amount of data that can be sent over the network within a certain amount of time and bandwidth. A multiplexer is also called a data selector.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Multiplexer2.png/300px-Multiplexer2.png
