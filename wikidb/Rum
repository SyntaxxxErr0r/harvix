96.0	Rum	Rum	Rum is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane by-products such as molasses, or directly from sugarcane juice, by a process of fermentation and distillation. The distillate, a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak barrels. Rum can be referred to by descriptors such as "ron viejo" ("old rum") and "ron a√±ejo" ("aged rum").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Rum_display_in_liquor_store.jpg/350px-Rum_display_in_liquor_store.jpg
