15.81	Ueno_Station	Ueno Station	Ueno Station Ueno-eki) is a major railway station in Tokyo's Tait≈ç ward. It is the station used to reach the Ueno district and Ueno Park -- which contains Tokyo National Museum, The National Museum of Western Art, Ueno Zoo, Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and other famous cultural facilities. A major commuter hub, it is also the traditional terminus for long-distance trains from the northern Japan, although with the extension of the Shinkansen lines to Tokyo Station this role has diminished in recent years. A similar extension of conventional lines will extend the Takasaki Line, Utsunomiya Line and Joban Line to Tokyo Station via the Tohoku Through Line on existing little-used tracks and a new viaduct.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Ueno_Station_Main_Building.jpg/250px-Ueno_Station_Main_Building.jpg
