7.10	Nijinsky	Vaslav Nijinsky	Vaslav (or Vatslav) Nijinsky (Russian: ; Russian pronunciation: ; Polish: ; Ukrainian: ; March 12, 1889/1890 â€“ April 8, 1950) was a Russian danseur and choreographer of Polish descent, cited as the greatest male dancer of the early 20th century. He grew to be celebrated for his virtuosity and for the depth and intensity of his characterizations. He could perform en pointe, a rare skill among male dancers at the time (Albright, 2004) and his ability to perform seemingly gravity-defying leaps was also legendary. The choreographer Bronislava Nijinska was his sister. He also had a brother Stassik Nijinsky.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Talisman_-Vayou_-Vaslav_Nijinsky_-1909.JPG/220px-Talisman_-Vayou_-Vaslav_Nijinsky_-1909.JPG
