It is a joint venture between CBS Corporation, the former owners of United Paramount Network (UPN), and Time Warner's Warner Bros., former majority owner of The WB Television Network. The "CW" name is derived from the first letter of the names of these corporations (CBS and Warner Bros.). The network features a lineup of shows that, according to its former President of Entertainment Dawn Ostroff, "appeal to people 18 to 34-years-old". The network currently airs programming six days a week: Monday through Friday afternoons and evenings (in prime time), and Saturday morning children's programming (under their The CW4Kids block).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/The_CW.svg/200px-The_CW.svg.png
