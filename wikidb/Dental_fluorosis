54.3	Dental_fluorosis	Dental fluorosis	Dental fluorosis is a developmental disturbance of dental enamel caused by excessive exposure to high concentrations of fluoride during tooth development. The risk of fluoride overexposure occurs between the ages of 3 months and 8 years. In its mild forms (which are its most common), fluorosis often appears as unnoticeable, tiny white streaks or specks in the enamel of the tooth. In its most severe form, tooth appearance is marred by discoloration or brown markings. The enamel may be pitted, rough and hard to clean. The spots and stains left by fluorosis are permanent and may darken over time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/MildFluorosis02-24-09.jpg/230px-MildFluorosis02-24-09.jpg
