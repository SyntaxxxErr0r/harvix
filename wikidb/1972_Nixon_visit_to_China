It marked the first time a U.S. president had visited the PRC, which at that time considered the U.S. one of its staunchest foes, and the voyage ended 25 years of separation between the two sides.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Nixon_Mao_1972-02-29.png/300px-Nixon_Mao_1972-02-29.png
