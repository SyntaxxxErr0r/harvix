506.9	LaTeX	LaTeX	LaTeX ( , , , or ) is a document markup language and document preparation system for the TeX typesetting program. Within the typesetting system, its name is styled as TX. The term LaTeX refers only to the language in which documents are written, not to the editor used to write those documents. In order to create a document in LaTeX, a .tex file must be created using some form of text editor. While most text editors can be used to create a LaTeX document, a number of editors have been created specifically for working with LaTeX.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/LaTeX_logo.svg/100px-LaTeX_logo.svg.png
