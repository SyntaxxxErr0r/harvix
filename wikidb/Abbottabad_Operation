3.00	Abbottabad_Operation	Death of Osama bin Laden	Osama bin Laden, the former head of the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, was killed in Pakistan on Monday, May 2, 2011, shortly after 1 am local time by DEVGRU/SEAL Team 6, a United States special operations military unit. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by United States President Barack Obama and carried out in a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation by a team of United States Navy SEALs from the SOF (Special Operations Forces). Participating units included United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or, colloquially, by its former name, SEAL Team Six) and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) of the Joint Special Operations Command, with support from CIA operatives on the ground. The raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. After the raid, U.S. forces took bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried it at sea within 24 hours of his death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Osama_bin_Laden_making_a_video_at_his_compound_in_Pakistan-2.jpg/260px-Osama_bin_Laden_making_a_video_at_his_compound_in_Pakistan-2.jpg
