Although they attained a foothold in the redoubt, the men of the 109th Brigade were ultimately forced to retire. The redoubt then remained in German hands until late September, all the while helping to prevent the British capture of the fortress-village of Thiepval.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Attack_on_Schwaben_Redoubt_1_July_1916_map.jpg/300px-Attack_on_Schwaben_Redoubt_1_July_1916_map.jpg
