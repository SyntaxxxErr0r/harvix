54.9	Pro-life	Opposition to the legalization of abortion	Opposition to the legalization of abortion is centered around the pro-life movement (also known as anti-abortion movement) a social and political movement opposing elective abortion on moral grounds and supporting its legal prohibition or restriction. Advocates generally maintain that the human fetus (and in most cases the human embryo) is a person and therefore has a right to life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/M4l2004.jpg/300px-M4l2004.jpg
