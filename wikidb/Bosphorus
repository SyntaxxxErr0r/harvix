112.4	Bosphorus	Bosphorus	The Bosphorus or Bosporus (, Turkish: , Greek: , Vosporos, Bulgarian: , Bosfora), also known as the Istanbul Strait (Turkish: ), is a strait that forms part of the boundary between Europe and Asia. It - along with the Dardanelles - is one of two straits in Turkey. The world's narrowest strait used for international navigation, it connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara (which is connected by the Dardanelles to the Aegean Sea, and thereby to the Mediterranean Sea.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Istambul_and_Bosporus_big.jpg/249px-Istambul_and_Bosporus_big.jpg
