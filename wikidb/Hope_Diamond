62.3	Hope_Diamond	Hope Diamond	The Hope Diamond, also known as "Le bleu de France" or "Le Bijou du Roi", is a large, 45.52-carat (9.10 g), deep-blue diamond, now housed in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington, D.C. It is blue to the naked eye because of trace amounts of boron within its crystal structure, but exhibits red phosphorescence after exposure to ultraviolet light. It is classified as a Type IIb diamond, and is notorious for supposedly being cursed. It has a long recorded history with few gaps in which it changed hands numerous times on its way from India to France to Britain and to the United States. It has been described as the "most famous diamond in the world" and is said to be the second most-visited artwork in the world, after the Mona Lisa.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Hope_Diamond.jpg/200px-Hope_Diamond.jpg
