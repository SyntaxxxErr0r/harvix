20.31	Mount_Sutro	Mount Sutro	Mount Sutro is a hill in San Francisco, California. Most of Mount Sutro remains private property owned by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), but a 61 acres (25 ha) parcel, including the summit, has been set aside as the Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve and is open to the public. It is one of San Francisco's 47 hills, and one of its original "Seven Hills". Sutro Tower, a large television and radio broadcasting tower for the San Francisco Bay Area, does not stand on Mount Sutro, but on a lower hill between it and Twin Peaks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Mount_Sutro_Summit.JPG/200px-Mount_Sutro_Summit.JPG
