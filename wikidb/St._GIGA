1.00	St._GIGA	St.GIGA	St.GIGA Sento.GIGA) is the name of a defunct satellite radio company that was formed as a subsidiary of satellite television company WOWOW and later became semi-independent, forming a keiretsu with its parent. Using the BS network to broadcast digital radio via direct broadcast satellite as a test on November 30, 1990, St.GIGA became the world's first Satellite Digital Audio Broadcast Corporation. Regular broadcasting began March 30, 1991, and by September 1, St.GIGA adopted the commercial-free concept proposed by producer Hiroshi Yokoi and began to charge a broadcasting subscription fee. Following a period of financial difficulties and as part of an agreement with Nintendo, from between April 1995 and June 2000, St.GIGA broadcast digitally encoded video games to owners of Super Famicoms with the Satellaview attachment. Satellaview broadcasts were limited in distribution to Japan alone, however through St.GIGA's services Nintendo broadcast a large number of rare ura- and gaiden-versions of some of their most popular franchises (e.g. The Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Kirby, etc). With the exception of BS Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki, these games have never been re-released and can only be played today via incomplete emulation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/StGigaBSXBios.png
