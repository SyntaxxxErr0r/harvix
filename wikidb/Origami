126.0	Origami	Origami	Origami , from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper"; kami changes to gami due to rendaku) is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding, which started in the 17th century AD at the latest and was popularized outside of Japan in the mid-1900s. It has since then evolved into a modern art form. The goal of this art is to transform a flat sheet of material into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques, and as such the use of cuts or glue are not considered to be origami. Paper cutting and gluing is usually considered kirigami.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/%E6%8A%98%E9%B6%B4_WUXGA.jpg/250px-%E6%8A%98%E9%B6%B4_WUXGA.jpg
