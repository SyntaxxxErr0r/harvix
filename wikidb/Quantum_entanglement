178.8	Quantum_entanglement	Quantum entanglement	Quantum entanglement occurs when particles such as photons, electrons, molecules as large as "buckyballs", and even small diamonds interact physically and then become separated; the type of interaction is such that each resulting member of a pair is properly described by the same quantum mechanical description , which is indefinite in terms of important factors such as position, momentum, spin, polarization, etc.
