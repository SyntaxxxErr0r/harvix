3.00	Ring_fort	Ringfort	Ringforts are circular fortified settlements that were mostly built during the Iron Age (800 BCEâ€“400 CE), although some were built as late as the Early Middle Ages (up until ~1000 CE). They are found in Northern Europe, especially in Ireland. Ringforts come in many sizes and may be built of stone or earth. Earthen ringforts would have been reinforced by at least one stakewall.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Cahergal.jpg/300px-Cahergal.jpg
