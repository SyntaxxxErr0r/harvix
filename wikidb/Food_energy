70.4	Food_energy	Food energy	Many governments require food manufacturers to label the energy content of their products, to help consumers control their energy intake. In the European Union, manufacturers of prepackaged food must label the nutritional energy of their products in both kilocalories and kilojoules, when required. In the United States, the equivalent mandatory labels display only "Calories", often as a substitute for the name of the quantity being measured, food energy; an additional kilojoules figure is optional and is rarely used. The energy content of food is usually given on labels for 100 g, for a typical serving size (according to the manufacturer), and/or for the entire pack contents. A paper published in 2011 by the American Journal of Public Health proposed to also display the time needed to burn the food energy contained in the product by running. This would indicate how much exercise would be necessary if the food would bring the person's energy intake above what is necessary for that day.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Nutrition-label.jpg/220px-Nutrition-label.jpg
