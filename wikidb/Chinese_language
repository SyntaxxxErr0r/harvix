210.4	Chinese_language	Chinese language	The Chinese language (/ Hànyǔ; / Huáyǔ; Zhōngwén) is a language or language family consisting of varieties which are mutually intelligible to varying degrees. Originally the indigenous languages spoken by the Han Chinese in China, it forms one of the branches of Sino-Tibetan family of languages. About one-fifth of the world's population, or over one billion people, speaks some variety of Chinese as their native language. Internal divisions of Chinese are usually perceived by their native speakers as dialects of a single Chinese language, rather than separate languages, although this identification is considered inappropriate by some linguists and Sinologists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Hanyu.png/200px-Hanyu.png
