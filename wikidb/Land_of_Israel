63.4	Land_of_Israel	Land of Israel	The Land of Israel is a Biblical name for the territory roughly corresponding to the area encompassed by the Southern Levant, also known as Palestine, Canaan, Promised Land and the Holy Land. The belief that the area is a God-given homeland of the Jewish people is based on the narrative of the Torah, especially the books of Genesis and Exodus, as well as the Prophets. According to the Book of Genesis, the land was promised by God to the descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac and to the Israelites, descendants of Jacob, Abraham's grandson. A literal reading of the text suggests that the land promise is (or was at one time) one of the Biblical covenants between God and the Israelites.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/1695_Eretz_Israel_map_in_Amsterdam_Haggada_by_Abraham_Bar-Jacob.jpg/200px-1695_Eretz_Israel_map_in_Amsterdam_Haggada_by_Abraham_Bar-Jacob.jpg
