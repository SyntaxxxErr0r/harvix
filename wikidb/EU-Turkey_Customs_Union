2.10	EU-Turkey_Customs_Union	European Unionâ€“Turkey Customs Union	On 31 December 1995 the customs union between Turkey and the European Union came into effect. Goods can travel between the two entities without any customs restrictions. The Customs Union does not cover essential economic areas, such as agriculture, to which bilateral trade concessions apply, services or public procurement. The EU-Turkey Customs Union is one of the steps towards full Turkish membership of the European Union itself.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Flag_of_Turkey.svg/220px-Flag_of_Turkey.svg.png
