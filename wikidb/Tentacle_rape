51.3	Tentacle_rape	Tentacle erotica	Tentacle erotica describes a type of pornography most commonly found in Japan. It integrates elements of traditional pornography with horror or science-fiction themes. Tentacle erotica can be of a consensual nature, but frequently has elements of non-consensual sex. Tentacle rape or shokushu goukan ) is found in some horror or hentai titles, with tentacled creatures (usually fictional monsters) having sexual intercourse with female characters. The genre is popular enough in Japan that it is occasionally even the subject of parody. In recent years, Japanese and Asian films of this genre have become more common in the United States and Europe. This, along with the presence of many websites featuring it, has expanded the genre's audience globally, although it still remains a small, fetish-oriented part of the adult film industry. While most tentacle erotica is animated, there are also a smaller number of live-action movies featuring this theme.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Tako_to_ama_retouched.jpg/300px-Tako_to_ama_retouched.jpg
