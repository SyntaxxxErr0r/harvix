The epicenter was 130 kilometers (81 mi) off the east coast of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku near Sendai, with the hypocenter at a depth of 32 km (19.9 mi). The earthquake triggered extremely destructive tsunami waves of up to 10 meters (33 ft) that struck Japan minutes after the quake, in some cases traveling up to 10 km (6 mi) inland, with smaller waves reaching many other countries after several hours. Tsunami warnings were issued and evacuations ordered along Japan's Pacific coast and at least 20 other countries, including the entire Pacific coast of North America and South America.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Japan_location_map_with_side_map_of_the_Ryukyu_Islands.svg/250px-Japan_location_map_with_side_map_of_the_Ryukyu_Islands.svg.png
