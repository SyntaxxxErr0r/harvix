258.7	Nelson_Mandela	Nelson Mandela	Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (Xhosa pronunciation: ; born 18 July 1918) served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999, and was the first South African president to be elected in a fully representative democratic election. Before his presidency, Mandela was a militant anti-apartheid activist, and the leader and co-founder of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC). In 1962 he was arrested and convicted of sabotage and other charges, and sentenced to life in prison. Mandela served 27 years in prison, spending many of these years on Robben Island. Following his release from prison on 11 February 1990, Mandela led his party in the negotiations that led to democracy in 1994. As president, he frequently gave priority to reconciliation, while introducing policies aimed at combating poverty and inequality in South Africa.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Nelson_Mandela-2008_%28edit%29.jpg/245px-Nelson_Mandela-2008_%28edit%29.jpg
