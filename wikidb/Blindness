94.1	Blindness	Blindness	Blindness is the condition of lacking visual perception due to physiological or neurological factors. Various scales have been developed to describe the extent of vision loss and define blindness. Total blindness is the complete lack of form and visual light perception and is clinically recorded as NLP, an abbreviation for "no light perception." Blindness is frequently used to describe severe visual impairment with residual vision. Those described as having only light perception have no more sight than the ability to tell light from dark and the general direction of a light source.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Long_cane.jpg/100px-Long_cane.jpg
