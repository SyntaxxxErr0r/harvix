The identities of 17 of those archers are known, though a number of those are known only by their surnames. It was the first time that archery was featured in the Olympics. All six events were for men. Only France, Belgium, and the Netherlands sent archers. None of the Dutch archers are known by name and none won any medals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Archery_pictogram.svg/100px-Archery_pictogram.svg.png
