321.0	Cat	Cat	The domestic cat is a small, usually furry, domesticated, carnivorous mammal. It is often called the housecat, or simply the cat when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are valued by humans for companionship and ability to hunt vermin and household pests.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Cat_poster_2.jpg/250px-Cat_poster_2.jpg
