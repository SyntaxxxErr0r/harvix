61.0	Riemann_zeta_function	Riemann zeta function	The Riemann zeta function or Euler-Riemann zeta function, ζ(s), is a function of a complex variable s that analytically continues the sum of the infinite series which converges when the real part of s is greater than 1. More general representations of ζ(s) for all s are given below. The Riemann zeta function plays a pivotal role in analytic number theory and has applications in physics, probability theory, and applied statistics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Complex_zeta.jpg/300px-Complex_zeta.jpg
