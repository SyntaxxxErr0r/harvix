1.10	5BBB	5BBB	5BBB, branded as Triple B FM, is a community radio station in the Barossa Valley, South Australia. Its studios are located in the former Tanunda Railway Station, and its transmitter on Kaiser Stuhl broadcasts the station to the Barossa Valley and surrounds, with its signal audible as far south as Adelaide. It broadcasts on a frequency of 89.1 MHz, although it launched on 91.9 and then moved to 101.5: both moves were to prevent interference with nearby broadcasters (ABRS and 5UV respectively).
