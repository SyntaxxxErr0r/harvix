56.4	Q_document	Q source	The Q source (also Q document or Q) is a hypothetical written source for the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke. Q (short for the German Quelle, or "source") is defined as the "common" material found in Matthew and Luke but not in the Gospel of Mark. This ancient text supposedly contained the logia or quotations from Jesus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Synoptic_problem_two_source_colored.png/200px-Synoptic_problem_two_source_colored.png
