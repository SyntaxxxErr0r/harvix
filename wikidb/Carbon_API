4.00	Carbon_API	Carbon (API)	Carbon is one of Apple Inc.'s procedural application programming interfaces (APIs) for the Macintosh operating system. It provides C programming language access to Macintosh system services. Carbon provides a good degree of backward compatibility for programs to run on the now-obsolete Mac OS 8 and 9, however these systems are no longer actively supported since Apple released the final OS 9 update in December 2001.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d4/Adobe_ImageReady_7.0_running_on_Mac_OS_X.png/275px-Adobe_ImageReady_7.0_running_on_Mac_OS_X.png
