99.3	California_electricity_crisis	California electricity crisis	The California electricity crisis, also known as the Western U.S. Energy Crisis of 2000 and 2001 was a situation in which California had a shortage of electricity caused by market manipulations and illegal shutdowns of pipelines by Texas energy consortiums. The state suffered from multiple large-scale blackouts, one of the state's largest energy companies collapsed, and the economic fall-out greatly harmed Governor Gray Davis's standing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/PG%26E_Yard.jpg/200px-PG%26E_Yard.jpg
