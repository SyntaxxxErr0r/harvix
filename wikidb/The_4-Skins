13.12	The_4-Skins	The 4-Skins	The 4-Skins are a working class Oi! punk rock band from the East End of London, England. Originally composed of Gary Hodges (vocals), 'Hoxton' Tom McCourt (guitar), Steve 'H' Hamer (bass) and Gary Hitchcock (drums), they formed in 1979 and disbanded in 1984 â€“ although new line-ups formed in 2007 and 2008. Many of their songs dealt with violent topics, but the band has claimed they were discussing the realities of inner city life, not promoting violence. Other 4-Skins song topics include police harassment, political corruption, war and unemployment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/The_4-Skins_1980.jpg/220px-The_4-Skins_1980.jpg
