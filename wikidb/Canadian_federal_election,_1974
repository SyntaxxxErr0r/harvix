7.30	Canadian_federal_election,_1974	Canadian federal election, 1974	The Canadian federal election of 1974 was held on July 8, 1974 to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 30th Parliament of Canada. The governing Liberal Party was reelected, going from a minority to a majority government, and gave Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau his third term. The Progressive Conservatives, led by Robert Stanfield, did well in the Atlantic provinces, and in the West, but the Liberal support in Ontario and Quebec ensured a majority Liberal government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/HFX_Airport_8.jpg/129px-HFX_Airport_8.jpg
