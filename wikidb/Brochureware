58.6	Brochureware	Brochureware	A brochureware website is a business website that has very infrequently updated content. Often the site has been developed as a direct translation of existing printed promotional materials, hence the name. Brochureware sites therefore take little advantage of the capabilities of the web that are unavailable in printed publication.
