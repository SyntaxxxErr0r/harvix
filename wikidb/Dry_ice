59.3	Dry_ice	Dry ice	Dry ice, sometimes referred to as "Cardice" or as "card ice" (chiefly British English), is the solid form of carbon dioxide. It is used primarily as a cooling agent. Its advantages include lower temperature than that of water ice and not leaving any residue (other than incidental frost from moisture in the atmosphere). It is useful for preserving frozen foods, ice cream, etc., where mechanical cooling is unavailable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Dry_Ice_Pellets_Subliming.jpg/220px-Dry_Ice_Pellets_Subliming.jpg
