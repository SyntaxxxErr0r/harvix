1.00	Esophageal_Cancer	Esophageal cancer	Esophageal cancer (or oesophageal cancer) is malignancy of the esophagus. There are various subtypes, primarily squamous cell cancer (approx 90-95% of all esophageal cancer worldwide) and adenocarcinoma (approx. 50-80% of all esophageal cancer in the United States). Squamous cell cancer arises from the cells that line the upper part of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells that are present at the junction of the esophagus and stomach.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Esophageal_adenoca.jpg/230px-Esophageal_adenoca.jpg
