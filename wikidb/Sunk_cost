71.3	Sunk_cost	Sunk costs	In economics and business decision-making, sunk costs are retrospective (past) costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken. Both retrospective and prospective costs may be either fixed (that is, they are not dependent on the volume of economic activity, however measured) or variable (dependent on volume).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Daniel_KAHNEMAN.jpg
