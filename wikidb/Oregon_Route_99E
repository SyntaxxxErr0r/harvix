1.00	Oregon_Route_99E	Oregon Route 99E	Oregon Route 99E is an Oregon state highway that runs between Junction City, Oregon and an interchange with I-5 just south of the Oregon/Washington border, in Portland. It, along with OR 99W, make up a split of OR 99 in the northern part of the state. This split existed when the route was US 99, the two branches were then U.S. 99W and U.S. Route 99E. (Other such splits occurred in California, but with the decommissioning of US 99, that state elected to rename one of the branches as something else, rather than preserve the directional suffix).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Oregon_Route_99E.svg/290px-Oregon_Route_99E.svg.png
