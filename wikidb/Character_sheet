20.11	Character_sheet	Character sheet	A character sheet is a record of a player character in a role-playing game, including whatever details, notes, game statistics, and background information a player would need during a play session. Character sheets can be found in use in both traditional and action role-playing games. Almost all roleplaying games make use of character sheets in some fashion; even "rules-light" systems and freeform role-playing games record character details in some manner.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Stormbringer_Charakterbogen.png/200px-Stormbringer_Charakterbogen.png
