3.00	General_Strike	General strike	A general strike is a strike action by a critical mass of the labour force in a city, region, or country. While a general strike can be for political goals, economic goals, or both, it tends to gain its momentum from the ideological or class sympathies of the participants. It is also characterized by participation of workers in a multitude of workplaces, and tends to involve entire communities. The general strike has waxed and waned in popularity since the mid-19th century, and has characterized many historically important strikes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Vorw%C3%A4rts.jpg/220px-Vorw%C3%A4rts.jpg
