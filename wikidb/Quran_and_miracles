1.00	Quran_and_miracles	Quran and miracles	Muslims consider the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, as the word of God and a miracle. According to Islamic Faith, the Qur'an was revealed miraculously to Muhammad from Allah (God) through angel JibrÄ«l (Gabriel), as a perfect, verbatim copy of what was written in heaven and existed there from all eternity. Therefore the verses of the book are referred to as ayat, which also means "a sign" in the Arabic language. Some muslims therefore believe that the Qur'an is the same as was revealed to Muhammad in the year 610. In the Qur'an is stated an open challenge for anyone who denies its claimed divine origin to produce a text like it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Quran_cover.jpg/120px-Quran_cover.jpg
