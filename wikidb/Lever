63.7	Lever	Lever	A lever ( or ) is constructed from a beam attached to ground by a hinge, or fulcrum. It is one of the six simple machines identified by Renaissance scientists. The word comes from the French lever, "to raise", cf. a levant. A lever amplifies an input force to provide a greater output force, which is said to provide leverage. The ratio of the output force to the input force is the ideal mechanical advantage of the lever.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Palanca-ejemplo.jpg/220px-Palanca-ejemplo.jpg
