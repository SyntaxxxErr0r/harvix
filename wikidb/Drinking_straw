14.23	Drinking_straw	Drinking straw	A drinking straw is a short tube intended for transferring a beverage from its container to the mouth of the drinker by use of suction. A thin tube of plastic (such as polypropylene and polystyrene) or other material, straight or with an accordion-like living hinge, it is employed by being held with one end in the mouth and another end in the drink. Muscular action reduces air pressure in the mouth, whereupon atmospheric pressure forces the drink up the straw.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Drink_with_straw.jpg/220px-Drink_with_straw.jpg
