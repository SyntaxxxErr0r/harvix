54.6	Cork_taint	Cork taint	Cork taint is a broad term referring to a wine fault characterized by a set of undesirable smells or tastes found in a bottle of wine, especially spoilage that can only be detected after bottling, aging and opening. Though modern studies have shown that other factors can also be responsible for taint – including wooden barrels, storage conditions and the transport of corks and wine – the cork stopper is normally considered to be responsible, and a wine found to be tainted on opening is said to be "corked" or "corky". Cork taint can affect wines irrespective of price and quality level.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/2%2C4%2C6-Trichloroanisole.svg/220px-2%2C4%2C6-Trichloroanisole.svg.png
