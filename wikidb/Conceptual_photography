15.22	Conceptual_photography	Conceptual photography	Conceptual photography as a part of conceptual art is a photography genre in which the artist makes a photograph of a concept or idea. Usually the conception of the idea precedes the realization of the photography. This kind of photography often involves use of computer editing to achieve the desired effects, but many artists work without the computer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Atget_-_Avenue_des_Gobelins.jpg/220px-Atget_-_Avenue_des_Gobelins.jpg
