1.20	Cerro_San_Luis_Obispo	Cerro San Luis Obispo	Cerro San Luis Obispo is a 1,292 feet (394 m) mountain in San Luis Obispo, California. It is part of the chain of peaks called the Nine Sisters, and is often referred to as San Luis Mountain, Mount San Luis, or Madonna Mountain. It is a popular spot for mountain biking and hiking, offering spectacular views and steep terrain. There is a wide dirt road traversing the mountain that leads to the peak. Right below the west side of the visible peak, there is a fairly large plateau with a large wooden stage on the east end. A large white "M" is present on the east face, which derives from the Mission School and not Madonna as most believe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/97/SanLuisObispoCalifCityView600.jpg/280px-SanLuisObispoCalifCityView600.jpg
