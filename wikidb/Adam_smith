92.5	Adam_smith	Adam Smith	Adam Smith (baptised 16 June 1723 â€“ 17 July 1790 ) was a Scottish social philosopher and a pioneer of political economy. One of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, Smith is the author of The Principles Which Lead and Direct Philosophical Enquiries, Illustrated by the History of Astronomy, prior to 1758, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 1759, and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776. The latter, usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. It earned him an enormous reputation and would become one of the most influential works ever published. Smith is widely cited as the father of modern economics and capitalism. In 2009, Smith was named among the 'Greatest Scots' of all time, in a vote run by Scottish television channel STV.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/AdamSmith.jpg/200px-AdamSmith.jpg
