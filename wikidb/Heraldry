78.1	Heraldry	Heraldry	Heraldry is the profession, study, or art of creating, granting, and blazoning arms and ruling on questions of rank or protocol, as exercised by an officer of arms. Heraldry comes from Anglo-Norman herald, from the Germanic compound harja-waldaz, "army commander". The word, in its most general sense, encompasses all matters relating to the duties and responsibilities of officers of arms. To most, though, heraldry is the practice of designing, displaying, describing, and recording coats of arms and heraldic badges.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Hyghalmen_Roll_Late_1400s.jpg/250px-Hyghalmen_Roll_Late_1400s.jpg
