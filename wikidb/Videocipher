4.02	Videocipher	Videocipher	VideoCipher is a brand name of analog scrambling and de-scrambling equipment for cable and satellite television invented primarily to keep consumer Television receive-only (TVRO) satellite equipment from receiving TV programing except on a subscription basis. It was invented in 1983 by Linkabit Corporation, which was bought out by M/A-COM in 1985. M/A-COM was finally bought out by General Instrument in 1987. Currently, Videocipher technology is controlled by Motorola Corporation. Videocipher scrambling usually involves the DES encryption scheme. With the shift to digital satellite and digital cable transmission, Videocipher began to fade from existence, and was officially fully retired on December 31, 2008. As of March 30, 2010 there are at least three channels still using Videocipher II(+), though they cannot be subscribed to by the general public.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Video_cipher.JPG/250px-Video_cipher.JPG
