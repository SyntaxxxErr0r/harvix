3.00	Biscuitville	Biscuitville	Biscuitville is a privately held regional fast-food restaurant chain consisting of 58 locations in the U.S. states of North Carolina and Virginia. The restaurants specialize in breakfast food and Southern cuisine. All biscuits served at Biscuitville restaurants are made from scratch "hot every 20 minutes". The company, originally named Mountainbrook Fresh Bread &amp; Milk (eventually known as Pizzaville), started as two bread stores in Burlington, North Carolina. The founder, Maurice Jennings, began making pizzas, but soon wanted a way to put the business to work in the morning. The company began making biscuits, and the company eventually sold more biscuits than pizzas. The company decided to open its first biscuit-only operation, which it named "Biscuitville", opened in Danville, VA, in 1975. Today, the corporate headquarters is in Greensboro, North Carolina. The company has put all future expansion plans on hold indefinitely .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/2008-08-10_Biscuitville_in_Durham.jpg/350px-2008-08-10_Biscuitville_in_Durham.jpg
