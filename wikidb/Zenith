53.9	Zenith	Zenith	The zenith is an imaginary point directly "above" a particular location, on the imaginary celestial sphere. "Above" means in the vertical direction opposite to the apparent gravitational force at that location. The opposite direction, i.e. the direction in which the gravitational force pulls, is toward the nadir.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Zenith-Nadir-Horizon.svg/300px-Zenith-Nadir-Horizon.svg.png
