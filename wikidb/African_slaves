7.00	African_slaves	African slave trade	The African slave trade refers to the historic slave trade within Africa. Systems of servitude and slavery were common in many parts of the continent, as they were in much of the ancient world. In some African societies, the enslaved people were also indentured servants and fully integrated; in others, they were treated much worse. When the Arab slave trade and Atlantic slave trade began, many local slave systems changed and began supplying captives for slave markets outside of Africa.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/AfricanSlavesTransport.jpg/300px-AfricanSlavesTransport.jpg
