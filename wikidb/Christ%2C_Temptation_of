According to these texts, after being baptized, Jesus fasted for forty days and nights in the Judean desert. During this time, the devil appeared to Jesus and tempted him. Jesus having refused each temptation, the devil departed and angels came and brought nourishment to Jesus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Temptations_of_Christ_%28San_Marco%29.jpg/300px-Temptations_of_Christ_%28San_Marco%29.jpg
