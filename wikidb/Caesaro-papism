3.00	Caesaro-papism	Caesaropapism	Caesaropapism is the idea of combining the power of secular government with the religious power, or making it superior to, the spiritual authority of the Church; especially concerning the connection of the Church with government. The term caesaropapism was coined by Max Weber, who defined it as follows: “a secular, caesaropapist ruler... exercises supreme authority in ecclesiastic matters by virtue of his autonomous legitimacy”. According to Weber's political sociology, caesaropapism entails “the complete subordination of priests to secular power.”	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/PapalPolitics2.JPG/220px-PapalPolitics2.JPG
