173.5	PCRE	Perl Compatible Regular Expressions	Perl Compatible Regular Expressions is a regular expression C library inspired by Perl's external interface, written by Philip Hazel. PCRE's syntax is much more powerful and flexible than either of the POSIX regular expression flavors and many classic regular expression libraries. The name is misleading, because PCRE is Perl-compatible only if you consider a subset of PCRE's settings and a subset of Perl's regular expression facilities.
