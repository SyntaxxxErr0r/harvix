52.4	Budgerigar	Budgerigar	The budgerigar ( ), also known as common pet parakeet or shell parakeet informally nicknamed the budgie, is a small, long-tailed, seed-eating parrot, and the only species in the Australian genus Melopsittacus. Wild budgerigars are found throughout the drier parts of Australia, where the species has survived harsh inland conditions for the last five million years. Naturally green and yellow with black, scalloped markings on the nape, back, and wings, breeders have created a rainbow of blues, whites, and yellows, greys, and even forms with small crests. Budgerigars are popular pets around the world due to their small size, low cost, ability to mimic human speech and playful nature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Wellensittich_maennchen_wildfarben.jpg/300px-Wellensittich_maennchen_wildfarben.jpg
