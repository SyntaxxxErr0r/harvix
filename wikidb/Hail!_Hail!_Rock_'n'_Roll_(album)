1.00	Hail!_Hail!_Rock_'n'_Roll_(album)	Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll (album)	Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll is a Chuck Berry album and soundtrack to the film of the same name, which was released in 1987 under record label, MCA. The album was recorded live at The Fox Theatre, St Louis, Missouri and Berry Park, Wentzville, Missouri on October 6 and October 16, 1986. The event was held to celebrate Chuck Berry's 60th birthday and it included several special guests. It is ironic that the album does not include the Berry song "School Days," which includes the line the album's title is derived from (although the song does appear in the film).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/Chuck_Berry_-_Hail%21_Hail%21_Rock_%27N%27_Roll.jpg
