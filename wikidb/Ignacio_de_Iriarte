1.00	Ignacio_de_Iriarte	Ignacio de Iriarte	Iriarte was born in Azcoitia, Guipuzcoa. He received his early education at home, but in 1642 went to Seville, and entered the studio of Francisco Herrera the Elder. Here he learned to understand colouring, but he was never able to draw the human figure with spirit or accuracy, and therefore determined to devote his attention exclusively to landscape, and was the one Spanish artist who walked that rarely trodden path, and obtained in it the greatest possible celebrity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Iriarte_Landscape_with_Figures.jpg/220px-Iriarte_Landscape_with_Figures.jpg
