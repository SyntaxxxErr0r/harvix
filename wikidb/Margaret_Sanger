102.0	Margaret_Sanger	Margaret Sanger	Margaret Higgins Sanger (September 14, 1879 â€“ September 6, 1966) was an American sex educator, nurse, and birth control activist. Sanger coined the term birth control, opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, and established Planned Parenthood. Sanger's efforts contributed to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case which legalized contraception in the United States. Sanger is a frequent target of criticism by opponents of the legalization of abortion, based primarily upon her racial views and support of eugenics, but she remains an iconic figure for the American reproductive rights movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg/220px-MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg
