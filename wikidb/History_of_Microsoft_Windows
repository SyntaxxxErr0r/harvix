53.6	History_of_Microsoft_Windows	History of Microsoft Windows	The first independent version of Microsoft Windows, version 1.0, released on 20 November 1985, achieved little popularity. It was originally going to be called "Interface Manager" but Rowland Hanson, the head of marketing at Microsoft, convinced the company that the name Windows would be more appealing to consumers. Windows 1.0 was not a complete operating system, but rather an "operating environment" that extended MS-DOS, and shared the latter's inherent flaws and problems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fe/Os2logo.svg/220px-Os2logo.svg.png
