8.02	History_of_Puerto_Rico	History of Puerto Rico	The history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the archipelago of Puerto Rico by the Ortoiroid people between 3000 and 2000 BC. Other tribes, such as the Saladoid and Arawak Indians, populated the island between 430 BC and 1000 AD. At the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Taínos. The Taíno culture died out during the latter half of the 16th century because of exploitation by Spanish settlers, the war they waged on the Taíno, and diseases introduced by the invaders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/1903_map_of_Porto_Rico_%28Puerto_Rico%29_.jpg/400px-1903_map_of_Porto_Rico_%28Puerto_Rico%29_.jpg
