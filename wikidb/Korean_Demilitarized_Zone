108.1	Korean_Demilitarized_Zone	Korean Demilitarized Zone	The Korean Demilitarized Zone (Hangul: ; Hanja: ) is a strip of land running across the Korean Peninsula that serves as a buffer zone between North and South Korea which runs along the 38th parallel north. The DMZ cuts the Korean Peninsula roughly in half, crossing the 38th parallel on an angle, with the west end of the DMZ lying south of the parallel and the east end lying north of it. It is 250 kilometres (160 miles) long, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) wide and is the most heavily militarized border in the world. The Northern Limit Line, or NLL, is the de facto maritime boundary between North and South Korea in the Yellow Sea and the coastline and islands on both sides of the NLL are also heavily militarized.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Korea_DMZ_sentry.jpg/300px-Korea_DMZ_sentry.jpg
