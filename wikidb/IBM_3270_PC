4.00	IBM_3270_PC	IBM 3270 PC	The IBM 3270 PC (model 5271), released in October 1983, was an IBM PC XT containing additional hardware which could emulate the behaviour of an IBM 3270 terminal. It could therefore be used both as a standalone computer, and as a terminal to a mainframe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Ibm_px_xt_color.jpg/275px-Ibm_px_xt_color.jpg
