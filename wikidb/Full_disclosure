59.1	Full_disclosure	Full disclosure	In computer security, full disclosure (FD) is the disclosure of all the details of a security problem which are known. It is a philosophy of security management completely opposed to the idea of security through obscurity. The concept of full disclosure is controversial, but not new; it has been an issue for locksmiths since the 19th century.
