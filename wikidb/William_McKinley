McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals. McKinley's administration ended with his assassination in September 1901, but his presidency began a period of over a third of a century dominated by the Republican Party.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/William_McKinley_by_Courtney_Art_Studio%2C_1896.jpg/220px-William_McKinley_by_Courtney_Art_Studio%2C_1896.jpg
