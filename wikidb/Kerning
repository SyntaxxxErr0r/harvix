185.55	Kerning	Kerning	In typography, kerning (less commonly mortising) is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a visually pleasing result. Kerning is the adjustment of the space between individual letter forms vs. tracking which is the uniform adjustment of spacing applied over a range of characters. In a well-kerned font, the two-dimensional blank spaces between each pair of characters all have similar area. The related term kern denotes a part of a type letter that overhangs the edge of the type block.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Tracking_vs_Kerning.svg/375px-Tracking_vs_Kerning.svg.png
