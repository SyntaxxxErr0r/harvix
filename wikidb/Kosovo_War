85.6	Kosovo_War	Kosovo War	The terms Kosovo War or Kosovo conflict refer to two sequential, and at times parallel, armed conflicts in Kosovo province, then part of FR Yugoslavia. From early 1998 to 1999, there was an armed conflict initiated by the ethnic Albanian "Kosovo Liberation Army" (KLA), who sought independence (classified by Serbia as terrorists), against the Serbian police and Yugoslav Military. From March 24, 1999 to June 11, 1999, NATO launched an air campaign on FR Yugoslavia, while the KLA continued battles with Yugoslav Security Forces, amidst a massive population displacement estimated to be close to 800,000 people.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Kosovo_War_header.jpg/300px-Kosovo_War_header.jpg
