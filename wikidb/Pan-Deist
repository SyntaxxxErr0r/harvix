1.00	Pan-Deist	Pandeism	Pandeism or Pan-Deism (from Greek: "all" and Latin: meaning "God" in the sense of deism), is a term describing beliefs incorporating or mixing logically reconcilable elements of pantheism (that "God", or its metaphysical equivalent, is identical to the Universe) and deism (that the creator-god who designed the Universe no longer exists in a status where it can be reached, and can instead be confirmed only by reason). It is therefore most particularly the belief that the Creator of the Universe actually became the Universe, and so ceased to exist as a separate and conscious entity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Johannes-Scotus-Erigena.jpg/180px-Johannes-Scotus-Erigena.jpg
