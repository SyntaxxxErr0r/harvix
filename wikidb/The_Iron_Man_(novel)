18.72	The_Iron_Man_(novel)	The Iron Man (novel)	The Iron Man: A Children's Story in Five Nights is a 1968 novel written by British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and illustrated by Andrew Davidson. Described by some as a modern fairy tale, it describes the unexpected arrival in England of a giant "metal man" of unknown origin who rains destruction on the countryside by attacking industrial farm equipment, before befriending a small boy and defending the world from an apparent dragon from outer space. Expanding the narrative beyond a criticism of warfare and inter-human conflict, Hughes later wrote a sequel, The Iron Woman, describing retribution based on environmental themes related to pollution. Prior to publishing in North America, the title was changed to The Iron Giant (as were all references to the metal man) to avoid confusion and legal issues with Marvel Comics' character, Iron Man.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/Iron_man_book.jpg/200px-Iron_man_book.jpg
