1.00	ShowMan	ShowMan	ShowMan is show control software developed by Richmond Sound Design. It supersedes the original Amiga show control software named Stage Manager and is capable of reading shows created by that application. Show control is the use of technology to link together and operate multiple entertainment control systems in a coordinated manner. It is distinguished from more specific forms, e.g. lighting control), which coordinates elements within a single entertainment discipline such as lighting, sound, video, rigging or pyrotechnics.
