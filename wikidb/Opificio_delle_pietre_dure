2.00	Opificio_delle_pietre_dure	Opificio delle pietre dure	Being one of the famous artistic workshops of the Italian Renaissance, the Opificio was established in 1588 at the behest of Ferdinando I de' Medici to provide the elaborate, inlaid precious and semi-precious stoneworks. One of the masterpieces of the crafts is the overall decoration of the Cappella dei Principi (Chapel of Princes) in the Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze. The technique, which originated from Byzantine inlay work, was perfected by the Opificio masters and the artworks they produced became known as "opere di Commessi Mediceo" (commesso is the old name of the technique, similar to ancient mosaics) and later as "Commesso in Pietre Dure" (semi-precious stones mosaic).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Cathedral_Virgin_Mary-7.jpg/220px-Cathedral_Virgin_Mary-7.jpg
