2.00	Neoconservatism	Neoconservatism	Neoconservatism is a variant of the political ideology of conservatism which combines features of traditional conservatism with political individualism and a qualified endorsement of free markets. Neoconservatism (or new conservatives) is rooted in a group of former liberals, who in the late 1960s, began to oppose many of the policies and principles associated with President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs. The term "neoconservative" was initially used in the 1930s to describe American liberals who criticized other liberals who followed a path closer to Soviet communism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/HenryJackson.jpg/150px-HenryJackson.jpg
