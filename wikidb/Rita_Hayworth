61.6	Rita_Hayworth	Rita Hayworth	Rita Hayworth (born Margarita Carmen Cansino; October 17, 1918 â€“ May 14, 1987) was an American dancer and film actress who garnered fame during the 1940s as one of the era's top stars. Appearing first as Rita Cansino, she agreed to change her name to Rita Hayworth and her hair color to dark red to attract a greater range in roles. Her appeal led to her being featured on the cover of Life magazine five times, beginning in 1940.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Rita_Hayworth_Blood_and_Sand.jpg/220px-Rita_Hayworth_Blood_and_Sand.jpg
