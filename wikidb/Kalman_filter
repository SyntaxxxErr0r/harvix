56.1	Kalman_filter	Kalman filter	The Kalman filter, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm which uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing noise (random variations) and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more precise than those that would be based on a single measurement alone. More formally, the Kalman filter operates recursively on streams of noisy input data to produce a statistically optimal estimate of the underlying system state. The filter is named for Rudolf (Rudy) E. Kálmán, one of the primary developers of its theory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Basic_concept_of_Kalman_filtering.svg/400px-Basic_concept_of_Kalman_filtering.svg.png
