74.7	Molybdenum	Molybdenum	Molybdenum ( -ib--nəm or -di-nəm), is a Group 6 chemical element with the symbol Mo and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin Molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek , meaning lead, itself proposed as a loanword from Anatolian Luvian and Lydian languages, since its ores were confused with lead ores. The free element, which is a silvery metal, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. It readily forms hard, stable carbides, and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys. Molybdenum does not occur as a free metal on Earth, but rather in various oxidation states in minerals. Industrially, molybdenum compounds are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications, as pigments and catalysts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Molybdenum_crystaline_fragment_and_1cm3_cube.jpg/260px-Molybdenum_crystaline_fragment_and_1cm3_cube.jpg
