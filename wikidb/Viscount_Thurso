It was created in 1952 for the Scottish Liberal politician and former Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, 4th Baronet. His son, the second Viscount, served as Lord Lieutenant of Caithness from 1973 to 1995. As of 2009 the titles are held by the latter's son, the third Viscount, who succeeded in 1995. Known as John Thurso, he is a Liberal Democrat politician. Thurso lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. However, he was elected to the House of Commons in 2001, thereby becoming the first hereditary peer of the United Kingdom allowed to sit in the Commons without first disclaiming his title.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/John_Thurso_MP_at_Bournemouth_2009.jpg/220px-John_Thurso_MP_at_Bournemouth_2009.jpg
