85.6	Nikita_Khrushchev	Nikita Khrushchev	Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushcheva (April 15 1894 â€“ September 11, 1971) led the Soviet Union during part of the Cold War. He served as First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, and as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, or Premier, from 1958 to 1964. Khrushchev was responsible for the partial de-Stalinization of the Soviet Union, for backing the progress of the early Soviet space program, and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy. Khrushchev's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964, replacing him with Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Premier.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-B0628-0015-035%2C_Nikita_S._Chruchstschow.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-B0628-0015-035%2C_Nikita_S._Chruchstschow.jpg
