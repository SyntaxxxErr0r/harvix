4.10	Tajin	El Tajín	El Tajín is a pre-Columbian archeological site and one of the largest and most important cities of the Classic era of Mesoamerica. A part of the Classic Veracruz culture, El Tajín flourished from 600 to 1200 C.E. and during this time numerous temples, palaces, ballcourts, and pyramids were built. From the time the city fell in 1230 to near the end of the 18th century, no European seems to have known of its existence, until a government inspector chanced upon the Pyramid of the Niches in 1785.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/El_Taj%C3%ADn_1.jpg/250px-El_Taj%C3%ADn_1.jpg
