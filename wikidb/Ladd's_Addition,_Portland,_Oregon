It is located in the Hosford-Abernethy neighborhood in the southeast part of the city. Roughly eight blocks (east-west) by ten blocks (north-south) in size (by reference to the external grid), Ladd's is bordered by SE Hawthorne, Division, 12th, and 20th streets. The neighborhood is known in Portland for its diagonal street pattern, which contrasts markedly with the regular grid of the surrounding areas. This unconventional street layout can be disorienting to drivers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Ladd%27s_Addition_Center_Circle.jpg/250px-Ladd%27s_Addition_Center_Circle.jpg
