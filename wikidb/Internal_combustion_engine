290.7	Internal_combustion_engine	Internal combustion engine	The internal combustion engine (or ICE) is quite different from external combustion engines, such as steam or Stirling engines, in which the energy is delivered to a working fluid not consisting of, mixed with, or contaminated by combustion products. Working fluids can be air, hot water, pressurized water or even liquid sodium, heated in some kind of boiler.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Arbeitsweise_Zweitakt.gif/500px-Arbeitsweise_Zweitakt.gif
