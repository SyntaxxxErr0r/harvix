57.6	Stephen_A._Douglas	Stephen A. Douglas	Stephen Arnold Douglas (23 April 1813 â€“ 3 June 1861) was an American politician from Illinois. He was a US Representative, a US Senator, and was the Democratic Party nominee for President in 1860, losing to Republican Abraham Lincoln. Douglas had previously defeated Lincoln in a Senate contest, noted for the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858. He was nicknamed the "Little Giant" because though short in physical stature, he was a forceful and even dominant figure in politics. Douglas was well known as a resourceful party leader, and an adroit, ready, skillful tactician in debate and passage of legislation. He was a leading proponent of democracy, and believed in the principle of Popular Sovereignty: that the majority of citizens should decide contentious issues such as slavery and territorial expansion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Stephen_A_Douglas_-_headshot.jpg/240px-Stephen_A_Douglas_-_headshot.jpg
