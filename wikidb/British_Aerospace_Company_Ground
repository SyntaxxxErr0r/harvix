2.00	British_Aerospace_Company_Ground	British Aerospace Company Ground	British Aerospace Company Ground was a cricket ground in Byfleet, Surrey. The ground was built as a works venue for the nearby Vickers-Armstrongs factor at nearby Brooklands. In 1920 a factory side was established, although the first recorded match on the ground was in 1970, when Surrey played Warwickshire in what was the grounds first List-A match. From 1970 to 1979, the ground played host to 10 List-A matches, the last of which was between Surrey and Warwickshire in the 1979 John Player League.
