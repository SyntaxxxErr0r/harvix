Each morning one drinks a quart of water with 2 teaspoons of salt or a cup of herbal laxative tea. This is followed by six to twelve lemonade drinks during the day. Finally, a cup of herbal laxative tea is taken in the evening. The lemonade is made from purified or spring water, fresh squeezed lemon juice, organic maple syrup and cayenne pepper. Cayenne pepper herbal pills can be substituted for the cayenne pepper in the lemonade. The alleged purpose is to "detoxify" the body and remove excess fat. The regimen is followed for a minimum of ten days.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Master_Cleanse.jpg/220px-Master_Cleanse.jpg
