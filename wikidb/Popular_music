119.1	Popular_music	Popular music	Popular music belongs to any of a number of musical genres "having wide appeal" and is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional music, which are typically disseminated academically or orally to smaller, local audiences. Although popular music sometimes is known as "pop music", the two terms are not interchangeable. Popular music is a generic term for music of all ages that appeals to popular tastes, whereas pop music usually refers to a specific musical genre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Jenny_Lind_in_La_Sonnambula.jpg/220px-Jenny_Lind_in_La_Sonnambula.jpg
