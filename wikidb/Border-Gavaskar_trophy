It has witnessed some of the most competitive Test series played in recent years, with results usually either being a narrow win for one of the sides or a closely fought draw. It is currently played via the International Cricket Council's future tours program, with varying lengths of time between matches. If the series is drawn, then the country holding the trophy retains it. The series is named after Australian cricketer Allan Border and Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar, who both scored over 10,000 test runs in their career and captained their respective teams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Border-Gavaskar_Trophy_n_Airtel_Cup.jpg/220px-Border-Gavaskar_Trophy_n_Airtel_Cup.jpg
