It is a non-essential amino acid with a polar side group. The word "tyrosine" is from the Greek tyri, meaning cheese, as it was first discovered in 1846 by German chemist Justus von Liebig in the protein casein from cheese. It is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain. When ingested Tyrosine will cause an increase in dopamine and an effect similar to cocaine .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/L-Tyrosin_-_L-Tyrosine.svg/200px-L-Tyrosin_-_L-Tyrosine.svg.png
