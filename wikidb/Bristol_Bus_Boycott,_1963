1.20	Bristol_Bus_Boycott,_1963	Bristol Bus Boycott, 1963	The Bristol Bus Boycott of 1963 arose from the refusal of the Bristol Omnibus Company to employ Black or Asian bus crews in Bristol, England. In common with other British cities there was widespread discrimination in housing and employment at that time against "coloureds." Led by youth worker Paul Stephenson and the West Indian Development Council, the boycott of the company's buses by Bristolians lasted for four months until the company backed down and overturned the colour bar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Bristol_Bus_Boycott01.jpg/220px-Bristol_Bus_Boycott01.jpg
