103.6	Paul_of_Tarsus	Paul the Apostle	Paul the Apostle (c. AD 5 â€“ c. AD 67; variously referred to as the "Apostle Paul" or "Saint Paul"), also known as Saul of Tarsus, is perhaps the most influential early Christian missionary. The writings ascribed to him by the church form a considerable portion of the New Testament. The influence on Christian thinking of the epistles ascribed to him has been significant, due in part to his association as a prominent apostle of Christianity during the spreading of the Gospel through early Christian communities across the Roman Empire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Saint_Paul_Ananias_Sight_Restored.jpg/220px-Saint_Paul_Ananias_Sight_Restored.jpg
