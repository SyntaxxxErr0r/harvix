102.9	Charles_de_Gaulle	Charles de Gaulle	A veteran of World War I, in the 1920s and 1930s de Gaulle came to the fore as a proponent of mobile armoured divisions, which he considered would become central in modern warfare. During World War II, he earned the rank of brigadier general (retained throughout his life), leading one of the few successful armoured counter-attacks during the 1940 Battle of France in May in Montcornet, and then briefly served in the French government as France was falling. De Gaulle was the most senior French military officer to reject the June 1940 armistice to Nazi Germany right from the outset.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/De_Gaulle-OWI.jpg/200px-De_Gaulle-OWI.jpg
