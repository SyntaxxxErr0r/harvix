He was a pupil of Socrates, but adopted a very different philosophical outlook, teaching that the goal of life was to seek pleasure by adapting circumstances to oneself and by maintaining proper control over both adversity and prosperity. Among his pupils was his daughter Arete.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Aristippus.jpg/220px-Aristippus.jpg
