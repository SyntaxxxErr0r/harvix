58.6	Pierre-Simon_Laplace	Pierre-Simon Laplace	Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace (23 March 1749 – 5 March 1827) was a French mathematician and astronomer whose work was pivotal to the development of mathematical astronomy and statistics. He summarized and extended the work of his predecessors in his five volume Mécanique Céleste (1799–1825). This work translated the geometric study of classical mechanics to one based on calculus, opening up a broader range of problems. In statistics, the so-called Bayesian interpretation of probability was mainly developed by Laplace.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Pierre-Simon_Laplace.jpg/220px-Pierre-Simon_Laplace.jpg
