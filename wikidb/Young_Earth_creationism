78.8	Young_Earth_creationism	Young Earth creationism	Young Earth creationism is the religious belief that the Universe, Earth, and all life on Earth were created by direct acts of the Abrahamic God during a relatively short period, sometime between 5,700 and 10,000 years ago. Its primary adherents are Christians and Jews who believe that God created the Earth in six 24-hour days, taking what they regard to be a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative as a basis for their beliefs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/The_Creation_of_Adam.jpg/200px-The_Creation_of_Adam.jpg
