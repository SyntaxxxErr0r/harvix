10.30	A_Year_Without_Rain	A Year Without Rain	A Year Without Rain is the second studio album by American band Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene. The album was released on September 17, 2010 via Hollywood Records. The band once again worked with writers and producers from their debut, Kiss &amp; Tell such as Rock Mafia duo Tim James, and Antonina Armato, as well as Fefe Dobson, Toby Gad, and Superspy. New contributions came from Kevin Rudolf, Katy Perry, Jonas Jeberg and RedOne among others. Due to the success of their breakout hit, "Naturally", the album draws mainly from dance-pop, rather than the pop rock sound of Kiss &amp; Tell. While making use of the Auto-Tune effect, the album is also electropop, and infuses influences of several other genres, including dancehall, techno, and R&amp;B, among others. According to Gomez, most of the songs on the album are dedicated to the fans, while she wanted content with more melodies and empowering lyrics. Lyrical themes include topics of love, freedom, and the joy of living in the moment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/AYearWithoutRain.jpg/220px-AYearWithoutRain.jpg
