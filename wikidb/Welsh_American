15.70	Welsh_American	Welsh American	Welsh Americans are citizens of the United States whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in Wales. In the 2008 U.S. Census community survey, an estimated 1.98 million Americans had Welsh ancestry, 0.6% of the total U.S. population. This compares with a population of 3 million in Wales. However, 3.8% of Americans bear a Welsh surname. Moreover, a particularly large proportion of the African American population have Welsh names. History shows that there is little evidence that the Welsh were among the slave-owning classes at this time, as most immigrants were poor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/T_Jefferson_by_Charles_Willson_Peale_1791_2.jpg/108px-T_Jefferson_by_Charles_Willson_Peale_1791_2.jpg
