102.4	Enterprise_social_software	Enterprise social software	Enterprise social software (also known as or regarded as a major component of Enterprise 2.0), comprises social software as used in "enterprise" contexts. It includes social and networked modifications to corporate intranets and other classic software platforms used by large companies to organize their communication. In contrast to traditional enterprise software, which imposes structure prior to use, enterprise social software tends to encourage use prior to providing structure.
