63.7	Rumspringa	Rumspringa	Rumspringa (Pennsylvania Dutch: ; a noun derived from to the Pennsylvania "Dutch" German verb term rumspringen "to run around") generally refers to a period of adolescence for some members of the Amish, a subsect of the Anabaptist Christian movement, that begins around the age of 16 and ends when a youth chooses baptism within the Amish church or instead leaves the community.:10â€“11 The vast majority choose baptism and remain in the church. Not all Amish use this term (it does not occur in John Hostetler's extended discussion of adolescence among the Amish), but in sects that do, Amish elders generally view it as a time for courtship and finding a spouse.:14 Wenger Mennonites youth go through a period of rumspringa between ages 16 and 18. It is sometimes referred to as a period to "sow wild oats."
