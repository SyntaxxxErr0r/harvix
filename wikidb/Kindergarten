60.7	Kindergarten	Kindergarten	A kindergarten (from German ·), literally "children's garden") is a preschool educational institution for children. The term was created by Friedrich Fröbel for the play and activity institute that he created in 1837 in Bad Blankenburg as a social experience for children for their transition from home to school. His goal was that children should be taken care of and nourished in "children's gardens" like plants in a garden.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Frederick-Froebel-Bardeen.jpeg/170px-Frederick-Froebel-Bardeen.jpeg
