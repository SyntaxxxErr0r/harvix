Under STV, an elector's vote is initially allocated to his or her most-preferred candidate. After candidates have been either elected by reaching quota or eliminated (losers), surplus votes are transferred from winners to remaining candidates (hopefuls) according to the surplus ballots' ordered preferences.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/The_Wright_System_Flow_Chart.PNG/250px-The_Wright_System_Flow_Chart.PNG
