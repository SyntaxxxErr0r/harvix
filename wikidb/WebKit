199.6	WebKit	WebKit	WebKit is a layout engine designed to allow web browsers to render web pages. WebKit powers the Apple Safari and Google Chrome browsers that as of February 2012 held nearly 36% of the browser market share between them (according to StatCounter). It is also used as the basis for the experimental browser included with the Amazon Kindle ebook reader, as well as the default browser in the iOS, Android, BlackBerry Tablet OS and webOS mobile operating systems. The WebKit engine provides a set of classes to display web content in windows, and implements browser features such as following links when clicked by the user, managing a back-forward list, and managing a history of pages recently visited.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Webkit_Logo.png/150px-Webkit_Logo.png
