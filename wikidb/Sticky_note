10.10	Sticky_note	Post-it note	A Post-it note (or Sticky Note) is a piece of stationery with a re-adherable strip of adhesive on the back, designed for temporarily attaching notes to documents and other surfaces. Although now available in a wide range of colours, shapes, and sizes, Post-it notes are most commonly a 3-inch (76 mm) square, canary yellow in colour. A unique low-tack adhesive allows the notes to be easily attached and removed without leaving marks or residue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/PostIt.PNG
