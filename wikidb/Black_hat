97.3	Black_hat	Black hat	A black hat is the villain or bad guy, especially in a western movie in which such a character would stereotypically wear a black hat in contrast to the hero's white hat, especially in black and white movies. In Jewish circles, it refers to the more orthodox Jews who wear large-brimmed black hats. The phrase is often used figuratively, especially in computing slang, where it refers to a computer security hacker who breaks into networks or computers, or creates computer viruses.
