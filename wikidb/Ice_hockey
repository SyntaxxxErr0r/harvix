139.2	Ice_hockey	Ice hockey	Ice hockey, or hockey, is a team sport played on ice, in which skaters use wooden or composite sticks to shoot a hard rubber puck into their opponent's net. In regions where it is popular, the game is often referred to simply as hockey. The game is played between two teams with six players on the ice. A team usually consists of four lines of three forwards, 3 pairs of defencemen and two goalies. Five members of each team skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. Each team has a goaltender who tries to stop the puck from going into the goal or "net".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Ice_Hockey_sharks_ducks.jpg/300px-Ice_Hockey_sharks_ducks.jpg
