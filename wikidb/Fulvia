23.41	Fulvia	Fulvia	Fulvia Flacca Bambula (c. 83 BC â€“ 40 BC), commonly referred to as simply Fulvia, was an aristocratic Roman woman who lived during the Late Roman Republic. Through her marriage to three of the most promising Roman men of her generation, Publius Clodius Pulcher, Gaius Scribonius Curio and Mark Antony, she gained access to power. All three husbands were politically active populares, tribunes and supporters of Julius Caesar. Though she is more famous for her involvement in Antony's career, many scholars believe that she was politically active with all of her husbands.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Fulvia_Antonia.jpg/350px-Fulvia_Antonia.jpg
