4.20	Zerbert	Blowing a raspberry	Blowing a raspberry or strawberry or making a Bronx cheer is to make a noise signifying derision, real or feigned. It is made by placing the tongue between the lips and blowing, making a sound redolent of flatulence. In the terminology of phonetics, this sound can be described as an unvoiced linguolabial trill . It is never used in human language phonemically (i.e., to be used as a building block of words), but it is widely used across human cultures.
