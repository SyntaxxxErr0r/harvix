83.9	Total_internal_reflection	Total internal reflection	Total internal reflection is an optical phenomenon that happens when a ray of light strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger than a particular critical angle with respect to the normal to the surface. If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, no light can pass through and all of the light is reflected. The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/R%C3%A9flexion_total.svg/200px-R%C3%A9flexion_total.svg.png
