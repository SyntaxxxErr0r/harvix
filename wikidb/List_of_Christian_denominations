57.2	List_of_Christian_denominations	List of Christian denominations	Some groups included do not consider themselves a denomination (e.g., the Catholic Church considers itself the one true Church, and as pre-denominational). Regarding the use of the word "church," the Catholic Church does not consider any groups or denominations to be true "churches" unless they have maintained apostolic succession and observe the seven sacraments (by this definition, the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East, and a few other churches (PNCC, some Old Catholics, etc.) are, for the most part, the only other Christian groupings considered by the Catholic Church to be true "churches").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/ChristianityBranches.svg/659px-ChristianityBranches.svg.png
