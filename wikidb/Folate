57.1	Folate	Folic acid	Folic acid (also known as vitamin B9, vitamin Bc or folacin) and folate (the form naturally occurring in the body), as well as pteroyl-L-glutamic acid, pteroyl-L-glutamate, and pteroylmonoglutamic acid are forms of the water-soluble vitamin B9. Folic acid is itself not biologically active, but its biological importance is due to tetrahydrofolate and other derivatives after its conversion from dihydrofolic acid in the liver.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Folic_acid_%282%29.svg/150px-Folic_acid_%282%29.svg.png
