70.2	Suffragette	Suffragette	"Suffragette" is a term coined by the Daily Mail newspaper as a derogatory label for members of the late 19th and early 20th century movement for women's suffrage in the United Kingdom, in particular members of the Women's Social and Political Union. However, after former and then active members of the movement began to reclaim the word, the term became a label without negative connotations. It derives from the term "suffragist," which proponents of women's "suffrage," or right to vote, originally adopted. They wanted to be involved in the running of the country and they wanted to be treated as equals to men.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/British_suffragette_clipped.jpg/220px-British_suffragette_clipped.jpg
