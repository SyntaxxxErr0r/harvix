2.00	Living_In_Clip	Living in Clip	Living in Clip is a live album by singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco, released in 1997. The title is from a comment made by live sound engineer Larry Berger, indicating that the amplifiers weren't merely being overdriven into clipping occasionally (which is not uncommon in live sound situations); they were clipping so much that they were "living in clip". Rolling Stone named it one of the "The Essential Recordings of the â€˜90s".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/Ani_DiFranco_-_Living_in_Clip.jpg
