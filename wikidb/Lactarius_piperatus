4.00	Lactarius_piperatus	Lactarius piperatus	Lactarius piperatus, commonly known as the peppery milk-cap is a semi-edible basidiomycete fungus of the genus Lactarius. Despite being edible, it is not recommended due to its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactarius piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found on the forest floor in deciduous woodland.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Lactarius_piperatus_98569.jpg/234px-Lactarius_piperatus_98569.jpg
