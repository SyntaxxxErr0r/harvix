146.1	Roller_derby	Roller derby	Roller derby is a contact sport played by two teams of five members roller skating in the same direction around a track. Game play consists of a series of short matchups ("jams") in which both teams designate a scoring player (the "jammer") who scores points by lapping members of the opposing team. The teams attempt to assist their own jammer while hindering the opposing jammer â€”in effect playing both offense and defense simultaneously. Roller derby is played by more than 1,200 amateur leagues on every inhabited continent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/ComeAndGetIt136421766.jpg/300px-ComeAndGetIt136421766.jpg
