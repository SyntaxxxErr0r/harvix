97.8	Don_LaFontaine	Don LaFontaine	Donald Leroy "Don" LaFontaine (August 26, 1940 – September 1, 2008) was an American voice actor famous for recording more than 5,000 film trailers and hundreds of thousands of television advertisements, network promotions, and video game trailers. His nicknames included "Thunder Throat" and "The Voice of God". He became identified with the phrase "In a world…", which has been used in movie trailers so frequently that it has become a cliché. He parodied his career several times, most recently in commercials for GEICO insurance and the Mega Millions lottery game.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Don_LaFontaine.jpg/220px-Don_LaFontaine.jpg
