64.5	Color_vision	Color vision	Color vision is the capacity of an organism or machine to distinguish objects based on the wavelengths (or frequencies) of the light they reflect, emit, or transmit. Colors can be measured and quantified in various ways; indeed, a human's perception of colors is a subjective process whereby the brain responds to the stimuli that are produced when incoming light reacts with the several types of cone photoreceptors in the eye.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Psychophysical.svg/220px-Psychophysical.svg.png
