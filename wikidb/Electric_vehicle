Three main types of electric vehicles exist, those that are directly powered from an external power station, those that are powered by stored electricity originally from an external power source, and those that are powered by an on-board electrical generator, such as an internal combustion engine (a hybrid electric vehicle) or a hydrogen fuel cell. Electric vehicles include electric cars, electric trains, electric lorries, electric aeroplanes, electric boats, electric motorcycles and scooters and electric spacecraft.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Nissan_Leaf_aan_Amsterdamse_laadpaal.jpg/280px-Nissan_Leaf_aan_Amsterdamse_laadpaal.jpg
