216.2	Cell_(biology)	Cell (biology)	The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all known living organisms. It is the smallest unit of life that is classified as a living thing, and is often called the building block of life. Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell; including most bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals). Humans contain about 10 trillion (1013) cells. Most plant and animal cells are between 1 and 100 Âµm and therefore are visible only under the microscope.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Wilson1900Fig2.jpg/350px-Wilson1900Fig2.jpg
