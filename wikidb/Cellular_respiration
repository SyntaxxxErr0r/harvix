63.2	Cellular_respiration	Cellular respiration	Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions that involve the redox reaction (oxidation of one molecule and the reduction of another). Respiration is one of the key ways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular changes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/CellRespiration.svg/300px-CellRespiration.svg.png
