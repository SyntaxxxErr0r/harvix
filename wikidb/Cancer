375.4	Cancer	Cancer	Determining what causes cancer is complex. Many things are known to increase the risk of cancer, including tobacco use, certain infections, radiation, lack of physical activity, poor diet and obesity, and environmental pollutants. These can directly damage genes or combine with existing genetic faults within cells to cause the disease. Approximately five to ten percent of cancers are entirely hereditary.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Tumor_Mesothelioma2_legend.jpg/230px-Tumor_Mesothelioma2_legend.jpg
