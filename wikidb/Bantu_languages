87.7	Bantu_languages	Bantu languages	The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages, constitute a traditional sub-branch of the Nigerâ€“Congo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and Ethnologue counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of the present day country of Cameroon; i.e., in the regions commonly known as central Africa, east Africa, and southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/African_language_families_en.svg/350px-African_language_families_en.svg.png
