55.4	Squat_toilet	Squat toilet	A squat toilet (also known as an Arabic, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Iranian, Indian, Turkish or Natural-Position toilet; or Nile pan) is a toilet used by squatting, rather than sitting. There are several types of squat toilets, but they all consist essentially of a hole in the ground. The only exception is a "pedestal" squat toilet, which is of the same height as a sitting toilet. It is also possible to squat over sitting toilets, but this requires extra care as they are not specifically designed for squatting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Squat-toilet-with-tank.jpg/220px-Squat-toilet-with-tank.jpg
