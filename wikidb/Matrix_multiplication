54.6	Matrix_multiplication	Matrix multiplication	In mathematics, matrix multiplication is a binary operation that takes a pair of matrices, and produces another matrix. If A is an n-by-m matrix and B is an m-by-p matrix, the result AB of their multiplication is an n-by-p matrix defined only if the number of columns m of the left matrix A is equal to the number of rows of the right matrix B.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Matrix_multiplication_diagram_2.svg/313px-Matrix_multiplication_diagram_2.svg.png
