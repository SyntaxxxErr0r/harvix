1.00	ENCODE_(ENCyclopedia_Of_DNA_Elements)	ENCODE	ENCODE (the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) is a public research consortium launched by the US National Human Genome Research Institute in September 2003. The goal is to find all functional elements in the human genome, one of the most critical projects by NHGRI after it completed the successful Human Genome Project. All data generated in the course of the project will be released rapidly into public databases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/EncodeSample.png/200px-EncodeSample.png
