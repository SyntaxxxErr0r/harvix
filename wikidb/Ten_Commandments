251.5	Ten_Commandments	Ten Commandments	The Ten Commandments, also known as the Decalogue (Greek: ), are a set of biblical principles relating to ethics and worship, which play a fundamental role in Judaism and most forms of Christianity. They include instructions to worship only God and to keep the Sabbath, and prohibitions against idolatry, blasphemy, murder, theft, and adultery. Different groups follow slightly different traditions for interpreting and numbering them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Decalogue_parchment_by_Jekuthiel_Sofer_1768.jpg/220px-Decalogue_parchment_by_Jekuthiel_Sofer_1768.jpg
