The SiP performs all or most of the functions of an electronic system, and are typically used inside a mobile phone, digital music player, etc. Dies containing integrated circuits, may be stacked vertically on a substrate. They are internally connected by fine wires that are bonded to the package. Alternatively, with a flip chip technology, solder bumps are used to join stacked chips together.
