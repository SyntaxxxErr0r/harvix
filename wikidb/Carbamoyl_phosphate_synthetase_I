1.20	Carbamoyl_phosphate_synthetase_I	Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I	Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I is a ligase enzyme located in the mitochondria involved in the production of urea. Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I (CPSI) transfers an ammonia from glutamine to a molecule of bicarbonate that has been phosphorylated by a molecule of ATP. The resulting carbamate is then phosphorylated with another molecule ATP. The resulting molecule of carbamoyl phosphate leaves the enzyme.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Carbamoyl_phosphate_synthetase.JPG/350px-Carbamoyl_phosphate_synthetase.JPG
