The track became the group's best-selling single to that point, peaking at #7 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was featured on the soundtrack of cult British surf movie Blue Juice. The song gained recognition for its popular B-Side, "Space Clav", which has never been included on any other Jamiroquai release. With the exception of its inclusion on both regular and deluxe japanese pressings, it is one of only four singles that does not appear on the group's greatest hits record.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a6/Halftheman.jpg/220px-Halftheman.jpg
