65.9	Panic_of_1893	Panic of 1893	The Panic of 1893 was a serious economic depression in the United States that began in 1893. Similar to the Panic of 1873, this panic was marked by the collapse of railroad overbuilding and shaky railroad financing which set off a series of bank failures. Compounding market overbuilding and the railroad bubble, was a run on the gold supply (relative to silver), because of the long-established American policy of bimetallism, which used both silver and gold metals at a fixed 16:1 rate for pegging the value of the US Dollar. Until the Great Depression of 1929, the Panic of '93 was the worst economic depression the United States had ever experienced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/War_of_wealth_bank_run_poster.jpg/280px-War_of_wealth_bank_run_poster.jpg
