1.00	Mother_Bombie	Mother Bombie	Mother Bombie is an Elizabethan era stage play, a comedy by John Lyly. It is unique in Lyly's dramatic canon as a work of farce and social realism; in Mother Bombie alone, Lyly departs from his dream world of classical allusion and courtly comedy to create a "vulgar realistic play of rustic life" in a contemporaneous England.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Mother_bombie.jpg/200px-Mother_bombie.jpg
