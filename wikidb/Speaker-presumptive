2.00	Speaker-presumptive	Speaker-presumptive	A Speaker-presumptive is a member of a House of Representatives or other lower House who has not yet been formally selected as Speaker of the House, but who it is assumed will be at the next available opportunity. Typically, this applies to a Minority Leader who is expected to become Speaker upon a change of majority in the House. It differs from the term Speaker-designate in that a Speaker-designate has been formally elected to the Speakership, but has not formally taken office.
