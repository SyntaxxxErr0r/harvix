61.6	Pocahontas	Pocahontas	Pocahontas (born Matoaka, and later known as Rebecca Rolfe, c. 1595 â€“ March 1617) was a Virginia Indian notable for her association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. She was the daughter of Chief Powhatan, the head of a network of tributary tribal nations in the Tidewater region of Virginia. In a well-known historical anecdote, she is said to have saved the life of an Indian captive, Englishman John Smith, in 1607 by placing her head upon his own when her father raised his war club to execute him.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Pocahontas_by_Simon_van_de_Passe_1616.jpg/225px-Pocahontas_by_Simon_van_de_Passe_1616.jpg
