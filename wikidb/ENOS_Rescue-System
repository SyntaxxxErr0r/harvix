2.00	ENOS_Rescue-System	ENOS Rescue-System	Each ENOS unit consists of two parts. The ENOS-Receiver which is kept on board the dive boat; and the ENOS-Transmitter(s) carried by the diver(s). ENOS is designed for emergencies associated with a diver(s) surfacing too far from the boat to swim back. For example, when divers have been swept away from their vessel by a current or when they can’t see the boat because of poor weather. To send an emergency signal, the diver switches on the transmitter. This will send the signal and the diver’s GPS position back to the boat’s receiver. When the receiver picks up the diver’s alert, it automatically determines the boat’s GPS position and calculates the vessel’s distance and bearing to the diver’s position. The results are clearly plotted on screen for the skipper to follow during the rescue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/ENOS-System.JPG/220px-ENOS-System.JPG
