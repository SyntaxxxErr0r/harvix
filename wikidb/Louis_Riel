55.7	Louis_Riel	Louis Riel	Louis David Riel (22 October 1844 – 16 November 1885) was a Canadian politician, a founder of the province of Manitoba, and a political and spiritual leader of the Métis people of the Canadian prairies. He led two resistance movements against the Canadian government and its first post-Confederation Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald. Riel sought to preserve Métis rights and culture as their homelands in the Northwest came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence. He is regarded by many as a Canadian folk hero today.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Louis_Riel.jpg/240px-Louis_Riel.jpg
