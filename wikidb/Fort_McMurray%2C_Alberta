2.40	Fort_McMurray%2C_Alberta	Fort McMurray	Fort McMurray is an urban service area in the Regional Municipality (R.M.) of Wood Buffalo in Alberta, Canada. It was previously incorporated as a city on September 1, 1980. It became an urban service area when it amalgamated with Improvement District No. 143 on April 1, 1995 to create the Municipality of Wood Buffalo (later renamed to the R.M. of Wood Buffalo on August 14, 1996). Despite its current official designation of urban service area, many locals, politicians and the media still refer to Fort McMurray as a city.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Fort_mcmurray_aerial.jpg/250px-Fort_mcmurray_aerial.jpg
