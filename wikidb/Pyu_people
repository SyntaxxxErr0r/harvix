1.00	Pyu_people	Pyu city-states	Pyu city states were a group of city-states that existed from c. 2nd century BCE to c. mid-11th century CE in present-day Upper Burma (Myanmar). The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu, the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant. The thousand-year period, often referred to as the Pyu millennium, linked the bronze age to the beginning of the classical states period when the Pagan Dynasty emerged in the late 9th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Pyu_Realm.png/250px-Pyu_Realm.png
