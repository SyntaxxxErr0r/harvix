60.0	DIY_ethic	DIY ethic	The DIY ethic refers to the ethic of self-sufficiency through completing tasks oneself, as opposed to having others who are more experienced or able complete them on one's behalf. Literally meaning "do it yourself," it promotes the idea that an ordinary person can learn to do more than just what he or she may have thought was possible. Naturally, a DIY attitude requires that the adherent attain as well as retain the knowledge required to complete a given task. Without this, DIY is an ineffective dogma. The term can refer to "doing" anything at all, including home improvements and repairs, first aid, or even creative endeavors.
