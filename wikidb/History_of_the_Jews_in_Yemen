1.00	History_of_the_Jews_in_Yemen	Yemenite Jews	Yemenite Jews are those Jews who live, or whose recent ancestors lived, in Yemen (תֵּימָן, Standard Teman Tiberian ; "far south"). Between June 1949 and September 1950, the overwhelming majority of Yemen's Jewish population was transported to Israel in Operation Magic Carpet. Most Yemenite Jews now live in Israel, with some others in the United States, and fewer elsewhere. Only a handful remain in Yemen, mostly elderly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Yemen-map.png/250px-Yemen-map.png
