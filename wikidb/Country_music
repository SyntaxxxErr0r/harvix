Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjoes, electric and acoustic guitars, fiddles such as violins, and harmonicas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Rymanauditorium1.jpg/220px-Rymanauditorium1.jpg
