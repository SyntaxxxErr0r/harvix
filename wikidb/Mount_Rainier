103.6	Mount_Rainier	Mount Rainier	Mount Rainier is a massive stratovolcano located 54 miles (87 km) southeast of Seattle in the state of Washington, United States. It is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous United States and the Cascade Volcanic Arc, with a summit elevation of 14,411 ft (4,392 m). Mt. Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, and it is on the Decade Volcano list. Because of its large amount of glacial ice, Mt. Rainier could potentially produce massive lahars that would threaten the whole Puyallup River valley.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Mount_Rainier_5917s.JPG/280px-Mount_Rainier_5917s.JPG
