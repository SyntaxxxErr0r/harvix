56.9	Omar_Abdel-Rahman	Omar Abdel-Rahman	Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman (Arabic: ‎, ‘Umar ‘Abd ar-Raḥman; born 3 May 1938), commonly known in the United States as "The Blind Sheikh", is a blind Egyptian Muslim leader who is currently serving a life sentence at the Butner Medical Center which is part of the Butner Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, United States. Formerly a resident of New York City, Abdel-Rahman and nine others were convicted of seditious conspiracy, which requires only that a crime be planned, not that it necessarily be attempted. His prosecution grew out of investigations of the World Trade Center 1993 bombings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Omar_Abdel-Rahman.jpg/200px-Omar_Abdel-Rahman.jpg
