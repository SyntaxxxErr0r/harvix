51.0	Arnold_Palmer	Arnold Palmer	Arnold Daniel Palmer (born September 10, 1929) is an American professional golfer, who is generally regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of men's professional golf. He has won numerous events on both the PGA Tour and Champions Tour, dating back to 1955. Nicknamed "The King," he is one of golf's most popular stars and its most important trailblazer, because he was the first superstar of the sport's television age, which began in the 1950s. He is part of "The Big Three" in golf, along with Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, who are widely credited with popularizing and commercialising the sport around the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/ArnoldPalmerCoastGuard1953.jpg/250px-ArnoldPalmerCoastGuard1953.jpg
