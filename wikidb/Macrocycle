7.21	Macrocycle	Macrocycle	The macrocyclic effect was discovered in 1969.

This property of coordinating macrocyclic molecules is the macrocycle effect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Cyclen_Zinc_InorgChem_1997_4579_commons.jpg/175px-Cyclen_Zinc_InorgChem_1997_4579_commons.jpg
