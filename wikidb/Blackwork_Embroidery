8.03	Blackwork_Embroidery	Blackwork Embroidery	Blackwork Embroidery is a form embroidery using black thread. Sometimes it is counted-thread embroidery which is usually stitched on even-weave fabric. Any black thread can be used, but firmly twisted threads give a better look than embroidery floss. Traditionally blackwork is stitched in silk thread on white or off-white linen or cotton fabric. Sometimes metallic threads or coloured threads are used for accents.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Blackwork_embroidery_1530s_and_1590s.png/220px-Blackwork_embroidery_1530s_and_1590s.png
