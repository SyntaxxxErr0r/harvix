54.6	Ray_tracing_(graphics)	Ray tracing (graphics)	In computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism, usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost. This makes ray tracing best suited for applications where the image can be rendered slowly ahead of time, such as in still images and film and television special effects, and more poorly suited for real-time applications like video games where speed is critical. Ray tracing is capable of simulating a wide variety of optical effects, such as reflection and refraction, scattering, and dispersion phenomena (such as chromatic aberration).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Recursive_raytrace_of_a_sphere.png/250px-Recursive_raytrace_of_a_sphere.png
