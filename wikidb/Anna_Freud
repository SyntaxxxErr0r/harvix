54.4	Anna_Freud	Anna Freud	Anna Freud (3 December 1895 â€“ 9 October 1982) was the sixth and last child of Sigmund and Martha Freud. Born in Vienna, she followed the path of her father and contributed to the newly born field of psychoanalysis. Alongside Melanie Klein, she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology: as her father put it, child analysis 'had received a powerful impetus through "the work of Frau Melanie Klein and of my daughter, Anna Freud"'. Compared to her father, her work emphasized the importance of the ego and its ability to be trained socially.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Sigmund_en_Anna.jpg/220px-Sigmund_en_Anna.jpg
