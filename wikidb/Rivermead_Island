It is unpopulated, being a large area of open space. It is connected to the bank by a footbridge, and vehicle access is possible via a ford of the narrow stream separating it from the land. The Sunbury Amateur Regatta takes place here usually in August each year.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Rivermeadisle01.JPG/220px-Rivermeadisle01.JPG
