60.2	Sympathetic_nervous_system	Sympathetic nervous system	The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the three parts of the autonomic nervous system, along with the enteric and parasympathetic systems.

It is, however, constantly active at a basal level to maintain homeostasis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Gray838.png/250px-Gray838.png
