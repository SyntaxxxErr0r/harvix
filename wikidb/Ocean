109.4	Ocean	Ocean	An ocean (from Greek , "okeanos" Oceanus) is a body of saline water that composes a large part of a planet's hydrosphere. In the context of Earth, it also refers to major divisions of the planet's World Ocean, such as the Atlantic Ocean. The word "sea" is often used interchangeably with "ocean", but a sea is a body of saline water in a more inland location rather than a location in which it encompasses the land around it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Clouds_over_the_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg/220px-Clouds_over_the_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg
