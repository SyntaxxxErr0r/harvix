6.40	Sarah_Trimmer	Sarah Trimmer	Sarah Trimmer (née Kirby; 6 January 1741 – 15 December 1810) was a writer and critic of 18th-century British children's literature. Her periodical, The Guardian of Education, helped to define the emerging genre by seriously reviewing children's literature for the first time; it also provided the first history of children's literature, establishing a canon of the early landmarks of the genre that scholars still use today. Trimmer's most popular children's book, Fabulous Histories, inspired numerous children's animal stories and remained in print for over a century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Sarah_Trimmer_by_Henry_Howard.jpg/220px-Sarah_Trimmer_by_Henry_Howard.jpg
