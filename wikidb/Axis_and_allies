8.01	Axis_and_allies	Axis &amp; Allies	Axis &amp; Allies is a popular series of World War II strategy board games, with nearly two million copies printed. Originally designed by Larry Harris and published by Nova Game Designs in 1981, the game was republished by the Milton Bradley Company in 1984 as part of the Gamemaster Series of board games. This edition would be retroactively named Axis &amp; Allies: Classic to differentiate it from later revisions. In 1996, Axis &amp; Allies: Classic was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame. Games magazine also has inducted Axis &amp; Allies into their buyers' guide Hall of Fame., an honor the magazine extends to "games that have met or exceeded the highest standards of quality and play value and have been continuously in production for at least 10 years; i.e., classics."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/AxisAndAlliesBox.jpg
