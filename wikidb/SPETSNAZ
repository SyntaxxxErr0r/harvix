2.00	SPETSNAZ	Spetsnaz	Spetsnaz tr: Voyska spetsialnogo naznacheniya; pronounced ) is an umbrella term for any special forces in Russian, literally "special purpose forces". The term can specifically refer to any elite or special purpose units under subordination of the Federal Security Service (FSB) or Internal Troops of Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the units controlled by the military intelligence service GRU. Spetsnaz are known as some of the best trained special forces in the world and act much like Delta Force in the US Army. Their hand to hand fighting is extremely well implemented as they require special physical requirements to even get into training. It is rumored around 85% of the trainees fail and 3% will sustain some kind of injury or die. The Spetsnaz in the Cold War wore Red Berets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/23osn_Mechel.jpg/180px-23osn_Mechel.jpg
