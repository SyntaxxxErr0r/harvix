1.10	Mapserver	MapServer	MapServer is an open source development environment for building spatially enabled internet applications. It can run as a CGI program or via MapScript which supports several programming languages (using SWIG). MapServer was developed by the University of Minnesota â€” so, it is often and more specifically referred as "UMN MapServer", to distinguish it from commercial "map server". MapServer was originally developed with support from NASA, which needed a way to make its satellite imagery available to the public.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/MapServer.png
