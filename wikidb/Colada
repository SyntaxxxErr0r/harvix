3.01	Colada	Colada	Colada is one of the two best-known swords, along with Tizona, of El Cid Campeador. Won in combat from the Count of Barcelona, the sword was presented (along with Tizona) to his sons in law. According to the heroic verses of the Cantar de mio Cid, after his sons-in-law beat his daughters and then abandoned them on the side of the road, El Cid asked his gifts to be returned. Afterward, he bestowed the sword upon one of his knights, Martín Antolínez.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Degen_-_Fig._1%2C2%2C12._Neue_preu%C3%9Fische_Degen._%E2%80%93_3_u._4_Degen_Philipps_II._von_Spanien._%E2%80%93_5._Degen_....jpg/300px-Degen_-_Fig._1%2C2%2C12._Neue_preu%C3%9Fische_Degen._%E2%80%93_3_u._4_Degen_Philipps_II._von_Spanien._%E2%80%93_5._Degen_....jpg
