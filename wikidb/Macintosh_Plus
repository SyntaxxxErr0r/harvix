55.6	Macintosh_Plus	Macintosh Plus	The Macintosh Plus computer was the third model in the Macintosh line, introduced on January 16, 1986, two years after the original Macintosh and a little more than a year after the Macintosh 512K, with a price tag of US$2599. As an evolutionary improvement over the 512K, it shipped with 1 MB of RAM standard, expandable to 4 MB, and an external SCSI peripheral bus, among smaller improvements. It originally had the same generally beige-colored case as the original Macintosh ("Pantone 453"), but in 1987, the case color was changed to the long-lived, warm gray "Platinum" color. It is the earliest Macintosh model able to run System 7 OS.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/MacIntosh_Plus_img_1317.jpg/220px-MacIntosh_Plus_img_1317.jpg
