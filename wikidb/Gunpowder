60.2	Gunpowder	Gunpowder	Gunpowder, also known since the late 19th century as black powder, was the first chemical explosive and the only one known until the mid 1800s. It is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate (saltpeter) - with the sulfur and charcoal acting as fuels, while the saltpeter works as an oxidizer. Because of its burning properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms and as a pyrotechnic composition in fireworks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9c/Black_Powder_Close_Up.jpg/220px-Black_Powder_Close_Up.jpg
