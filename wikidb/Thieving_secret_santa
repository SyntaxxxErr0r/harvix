Generally, white elephant parties need a minimum of six participants. With a larger group, game play may be more protracted. White elephant parties have been known to result in playful rivalries between players trying to get sought after gifts. The goal of a white elephant party is usually to entertain rather than to gain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/White_elephant_gift_exchange.jpg/220px-White_elephant_gift_exchange.jpg
