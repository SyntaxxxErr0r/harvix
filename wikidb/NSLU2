94.2	NSLU2	NSLU2	The NSLU2 (Network Storage Link for USB 2.0 Disk Drives) is a Network-attached storage (NAS) device made by Linksys introduced in 2004 and discontinued in 2008. It makes USB Flash memory and hard disks accessible over a network using the SMB protocol (also known as Windows file sharing or CIFS). It was superseded mainly by the NAS200 (enclosure type storage link) and in another sense by the WRT600N and WRT300N/350N which both combine a wifi router with a storage link.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/NSLU2_Front_resized.jpg/125px-NSLU2_Front_resized.jpg
