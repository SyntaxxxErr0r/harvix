55.7	Portuguese_Man_o'_War	Portuguese Man o' War	The Portuguese man o' war , also known as the Portuguese man-of-war, man-of-war, or bluebottle, is a jelly-like marine invertebrate of the family Physaliidae. Its venomous tentacles can deliver a powerful sting. The name "man o' war" might be taken from the man-of-war, a 16th century English armed sailing ship that was based on an earlier Portuguese vessel, but a closer relation is that the floats of the jelly greatly resembled the morion helmets of the Portuguese soldiers in the 15th to 16th centuries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Portuguese_Man-O-War_%28Physalia_physalis%29.jpg/220px-Portuguese_Man-O-War_%28Physalia_physalis%29.jpg
