68.7	White_matter	White matter	White matter is one of the two components of the central nervous system and consists mostly of glial cells and myelinated axons that transmit signals from one region of the cerebrum to another and between the cerebrum and lower brain centers. White matter tissue of the freshly cut brain appears pinkish white to the naked eye because myelin is composed largely of lipid tissue veined with capillaries. Its white color is due to its usual preservation in formaldehyde.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Grey_matter_and_white_matter_-_very_high_mag.jpg/250px-Grey_matter_and_white_matter_-_very_high_mag.jpg
