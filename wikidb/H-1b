8.40	H-1b	H-1B visa	The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 101(a)(15)(H). It allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. If a foreign worker in H-1B status quits or is dismissed from the sponsoring employer, the worker must either apply for and be granted a change of status to another non-immigrant status, find another employer (subject to application for adjustment of status and/or change of visa), or leave the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/HIB_by_nation_2006_to_2008.svg/120px-HIB_by_nation_2006_to_2008.svg.png
