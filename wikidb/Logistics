71.1	Logistics	Logistics	Logistics is the management of the flow of goods between the point of origin and the point of destination in order to meet the requirements of customers or corporations. Logistics involves the integration of information, transportation, inventory, warehousing, material handling, and packaging, and often security. Today the complexity of production logistics can be modeled, analyzed, visualized and optimized by plant simulation software, but is constantly changing. This can involve anything from consumer goods such as food, to IT materials, to aerospace and defense equipment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/NHS_Logistics_MX51CHG.jpg/220px-NHS_Logistics_MX51CHG.jpg
