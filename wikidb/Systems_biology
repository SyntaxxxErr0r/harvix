85.6	Systems_biology	Systems biology	Systems biology is a term used to describe a number of trends in bioscience research, and a movement which draws on those trends. Proponents describe systems biology as a biology-based inter-disciplinary study field that focuses on complex interactions in biological systems, claiming that it uses a new perspective . Particularly from year 2000 onwards, the term is used widely in the biosciences, and in a variety of contexts. An often stated ambition of systems biology is the modeling and discovery of emergent properties, properties of a system whose theoretical description is only possible using techniques which fall under the remit of systems biology. These typically involve cell signaling networks, via long-range allostery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Genomics_GTL_Pictorial_Program.jpg/320px-Genomics_GTL_Pictorial_Program.jpg
