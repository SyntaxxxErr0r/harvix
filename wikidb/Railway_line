2.00	Railway_line	Glossary of rail transport terms	Rail terminology is a form of technical terminology. The difference between the American term railroad and the international term railway (used by the International Union of Railways and English-speaking countries outside the US) is the most obvious difference in rail terminology (see usage of the terms railroad and railway for more information). There are also others, due to the parallel development of rail transport systems in different parts of the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1c/440woodcut.jpg/150px-440woodcut.jpg
