57.3	Helios	Helios	Helios (Greek: "Sun", Latinized as Helius) was the personification of the Sun in Greek mythology. Homer often calls him simply Titan or Hyperion, while Hesiod (Theogony 371) and the Homeric Hymn separate him as a son of the Titans Hyperion and Theia (Hesiod) or Euryphaessa (Homeric Hymn) and brother of the goddesses Selene, the moon, and Eos, the dawn. The names of these three were also the common Greek words for Sun, Moon and dawn. Ovid also calls him Titan, in fact "lumina Titan".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Head_Helios_AM_Rhodes_E49.jpg/200px-Head_Helios_AM_Rhodes_E49.jpg
