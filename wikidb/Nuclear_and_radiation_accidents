53.5	Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents	Nuclear and radiation accidents	A nuclear and radiation accident is defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency as "an event that has led to significant consequences to people, the environment or the facility. Examples include lethal effects to individuals, large radioactivity release to the environment, or reactor core melt." The prime example of a "major nuclear accident" is one in which a reactor core is damaged and large amounts of radiation are released, such as in the Chernobyl Disaster in 1986.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Fukushima_I_by_Digital_Globe.jpg/220px-Fukushima_I_by_Digital_Globe.jpg
