139.1	Redshirt_(character)	Redshirt (character)	A "redshirt" is a stock character in fiction who dies soon after being introduced. The term originates with fans of Star Trek (1966â€“1969), from the red shirts worn by Starfleet security officers who frequently die during episodes. Redshirt deaths are often used to dramatize the potential peril that the main characters face.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Star_Trek_-_Obsession_%28screenshot_of_dead_redshirt%29.jpg
