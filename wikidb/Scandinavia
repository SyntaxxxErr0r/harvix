141.8	Scandinavia	Scandinavia	Scandinavia is a historical cultural-linguistic region in northern Europe that includes the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, characterized by their common ethno-cultural heritage and related languages. Modern Norway and Sweden proper are situated on the Scandinavian Peninsula, whereas modern Denmark is situated on the Danish islands and Jutland. The term Scandinavia is usually used as a cultural term, but in English usage, it is occasionally confused with the purely geographical term Scandinavian Peninsula, which overlaps with Scandinavia. Sometimes the term Scandinavia is also taken to include Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Finland, on account of their historical association with the Scandinavian countries. Such usage, however, is considered inaccurate in Scandinavia, where the term Nordic countries instead refers to this broader group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Scandinavia_M2002074_lrg.jpg/140px-Scandinavia_M2002074_lrg.jpg
