Formerly, all songs in the iTunes Store were encoded with FairPlay. Apple later started offering a selection of songs that, after an additional 50 cents is paid per song, could be downloaded FairPlay-free. Currently, in the US, Apple does not sell songs with FairPlay encryption . FairPlay digitally encrypts AAC audio files and prevents users from playing these files on unauthorized computers.
