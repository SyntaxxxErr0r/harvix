95.7	Karaoke	Karaoke	The concept of creating studio recordings that lack the lead vocal has been around for nearly as long as recording itself. Many artists, amateur and professional, perform in situations where a full band/orchestra is either logistically or financially impractical, so they use a "karaoke" recording; they are, however, the original artists. (This is not to be confused with "lip synching," in which a performer mimes to a previously produced studio recording with the lead vocal intact.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Karaoke_subtitle.jpg/220px-Karaoke_subtitle.jpg
