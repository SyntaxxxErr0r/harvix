3.00	Aortae	Aorta	The aorta (from Greek ἀορτή - aortē, from ἀείρω - aeirō "I lift, raise") is the largest artery in the body, originating from the left ventricle of the heart and extending down to the abdomen, where it bifurcates into two smaller arteries (the common iliacs). The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body through the systemic circulation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Aorta_scheme_noTags.svg/250px-Aorta_scheme_noTags.svg.png
