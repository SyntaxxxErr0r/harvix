The modern Comic Sans was designed by Vincent Connare and released in 1994 by Microsoft Corporation. It is classified as a casual, non-connecting script, and was designed to imitate the historical look of comic book lettering, for use in informal documents.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/ComicSansSpec3.svg/220px-ComicSansSpec3.svg.png
