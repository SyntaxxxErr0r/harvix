1.00	TSS_Dover	TSS Dover	TSS Dover, (later the Earl Siward, Sol Express and now the Tuxedo Royale), is a British built turbine steamship. Built in 1965 as a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferry, she spent much of her later life as a one of the permanently moored Tuxedo floating nightclubs before being stored out of use, latterly on the River Tees in Middlesbrough.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Tuxedo_Royal_by_Riverside_Stadium%2C_Middlesbrough_-_geograph.org.uk_-_105071.jpg/300px-Tuxedo_Royal_by_Riverside_Stadium%2C_Middlesbrough_-_geograph.org.uk_-_105071.jpg
