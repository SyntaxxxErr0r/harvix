7.33	Kenta_Cho	ABA Games	ABA Games is a Japanese video game developer, comprising solely of game designer Kenta Cho. ABA Games' works, available as open source freeware, are predominantly shoot 'em up games often inspired by classic games in the genre. Its games feature stylised retro graphics, innovative gameplay features and modes and are based around random rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed as some of the best and well-known independent games available, though some commentators, including Cho himself, feel they are too simple for commercial release.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f4/Aba_games_logo.gif/200px-Aba_games_logo.gif
