59.9	Dwight_Schrute	Dwight Schrute	Dwight Kurt Schrute III (January 27, 1970) is a character on NBC's The Office, portrayed by Rainn Wilson and based on Gareth Keenan from the original UK version of The Office, in terms of appearance. Dwight is the top Salesman and former acting manager for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, and has won numerous awards for his successes, despite lacking social skills and common sense. Despite his personal dislike of Jim Halpert, the two are an effective sales team. Dwight's ability as a salesman, though, has rarely commanded the respect of his peers or led to higher levels of professional success. Moreover, though at one time he was the Assistant to the Regional Manager, he was demoted to a debatable number three in the office after Jim came back from Stamford. Currently, while Andy Bernard is manager, Dwight resumed his post as Assistant To The Regional Manager.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Rainn_Wilson.jpg/250px-Rainn_Wilson.jpg
