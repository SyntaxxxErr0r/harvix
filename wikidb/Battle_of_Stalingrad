90.5	Battle_of_Stalingrad	Battle of Stalingrad	The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in southwestern Russia. The battle took place between 23 August 1942 and 2 February 1943. It was the largest battle on the Eastern Front and was marked by brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties. It is among the bloodiest battles in the history of warfare, with the higher estimates of combined casualties amounting to nearly two million. The heavy losses inflicted on the German army made it a turning point in the war. After the Battle of Stalingrad, German forces never recovered their earlier strength, and attained no further strategic victories in the East.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-W0506-316%2C_Russland%2C_Kampf_um_Stalingrad%2C_Siegesflagge.jpg/300px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-W0506-316%2C_Russland%2C_Kampf_um_Stalingrad%2C_Siegesflagge.jpg
