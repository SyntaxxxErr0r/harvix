2.00	Hubert_Shiffer	Hubert Schiffer	Father Hubert Schiffer, born in Germany in 1915, was one of eight Jesuits who survived the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. He was only eight blocks away from ground zero when the explosion occurred. Some Catholics believe the survival of the priests to have been a miracle. Skeptics counter that there were non-Catholic survivors even closer to the center of the blast, such as Eizo Nomura (100 m away) and Akiko Takakura (150 m away), and numerous survivors within a 1 km radius.
