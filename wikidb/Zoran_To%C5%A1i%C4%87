Born in Zrenjanin, Tošić began his career with his local side Proleter Zrenjanin. He then joined Budućnost Banatski Dvor, who then merged with Proleter to form Banat Zrenjanin. A year later, he signed for Serbian giants Partizan, for whom he played for two years before a high-profile move to Manchester United of England. After he struggled to break into the Red Devils first-team, he was sent on a six-month loan to German side Köln in January 2010, and was then transferred to CSKA Moscow of Russia that summer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Zoran_To%C5%A1i%C4%87_7333.jpg/200px-Zoran_To%C5%A1i%C4%87_7333.jpg
