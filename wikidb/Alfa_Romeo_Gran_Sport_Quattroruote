2.10	Alfa_Romeo_Gran_Sport_Quattroruote	Alfa Romeo Gran Sport Quattroruote	The Alfa Romeo Gran Sport Quattroruote is a two-seater roadster constructed between 1965 and 1967 by the Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo. The car is a "retro" replica of the 1930s 1750 Gran Sport model (although the engine is in straight-4 rather than straight-6 configuration), and was inspired by an article published in the Milan-based car magazine Quattroruote. The first prototype version was introduced in April 1965 in Turin, with the first production version being unveiled the next year at the New York Motor Show. Despite its appealing design, the car did not sell well: only 92 examples were sold.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Alfa_Romeo_Quattroruote_Zagato.jpg/250px-Alfa_Romeo_Quattroruote_Zagato.jpg
