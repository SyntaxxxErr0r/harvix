81.1	Second_Continental_Congress	Second Continental Congress	The Second Continental Congress was a convention of delegates from the Thirteen Colonies that started meeting on May 10, 1775, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, soon after warfare in the American Revolutionary War had begun. It succeeded the First Continental Congress, which met between September 5, 1774 and October 26, 1774, also in Philadelphia. The second Congress managed the colonial war effort, and moved incrementally towards independence, adopting the United States Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. By raising armies, directing strategy, appointing diplomats, and making formal treaties, the Congress acted as the de facto national government of what became the United States. With the ratification of the Articles of Confederation, the Congress became known as the Congress of the Confederation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Congress_voting_independence.jpg/250px-Congress_voting_independence.jpg
