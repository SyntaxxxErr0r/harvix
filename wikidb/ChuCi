1.00	ChuCi	Chu Ci	Chu Ci , also known as Songs of the South or Songs of Chu, is an anthology of Chinese verse traditionally attributed to Qu Yuan and Song Yu from the Warring States Period, though about half of the poems seem to have been composed several centuries later, during the Han Dynasty. The traditional version of the Chu Ci contains 17 major sections, and was produced by Wang Yi (Chinese: ), a 2nd century AD librarian who served under Emperor Shun of Han. The Chu Ci and the more well-known Shi Jing together constitute the classics of pre-Qin dynasty Chinese verse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/CMOC_Treasures_of_Ancient_China_exhibit_-_bronze_zhou_jie%2C_detail.jpg/220px-CMOC_Treasures_of_Ancient_China_exhibit_-_bronze_zhou_jie%2C_detail.jpg
