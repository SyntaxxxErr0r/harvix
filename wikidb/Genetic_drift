98.0	Genetic_drift	Genetic drift	Genetic drift or allelic drift is the change in the frequency of a gene variant in a population due to random sampling. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/220px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png
