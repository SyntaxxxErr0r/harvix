57.3	Theodicy	Theodicy	The term theodicy ( from Greek theos - "god" + dike - "justice") has no universally agreed upon definition, but usually refers to an attempt to resolve the evidential problem of evil and reconcile God's traditional characteristics of omnibenevolence, omnipotence and omniscience (all-loving, all-powerful, and all-knowing) with the occurrence of evil in the world. Although such arguments have existed for centuries, the term theodicy was coined in 1710 by German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz in his work, Théodicée.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg/220px-Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg
