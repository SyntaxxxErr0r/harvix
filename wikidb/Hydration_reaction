7.00	Hydration_reaction	Hydration reaction	In organic chemistry, a hydration reaction is a chemical reaction in which a hydroxyl group (OHâˆ’) and a hydrogen cation (an acidic proton) are added to the two carbon atoms bonded together in the carbon-carbon double bond which makes up an alkene functional group. The reaction usually runs in a strong acidic, aqueous solution. Hydration differs from hydrolysis in that hydrolysis cleaves the non-water component in two. Hydration leaves the non-water component intact.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Hydrationreaction.png
