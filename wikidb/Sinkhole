73.5	Sinkhole	Sinkhole	A sinkhole, also known as a sink, snake hole, swallow hole, swallet, doline or cenote, is a natural depression or hole in the Earth's surface caused by karst processes â€” the chemical dissolution of carbonate rocks or suffosion processes for example in sandstone. Sinkholes may vary in size from 1 to 600 meters (3.3 to 2,000 ft) both in diameter and depth, and vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms. Sinkholes may be formed gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide. The different terms for sinkholes are often used interchangeably.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Sink_hole.jpg/220px-Sink_hole.jpg
