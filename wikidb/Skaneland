1.00	Skaneland	Skåneland	Skåneland (Swedish) or Skånelandene (Danish) are terms used in historical contexts in Scandinavia to describe the area on the southern and south-western part of the Scandinavian peninsula, which under the Treaty of Roskilde (1658) was transferred from Denmark to Sweden. It corresponds to the provinces of Blekinge, Halland and Scania. The island of Bornholm, which in the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660) was returned to Denmark, is also often included in the term. Equivalent terms in English and Latin are ’’the Scanian provinces” and "Terrae Scaniae" respectivelly. The denomination is seldom used in everyday life or as a geographical region. Nowadays there is some confusion in the terminology. Sometimes the name Scania is in English also used for describing all of the Scanian provinces (i.e. Skåneland). On the other hand the term Skåneland is occasionally used to describe just the province of Scania (i.e. Skåne).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Map_sk%C3%A5neland_updated.png
