2.10	Alvord_Lake_Bridge	Alvord Lake Bridge	The Alvord Lake Bridge was the first reinforced concrete bridge built in America. It was built in 1889 by Ernest L. Ransome, an innovator in reinforced concrete design, mixing equipment, and construction systems. The bridge was constructed as a single arch 64 feet (20 m) wide with a 20-foot (6.1 m) span . Ransome is believed to have used his patented cold-twisted square steel bar for reinforcement, placed longitudinally in the arch and curved in the same arc. The face of the bridge was scored and hammered to resemble sandstone, the interior features concrete "stalactites" (some of which have subsequently grown due to redeposition of limestone from the concrete).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/HAER-Alvord_Lake.jpg/250px-HAER-Alvord_Lake.jpg
