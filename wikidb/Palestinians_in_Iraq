3.00	Palestinians_in_Iraq	Palestinians in Iraq	Palestinians in Iraq are people of Palestinian ancestry, some of whom have been residing in Iraq after they were forced to flee their homeland in 1948. Before 2003, there were approximately 34,000 Palestinians thought to be living in Iraq, mainly concentrated in Baghdad. However, since the 2003 Iraq war, the figure lies between 10,000 - 13,000, although a precise figures has been hard to determine. The situation of Palestinians in Iraq deteriorated after the fall of Saddam Hussein and particularly following the bombing of al-Askari mosque in 2006. Since then, with the rise in insecurity throughout Iraq, they have been the target of persecution and violence, with militant groups (mostly Shia) targeting them for (what the militant groups claim to have been) preferential treatment they received under Ba'th Party rule. Currently, several hundred Palestinians from Iraq are living in border camps, after being refused entry to neighbouring Jordan and Syria. Others have been resettled to third countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Iraq_Palestine_Locator.svg/250px-Iraq_Palestine_Locator.svg.png
