He greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles, and advocated the use of fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, as well as its various offshoots.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/John_Maynard_Keynes.jpg/180px-John_Maynard_Keynes.jpg
