1.00	Outside_In	Outside In	Outside In is a giant-screen art film composed entirely of still photographs from NASA solar system exploratory missions such as Cassiniâ€“Huygens giving audiences the outside in view of Earth only experienced by Apollo program astronauts. Originally planned as a short film, the initial scenes have been screened at the International Giant Screen Cinema trade show was well received leading to expansion to feature length taking viewers from the big-bang through the solar system to present day Saturn. Unlike most IMAX films which require millions to produce, Outside In is being produced in the filmmaker's basement with homebuilt computing equipment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cc/Outsideinlogo.jpg
