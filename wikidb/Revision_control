215.9	Revision_control	Revision control	Revision control, also known as version control and source control (and an aspect of software configuration management), is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Revision_controlled_project_visualization-2010-24-02.svg/220px-Revision_controlled_project_visualization-2010-24-02.svg.png
