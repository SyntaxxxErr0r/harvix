1.00	Metal_prices	Metal prices	Metal prices (metal commodities) are only for a few metals quoted on exchanges. Only Aluminium Alloy, Aluminium, Copper, Lead, Nickel, Tin, Zinc and Nasaac (North American special Aluminium alloy) are exchange traded commodities. Other metals (like Bismuth, Selenium, Tellurium and many others) are traded on market demand and the buyers/sellers themselves set the price.
