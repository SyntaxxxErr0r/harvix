3.00	Scurvy-grass_Sorrel	Oxalis enneaphylla	Oxalis enneaphylla, the scurvy-grass sorrel, is a late spring- and summer-flowering, rhizomous, alpine perennial herbaceous plant native to the grasslands of South America. It is a small plant that grows to 7 cm (2.8 in) high and 10 cm (3.9 in) across. The flowers have an almond scent, and the greens are edible but have a sharp taste due to their high oxalic acid content. The name enneaphylla comes from the Greek εννεα , "nine" and φυλλον (phyllon), "leaf". The flowers are hermaphrodite and pollinated by Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Oxalis_enneaphylla.jpg/220px-Oxalis_enneaphylla.jpg
