55.3	Letterboxing	Letterboxing	Letterboxing is an outdoor hobby that combines elements of orienteering, art, and puzzle solving. Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly-accessible places (like parks) and distribute clues to finding the box in printed catalogs, on one of several web sites, or by word of mouth. Individual letterboxes usually contain a notebook and a rubber stamp. Finders make an imprint of the letterbox's stamp, either on their personal notebook or on a postcard, and leave an impression of their personal stamp on the letterbox's "visitors' book" or "logbook" â€” as proof of having found the box and letting other letterboxers know who has visited. Many letterboxers keep careful track of their "find count".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/WorldWideLetterBox016.png/220px-WorldWideLetterBox016.png
