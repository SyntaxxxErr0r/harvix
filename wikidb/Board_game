73.2	Board_game	Board game	A board game is a game that involves counters or pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or "board", according to a set of rules. Games can be based on pure strategy, chance (e.g. rolling dice) or a mixture of the two, and usually have a goal which a player aims to achieve. Early board games represented a battle between two armies, and most current board games are still based on defeating opposing players in terms of counters, winning position or accrual of points (often expressed as in-game currency).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/VA23Oct10_171.jpg/350px-VA23Oct10_171.jpg
