60.7	Water_crisis	Water crisis	Water crisis is a general term used to describe a situation where the available water within a region is less than the region's demand. The term has been used to describe the availability of potable water in a variety of regions by the United Nations and other world organizations. Others, for example the Food and Agriculture Organization, said in 2003 that there is no water crisis but steps must be taken to avoid one in the future. The major aspects of the water crisis are allegedly overall scarcity of usable water and water pollution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Madagascar_highland_plateau.jpg/240px-Madagascar_highland_plateau.jpg
