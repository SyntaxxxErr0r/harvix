51.6	Police_officer	Police officer	A police officer (also known as a policeman or policewoman, and constable in some forces, particularly in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations) is a warranted employee of a police force. In the United States, "officer" is the formal name of the lowest police rank; in many other countries "officer" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often "constable". Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/HH_Polizeihauptmeister_MZ.jpg/220px-HH_Polizeihauptmeister_MZ.jpg
