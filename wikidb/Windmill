55.7	Windmill	Windmill	A windmill is a machine which converts the energy of wind into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades. Originally windmills were developed for milling grain for food production. In the course of history the windmill was adapted to many other industrial uses. An important non-milling use is to pump groundwater up with windpumps, commonly known as windwheels. Windmills used for generating electricity are commonly known as wind turbines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/De_Kameel.jpg/220px-De_Kameel.jpg
