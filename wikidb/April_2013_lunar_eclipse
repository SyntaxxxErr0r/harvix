2.30	April_2013_lunar_eclipse	April 2013 lunar eclipse	A partial lunar eclipse will take place on April 25, 2013, the first of three lunar eclipses in 2013. Only a tiny sliver of the Moon will be covered by the Earth's umbral shadow at maximum eclipse, but the entire northern half of the moon will be darkened from being inside the penumbral shadow. This is the second shortest partial eclipse of the moon for the 21st century. On September 29, 2042, a partial eclipse of just 0.3% lasting just 12 minutes will be visible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Lunar_eclipse_chart_close-2013Apr25.png/320px-Lunar_eclipse_chart_close-2013Apr25.png
