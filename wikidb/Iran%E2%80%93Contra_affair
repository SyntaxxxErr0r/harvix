85.1	Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair	Iran–Contra affair	The Iran–Contra affair (Persian: ‎, Spanish: ), also referred to as Irangate, Contragate or Iran-Contra-Gate, was a political scandal in the United States that came to light in November 1986. During the Reagan administration, senior Reagan administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, the subject of an arms embargo. Some U.S. officials also hoped that the arms sales would secure the release of hostages and allow U.S. intelligence agencies to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Tow_atm.jpg/220px-Tow_atm.jpg
