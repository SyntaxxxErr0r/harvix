1.00	Noojee_railway_line	Noojee railway line	The Noojee railway line is a closed railway line in Victoria, Australia. Branching off from the Gippsland line at Warragul station, it was built to service the timber industry in the upper Latrobe River area, transporting timber as well as providing a general goods and passenger service to townships in the area. The final section of the line between Neerim South and Noojee traversed increasingly hilly terrain and featured a number of large timber trestle bridges. Extensively and repeatedly damaged by bushfires over the years, the line was closed in the 1950s and dismantled. The last remaining large trestle bridge on the line has been preserved and has become a popular local tourist attraction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/VR_map_1947_Noojee.jpg/300px-VR_map_1947_Noojee.jpg
