67.6	Neoplatonism	Neoplatonism	Neoplatonism (also called Neo-Platonism) (Greek: ), is the modern term for a school of religious and mystical philosophy that took shape in the 3rd century AD, based on the teachings of Plato and earlier Platonists, with its earliest contributor believed to be Plotinus, and his teacher Ammonius Saccas. Neoplatonism focused on the spiritual and cosmological aspects of Platonic thought, synthesizing Platonism with Egyptian and Jewish theology. However, Neoplatonists would have considered themselves simply Platonists, and the modern distinction is due to the perception that their philosophy contained sufficiently unique interpretations of Plato to make it substantially different from what Plato wrote and believed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Plotinos.jpg/100px-Plotinos.jpg
