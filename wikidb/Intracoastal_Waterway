Some lengths consist of natural inlets, salt-water rivers, bays, and sounds; others are artificial canals. It provides a navigable route along its length without many of the hazards of travel on the open sea.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Tug_%26_barges_on_Gulf_Intracoastal_Waterway.png/220px-Tug_%26_barges_on_Gulf_Intracoastal_Waterway.png
