61.1	Shale_gas	Shale gas	Shale gas is natural gas formed from being trapped within shale formations.

One analyst expects shale gas to supply as much as half the natural gas production in North America by 2020.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/EIA_World_Shale_Gas_Map.png/220px-EIA_World_Shale_Gas_Map.png
