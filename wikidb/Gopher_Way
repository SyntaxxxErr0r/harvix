The system is open during the normal business hours of the buildings it occupies, while some portions are open 24 hours a day. Access policies are posted at the entrances of connected buildings. It is one of three skyway/tunnel systems in the Twin Cities area. The other two occupy both downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Gopherway.jpg/150px-Gopherway.jpg
