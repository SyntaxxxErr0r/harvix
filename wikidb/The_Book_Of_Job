2.00	The_Book_Of_Job	Book of Job	The Book of Job (Hebrew: אִיוֹב‎ ʾ iyobh), commonly referred to simply as Job, is one of the books of the Hebrew Bible. It relates the story of Job, his trials at the hands of Satan, his discussions with friends on the origins and nature of his suffering, his challenge to God, and finally a response from God. The book is a didactic poem set in a prose frame. The over-riding and oft-asked question asked in the book of Job is, "Why do the righteous suffer?".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Aleppo_Codex_Joshua_1_1.jpg/170px-Aleppo_Codex_Joshua_1_1.jpg
