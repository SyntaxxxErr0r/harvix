2.10	Flagship_university	Flagship	A flagship is a vessel used by the commanding officer of a group of naval ships, reflecting the custom of its commander, characteristically a flag officer, flying a distinguishing flag. Used more loosely, it is the lead ship in a fleet of vessels, typically the first, largest, fastest, most heavily armed, or, in terms of media coverage, best known.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/HMS_Victory_1884.jpg/270px-HMS_Victory_1884.jpg
