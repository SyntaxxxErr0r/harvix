1.00	%E2%94%89	Box-drawing character	Box drawing characters, also known as line drawing characters, or pseudographics, are widely used in text user interfaces to draw various frames and boxes. In graphical user interfaces these characters are much less useful, because it is much simpler to draw lines and rectangles directly with graphical APIs; besides, box drawing characters work only with fixed-width fonts. They are still useful, however, for plaintext comments on websites.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/GNU_Midnight_Commander_4.1.36_Windows_Vista.png/280px-GNU_Midnight_Commander_4.1.36_Windows_Vista.png
