77.8	Monopsony	Monopsony	In economics, a monopsony is a market form in which only one buyer faces many sellers. It is an example of imperfect competition, similar to a monopoly, in which only one seller faces many buyers. As the only or majority purchaser of a good or service, the "monopsonist" may dictate terms to its suppliers in the same manner that a monopolist controls the market for its buyers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cb/Monopsony-static-partial-equilibrium.svg/300px-Monopsony-static-partial-equilibrium.svg.png
