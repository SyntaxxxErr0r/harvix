42.63	Western_Schism	Western Schism	The Western Schism or Papal Schism was a split within the Catholic Church from 1378 to 1417. Two men simultaneously claimed to be the true pope. Driven by politics rather than any theological disagreement, the schism was ended by the Council of Constance (1414–1418). The simultaneous claims to the papal chair of two different men hurt the reputation of the office. The Western Schism is sometimes called the Great Schism, although this term is also applied to the East–West Schism of 1054.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Western_schism_1378-1417.svg/350px-Western_schism_1378-1417.svg.png
