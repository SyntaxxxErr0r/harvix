2.00	Soixante-neuf	69 (sex position)	Sixty-nine or 69, also known by its French name soixante-neuf (69), is a group of sex positions in which two people align themselves so that each person's mouth is near the other's genitals, simultaneously performing oral sex. The participants are thus mutually inverted like the numerals 6 and 9 in the number 69, hence the name. This position can involve any combination of sexes. Although not displayed in any of the images, a 69 can also be performed with both partners on their sides, perhaps a more relaxed position.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Felicien_Rops_69.jpg/220px-Felicien_Rops_69.jpg
