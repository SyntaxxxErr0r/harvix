52.1	Biological_warfare	Biological warfare	Biological warfare (also known as germ warfare) is the use of biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi with intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war. Biological weapons (often termed "bio-weapons" or "bio-agents") are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses) that reproduce or replicate within their host victims. Entomological (insect) warfare is also considered a type of biological warfare.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/WMD_world_map.svg/175px-WMD_world_map.svg.png
