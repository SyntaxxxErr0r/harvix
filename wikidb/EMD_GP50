It is powered by a 16-cylinder EMD 645F3B diesel engine, which can produce between 3,500 and 3,600 horsepower. 278 examples of this locomotive were built by EMD between 1980 and 1985. A version of this locomotive called the GP50L was produced with an extended cab. The GP50 rides on the same frame as the EMD GP38, EMD GP38-2, EMD GP39, EMD GP39-2, EMD GP40 and EMD GP40-2, giving it an overall length of 59 feet 2 inches.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/BN_3157_IL_Eola.jpg/300px-BN_3157_IL_Eola.jpg
