The first human-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission on 13 September 1959. The United States's Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon on 20 July 1969. There have been six manned U.S. landings (between 1969 and 1972) and numerous unmanned landings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Apollo_11_first_step.jpg/300px-Apollo_11_first_step.jpg
