215.0	Hackerspace	Hackerspace	A hackerspace or hackspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace or creative space) is a location where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital or electronic art (but also in many other realms) can meet, socialise and/or collaborate. Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops, workshops and/or studios where hackers can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/RaumZeitLabor_Stairs.jpg/220px-RaumZeitLabor_Stairs.jpg
