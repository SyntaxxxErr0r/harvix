1.00	Uno_(motorcycle)	Uno (dicycle)	The Uno is an electric-powered vehicle that bears a resemblance to a motorized unicycle. Described in news reports as either a "one wheeled motorcycle" or "electric unicycle", it is more accurately a dicycle, created by placing two closely spaced unaxial drive wheels side-by-side at the centre-point of the vehicle. The Uno III is based on the original Uno with the addition of a third wheel that allows it to transform from a dicycle to a tricycle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Uno_motorcycle.jpg/220px-Uno_motorcycle.jpg
