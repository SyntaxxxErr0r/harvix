54.9	Vespasian	Vespasian	Vespasian (Latin: ; 17 November 9 â€“ 23 June 79), was Roman Emperor from AD 69 to AD 79. Vespasian was the founder of the Flavian dynasty, which ruled the Empire for a quarter century. Vespasian was descended from a family of equestrians, who rose into the senatorial rank under the Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Although he attained the standard succession of public offices, holding the consulship in AD 51, Vespasian became more reputed as a successful military commander, participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43, and subjugating Judaea during the Jewish rebellion of AD 66.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Vespasianus01_pushkin_edit.png/220px-Vespasianus01_pushkin_edit.png
