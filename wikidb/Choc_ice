2.11	Choc_ice	Choc ice	A Choc ice is a generic frozen dessert generally consisting of a block of rectangular ice cream, typically vanilla flavour. A common variant is purported to be rum and raisin flavour. A choc-ice is coated with a thin layer of chocolate or chocolate flavoured shell and does not have a stick. In many countries, there are numerous versions of this dessert produced under different brand names. One notable brand is Klondike. Choc ice sales are greatly increased during the summer months and on warmer days. The first one was sold in the United States in 1921. The concept was patented in the UK and sold on to major confectionary brands such as Walls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Choc_Ice.JPG/220px-Choc_Ice.JPG
