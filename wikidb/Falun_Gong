145.2	Falun_Gong	Falun Gong	Falun Gong (literally means "Law Wheel Practice", alternatively Falun Dafa) is a spiritual discipline first introduced in China in 1992 through public lectures by its founder, Li Hongzhi. It combines the practice of meditation and slow-moving qigong exercises with a moral philosophy. Falun Gong emphasises morality and the cultivation of virtue in its central tenets of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance (Chinese: ), and identifies as a qigong practice of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from Taoist traditions. Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to better health and, ultimately, spiritual enlightenment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Falun_Gong_Logo.svg/150px-Falun_Gong_Logo.svg.png
