The story is set in the distant future of Pournelle's CoDominium universe, and charts the first contact between humanity and an alien species. The title of the novel is a wordplay on Luke 6:41–42 and Matthew 7:3–5. The Mote in God's Eye was nominated for the Hugo, Nebula and Locus Awards in 1975. Robert A. Heinlein, who gave the authors extensive advice on the novel, blurbed the story as "possibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c0/The_Mote_In_God%27s_Eye_-_original_hardcover_edition.jpg
