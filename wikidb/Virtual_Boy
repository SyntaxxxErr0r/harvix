73.7	Virtual_Boy	Virtual Boy	The Virtual Boy Bācharu Bōi) was a video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was the first video game console that was supposed to be capable of displaying "true 3D graphics" out of the box. Whereas most video games use monocular cues to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, The Virtual Boy creates an illusion of depth through the effect known as parallax. In a manner similar to using a head-mounted display, the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Virtualboy_logo.svg/200px-Virtualboy_logo.svg.png
