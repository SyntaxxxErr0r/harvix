While a common practice in many nations, Niger sees as much as a third of its rural population travel for seasonal labor during the Sahelian nation's long dry season. Common patterns of seasonal travel have been built up over hundreds of years, and destinations and work vary by community and ethnic group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Niger_highway_overloaded_camion_2007.jpg/220px-Niger_highway_overloaded_camion_2007.jpg
