8.00	Exposion	Exposion	Exposion is the title of White Denim's first full length U.S. studio album. The debut record was first sold at live shows during their spring 2008 tour with Tapes 'n Tapes. The LP was distributed as an unlabeled CD-R in a paper wrapping, along with the title 11 Songs printed on the front. This "Tour LP" has finally been pressed onto 7" vinyls, and it is slated to be released November 3, 2008 on Transmission Entertainment. Exposion features many songs from previous releases, but most have been re-worked and re-recorded. The new album will be released much like the Let's Talk About EP (on vinyl and digital format only), with the band reporting that "CDs seem pretty worthless to us". The digital format of the album became available at the band's website on October 19, 2008, as announced at their October 20, 2008 show at Union Hall in Brooklyn, NY. It is also available as a Disc 2 to their 3rd album, Fits on most digital music services.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/WhiteDenim--Exposion.jpg/220px-WhiteDenim--Exposion.jpg
