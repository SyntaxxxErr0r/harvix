55.1	Homicide	Homicide	Homicide (Latin: , Latin: human being + Latin: to cut, kill) refers to the act of a human killing another human. Murder, for example, is a type of homicide. It can also describe a person who has committed such an act, though this use is rare in modern English. Homicide is not always a punishable act under the criminal law, and is different than a murder from such formal legal point of view.
