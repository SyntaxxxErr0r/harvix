1.01	Falco_eleonorae	Eleonora's Falcon	Eleonora's Falcon is a medium-sized falcon. It belongs to the hobby group, a rather close-knit number of similar falcons often considered a subgenus Hypotriorchis. The Sooty Falcon is sometimes considered its closest relative, but while they certainly belong to the same lineage, they do not seem to be close sister species. Eleonora's Falcon is named after Eleonor of Arborea, national heroine of Sardinia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Falco_eleonorae_NAUMANN.jpg/240px-Falco_eleonorae_NAUMANN.jpg
