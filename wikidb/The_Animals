119.0	The_Animals	The Animals	The Animals were an English rock band of the 1960s formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during the early part of the decade, and later relocated to London. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their number one signature song "The House of the Rising Sun" as well as by hits such as "We Gotta Get Out of This Place", "It's My Life", and "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. They were known in the U.S. as part of the British Invasion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Eric_Burdon_%26_the_Animals.jpg/220px-Eric_Burdon_%26_the_Animals.jpg
