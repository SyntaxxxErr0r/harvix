55.1	Mongoose	Mongoose	Mongooses (Herpestidae) are a family of 33 living species of small carnivorans from southern Eurasia and mainland Africa. Four additional species from Madagascar in the subfamily Galidiinae, which were previously classified in this family, are also referred to as "mongooses" or "mongoose-like". Genetic evidence indicates that the Galidiinae are more closely related to other Madagascar carnivorans in the family Eupleridae, which is the closest living group to the true mongooses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Dwarf_mongoose_Korkeasaari_zoo.jpg/220px-Dwarf_mongoose_Korkeasaari_zoo.jpg
