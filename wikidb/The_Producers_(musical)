62.3	The_Producers_(musical)	The Producers (musical)	The Producers is a musical adapted by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan from Brooks' 1968 film of the same name, with lyrics written by Brooks and music composed by Brooks and arranged by Glen Kelly and Doug Besterman. As in the film, the story concerns two theatrical producers who scheme to get rich by overselling interests in a Broadway flop. The humor of the show draws on ridiculous accents, caricatures of homosexuals and Nazis, and many show business in-jokes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Playbill.png/215px-Playbill.png
