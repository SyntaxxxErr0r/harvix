4.10	%C3%80_gogo	À gogo	À gogo, often anglicized as A Go-Go, is a French expression meaning "in abundance, galore". Alternate spellings vary widely, particularly concerning the placement and number of hyphens as well as the use of the "a" (see Go go). The term is often used in popular culture, especially in the field of music and dancing. Though earlier uses of the phrase were meant to lend a cosmopolitan feel to subjects, modern usage tends more toward an ironic, campy appeal.
