85.0	Professional_wrestling	Professional wrestling	Professional wrestling (often shortened pro wrestling, or simply wrestling) is a mode of spectacle, combining athletics and theatrical performance. It takes the form of events, held by touring companies, which mimic a title match combat sport. The unique form of sport portrayed is fundamentally based on classical and "catch" wrestling, with modern additions of striking attacks, strength-based holds and throws, and acrobatic maneuvers; much of these derive from the influence of various international martial arts. An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included to varying degrees.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Wrestling_-_Sikeston%2C_MO_1938_-_1.jpg/250px-Wrestling_-_Sikeston%2C_MO_1938_-_1.jpg
