2.00	Lancelot_Brown	Lancelot "Capability" Brown	Lancelot Brown (30 August 1716 â€“ 6 February 1783), more commonly known as Capability Brown, was an English landscape architect. He is remembered as "the last of the great English eighteenth-century artists to be accorded his due", and "England's greatest gardener". He designed over 170 parks, many of which still endure. His influence was so great that the contributions to the English garden made by his predecessors Charles Bridgeman and William Kent are often overlooked; even Kent's apologist Horace Walpole allowed that Kent had been followed by "a very able master".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Lancelot_%28%27Capability%27%29_Brown_by_Nathaniel_Dance%2C_%28later_Sir_Nathaniel_Dance-Holland%2C_Bt%29_cropped.jpg/220px-Lancelot_%28%27Capability%27%29_Brown_by_Nathaniel_Dance%2C_%28later_Sir_Nathaniel_Dance-Holland%2C_Bt%29_cropped.jpg
