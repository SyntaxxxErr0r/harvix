3.00	Cacafuego	Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de la Concepción (1570)	At the helm of his ship the Golden Hind, Sir Francis Drake had slipped into the Pacific Ocean via the strait of Magellan in 1578 without the knowledge of the Spanish authorities in South America. Privateers and pirates were common during the 16th century throughout the Spanish Main but were unheard of in the Pacific. Accordingly, the South American settlements were not prepared for the attack of "el Draque" (Spanish pronunciation of Sir Francis' last name), as Drake was to be known to his Spanish victims. During this trip, Drake pillaged El Callao (Peru's main port) and was able to gather information regarding the treasure ship Cagafuego, which was sailing towards Panama laden with silver and jewels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Capture_Of_Cacafuego.jpg/200px-Capture_Of_Cacafuego.jpg
