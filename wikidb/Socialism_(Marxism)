15.84	Socialism_(Marxism)	Socialism (Marxism)	In Marxist theory, socialism, lower-stage communism or the socialist mode of page, refers to a specific historical phase of economic development and its corresponding set of social relations that eventually supersede capitalism in the schema of historical materialism. Socialism is a mode of production where the criteria for economic production is use-value and direct production for use through conscious economic planning, where the law of value no longer directs economic activity, and thus monetary relations in the form of exchange-value, profit, interest and wage labor become irrelevant. Income would be distributed according to individual contribution. The social relations of socialism are characterized by the working-class effectively controlling the means of production and the means of their livelihood either through cooperative enterprises or public ownership and self management, so that the social surplus would accrue to the working class or society as a whole.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Marx_color2.jpg/110px-Marx_color2.jpg
