76.3	Conventional_wisdom	Conventional wisdom	Conventional wisdom (CW) is a term used to describe ideas or explanations that are generally accepted as true by the public or by experts in a field. Such ideas or explanations, though widely held, are unexamined. Unqualified societal discourse preserves the status quo. It codifies existing social norms, which promote some objective social good. It can also eschew an empirical outlook which is needed in many pursuits. The potential damage of radical change can be minimized. Rigor can be brought back and conflation avoided in any worthwhile subject.
