54.3	Queen_of_Sheba	Queen of Sheba	The Queen of Sheba was a monarch of the ancient kingdom of Sheba and is referred to in Habeshan history, the Bible, the Qur'an, Yoruba customary tradition, and Josephus. She is widely assumed to have been a queen regnant, although there is no historical proof of this; in fact, she may have been a queen consort. The location of her kingdom is believed to have been in Ethiopia and Yemen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Claude_Lorrain_008.jpg/300px-Claude_Lorrain_008.jpg
