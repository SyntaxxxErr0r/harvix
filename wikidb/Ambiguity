65.9	Ambiguity	Ambiguity	Ambiguity of information, in words, pictures, or other media, is the ability to express more than one interpretation. It is generally contrasted with vagueness, in that specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately apparent), whereas with information that is vague it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Alice_05a-1116x1492.jpg/250px-Alice_05a-1116x1492.jpg
