94.8	CUDA	CUDA	Compute Unified Device Architecture is a parallel computing architecture developed by Nvidia for graphics processing. CUDA is the computing engine in Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that is accessible to software developers through variants of industry standard programming languages. Programmers use 'C for CUDA' (C with Nvidia extensions and certain restrictions), compiled through a PathScale Open64 C compiler, to code algorithms for execution on the GPU. CUDA architecture shares a range of computational interfaces with two competitors: the Khronos Group's OpenCL and Microsoft's DirectCompute. Third party wrappers are also available for Python, Perl, Fortran, Java, Ruby, Lua, Haskell, MATLAB, IDL, and native support in Mathematica. CUDA programming in the web browser is freely available for individual non-commercial purposes in NCLab.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/CUDA_processing_flow_%28En%29.PNG/300px-CUDA_processing_flow_%28En%29.PNG
