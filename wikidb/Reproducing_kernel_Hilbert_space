6.22	Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space	Reproducing kernel Hilbert space	The Bergman kernel is defined for open sets D in Cn. Take the Hilbert H space of square-integrable functions, for the Lebesgue measure on D, that are holomorphic functions. The theory is non-trivial in such cases as there are such functions, which are not identically zero. Then H is a reproducing kernel space, with kernel function the Bergman kernel; this example, with n = 1, was introduced by Bergman in 1922.
