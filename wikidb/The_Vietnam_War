8.43	The_Vietnam_War	Vietnam War	The Vietnam WarA 3 was a Cold War-era military conflict that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955A 1 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. This war followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam, supported by its communist allies, and the government of South Vietnam, supported by the United States of America and other anti-communist countries. The Viet Cong (also known as the National Liberation Front, or NLF), a lightly armed South Vietnamese communist-controlled common front, largely fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region. The Vietnam People's Army (North Vietnamese Army) engaged in a more conventional war, at times committing large units into battle. U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Bruce_Crandall%27s_UH-1D.jpg/300px-Bruce_Crandall%27s_UH-1D.jpg
