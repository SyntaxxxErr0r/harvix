73.0	Option_(finance)	Option (finance)	In finance, an option is a derivative financial instrument that specifies a contract between two parties for a future transaction on an asset at a reference price (the strike). The buyer of the option gains the right, but not the obligation, to engage in that transaction, while the seller incurs the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction. The price of an option derives from the difference between the reference price and the value of the underlying asset (commonly a stock, a bond, a currency or a futures contract) plus a premium based on the time remaining until the expiration of the option. Other types of options exist, and options can in principle be created for any type of valuable asset.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Reserve-Bank-of-India.jpg/135px-Reserve-Bank-of-India.jpg
