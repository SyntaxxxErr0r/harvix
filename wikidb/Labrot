2.00	Labrot	Woodford Reserve	Woodford Reserve is a brand of premium small batch Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey produced by the Brown-Forman Corporation. It is distilled at the company's Woodford Reserve Distillery, and marketed under the former company name for the distillery, Labrot &amp; Graham. The distillery is located in Woodford County, in central Kentucky. Formerly known as Labrot &amp; Graham's Old Oscar Pepper Distillery, the distillery is approximately eight miles from the town of Versailles off U.S. Route 60, between Interstate 64 and Versailles. Each bottle is numbered with a batch number and bottle number. Woodford Reserve's alcohol content is 45.2% (90.4 Proof). No age statement is listed on the bottle. U.S. law requires any bourbon aged less than four years to have an age statement, so the Woodford Reserve bottlings must be at least four years old.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/Woodford_Reserve.jpg/250px-Woodford_Reserve.jpg
