152.7	Kimchi	Kimchi	Kimchi (Korean: ), also spelled gimchi, kimchee, or kim chee, is a traditional fermented Korean dish made of vegetables with a variety of seasonings. Kimchi was originally developed as a way to preserve the vitamins and minerals in vegetables over the long winter since the cold winters of Northern Korea and the mountainous areas meant that brining and pickling foods was the best way to achieve this. There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made with a main vegetable ingredient such as napa cabbage, radish, scallion or cucumber. It is the most common banchan, or side dish, in Korean cuisine. Kimchi is also a main ingredient for many popular Korean dishes such as kimchi stew (김치찌개; kimchi jjigae), kimchi soup (김칫국; kimchiguk), and kimchi fried rice (김치볶음밥; kimchi bokkeumbap).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Gimchi.jpg/220px-Gimchi.jpg
