42.58	Honour	Honour	Honour or honor (see spelling differences; from the Latin word honos, honoris) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Pante%C3%B3n_de_Hombres_Ilustres_%28Madrid%29_02a.jpg/200px-Pante%C3%B3n_de_Hombres_Ilustres_%28Madrid%29_02a.jpg
