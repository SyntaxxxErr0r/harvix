2.01	Selegeline	Selegiline	Selegiline is a drug used for the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease, depression and senile dementia. In normal clinical doses it is a selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitor, however in larger doses it loses its specificity and also inhibits MAO-A. Dietary restrictions are common for MAOI treatments, but special dietary restrictions for lower doses have been found to be unnecessary, and dietary restrictions appear to be unnecessary at standard doses when selegiline is taken as Emsam, the transdermal patch form, as no adverse events due to diet have ever been reported with Emsam. The drug was discovered by Jozsef Knoll et al. in Hungary. Selegiline belongs to a class of drugs called phenethylamines. Selegiline is a methamphetamine derivative with a propargyl group attached to the nitrogen atom.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Selegilin.svg/220px-Selegilin.svg.png
