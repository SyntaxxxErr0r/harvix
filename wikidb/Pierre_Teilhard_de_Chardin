Teilhard conceived the idea of the Omega Point and developed Vladimir Vernadsky's concept of Noosphere. Some of his ideas came into conflict with the Magisterium of the Catholic Church, and several of his books were censured.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Teilhard_de_Chardin%281%29.jpg/190px-Teilhard_de_Chardin%281%29.jpg
