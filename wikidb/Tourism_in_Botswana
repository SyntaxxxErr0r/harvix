Other attractions include the Okavango Delta region, which during the rainy season is a maze of waterways, islands, and lakes. The tourism industry also helped to diversify Botswana's economy from traditional sources such as diamonds and beef and created 23,000 jobs in 2005.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Giraffe_standing.jpg/250px-Giraffe_standing.jpg
