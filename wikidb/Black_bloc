89.1	Black_bloc	Black bloc	A black bloc is a tactic for protests and marches whereby individuals wear black clothing, scarves, ski masks, motorcycle helmets with padding, or other face-concealing items. The clothing is used to conceal marchers' identities, appear theoretically as one large unified mass, and promote solidarity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/March_on_Crystal_City%2C_black_bloc_near_World_Bank.jpg/350px-March_on_Crystal_City%2C_black_bloc_near_World_Bank.jpg
