In furtherance of that mission, the Museum instituted an annual Honor Award in 1986 to recognize individuals and organizations that have made important contributions to the U.S.'s building heritage. Recipients are selected from a wide variety of backgrounds to call attention to the many factors that determine the form and quality of the built world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Honor_Award_10_Civic_Innovators_group.jpg/220px-Honor_Award_10_Civic_Innovators_group.jpg
