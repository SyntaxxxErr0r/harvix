56.6	Bird_of_prey	Bird of prey	Birds of prey are birds that hunt for food primarily on the wing, using their keen senses, especially vision. They are defined as birds that primarily hunt vertebrates, including other birds. Their talons and beaks tend to be relatively large, powerful and adapted for tearing and/or piercing flesh. In most cases, the females are considerably larger than the males. The term "raptor" is derived from the Latin word rapere (meaning to seize or take by force) and may refer informally to all birds of prey, or specifically to the diurnal group. Because of their predatory lifestyle, often at the top of the food chain, they face distinct conservation concerns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Gyps_fulvus_1_Luc_Viatour.jpg/220px-Gyps_fulvus_1_Luc_Viatour.jpg
