56.7	Maastricht_Treaty	Maastricht Treaty	The Maastricht Treaty (formally, the Treaty on European Union or TEU) was signed on 7 February 1992 by the members of the European Community in Maastricht, Netherlands. On 9â€“10 December 1991, the same city hosted the European Council which drafted the treaty. Upon its entry into force on 1 November 1993 during the Delors Commission, it created the European Union and led to the creation of the single European currency, the euro. The Maastricht Treaty has been amended to a degree by later treaties. For details of the content of the treaty, as well as later amendments by the treaties of Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon, see the Treaties of the European Union article.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Eurozone.svg/100px-Eurozone.svg.png
