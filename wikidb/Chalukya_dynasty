8.70	Chalukya_dynasty	Chalukya dynasty	The Chalukya dynasty from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakesi II. After the death of Pulakesi II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Badami-chalukya-empire-map.svg/250px-Badami-chalukya-empire-map.svg.png
