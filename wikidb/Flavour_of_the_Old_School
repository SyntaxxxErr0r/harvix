2.20	Flavour_of_the_Old_School	Flavour of the Old School	'"Flavour of the Old School"' is a song by British soul singer Beverley Knight, released as her debut single. The track, which peaked at number fifty on the UK Singles Chart when it was released in March 1995, was accompanied by a low budget video that saw Knight in the recording studio singing directly into the camera. It was re-released however in October 1995, supported by a new video and strong support from urban radio. The song went on to become Knight's first top 40 single, peaking at number thirty-three in the official UK Singles Chart. The song later reappeared on the b-side of Knight's 1999 single "Made it Back".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/97/FlavouroftheOldSchool.JPG/220px-FlavouroftheOldSchool.JPG
