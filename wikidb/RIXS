1.00	RIXS	Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering	Inelastic X-ray Scattering is a fast developing experimental technique in which one scatters high energy, x-ray photons inelastically off matter. It is a photon-in/photon-out spectroscopy where one measures both the energy and momentum change of the scattered photon. The energy and momentum lost by the photon are transferred to intrinsic excitations of the material under study and thus RIXS provides information about those excitations. The RIXS process can also be described as a Resonant X-ray Raman or Resonant X-ray Emission process.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Direct_RIXS_process.jpg/300px-Direct_RIXS_process.jpg
