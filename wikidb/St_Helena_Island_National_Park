3.10	St_Helena_Island_National_Park	St Helena Island National Park	St Helena Island is an island in Queensland, Australia, 21 km east of Brisbane in Moreton Bay. Originally used as a prison, it is now a national park. Named Noogoon by the Australian Aborigines, it was renamed St Helena after an aboriginal named Napoleon was exiled there in 1826. The island park is visible from the mainland, particularly the suburbs of Wynnum, Manly and Lota. It has its own permanent water supply, a spring in the centre of the island. Many migratory birds use the island as a watering hole; it forms part of the Moreton Bay and Pumicestone Passage Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because it supports large numbers of migratory waders, or shorebirds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/St_Helena_Island_-_Butcher_Baker.jpg/288px-St_Helena_Island_-_Butcher_Baker.jpg
