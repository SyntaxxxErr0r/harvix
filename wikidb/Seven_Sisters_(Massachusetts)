3.00	Seven_Sisters_(Massachusetts)	Seven Sisters (Massachusetts)	The Seven Sisters, part of the Holyoke Range and located within the Pioneer Valley region of Massachusetts, are a series of basalt ridgeline knobs between Mount Holyoke and Mount Hitchcock (there are actually more than seven distinct peaks). The knobs offer scenic clifftop views interspersed with oak savanna woodlands. The highest "sister" has an elevation of 945 ft (288 m) and stands 800 ft (244 m) above the valley below. The terrain is very rugged; a continuous walk along the ridgeline includes an overall elevation change of 3,700 ft (1,128 m). The Seven Sisters are traversed by the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Cole_Thomas_The_Oxbow_%28The_Connecticut_River_near_Northampton_1836.jpg/120px-Cole_Thomas_The_Oxbow_%28The_Connecticut_River_near_Northampton_1836.jpg
