56.3	Persistent_organic_pollutant	Persistent organic pollutant	Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes. Because of this, they have been observed to persist in the environment, to be capable of long-range transport, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, biomagnify in food chains, and to have potential significant impacts on human health and the environment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Map_of_Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants.svg/275px-Map_of_Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants.svg.png
