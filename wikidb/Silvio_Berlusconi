150.1	Silvio_Berlusconi	Silvio Berlusconi	Berlusconi is the longest-serving post-war Prime Minister of Italy, and third longest-serving since Italy's unification, after Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Giolitti, holding three separate terms. Technically, he has been sworn in four times because after a cabinet reshuffle, as happened with Berlusconi in 2005, the new ministry is sworn in and subjected to a vote of confidence. He is the leader of the People of Freedom political movement, a centre-right party he founded in 2009. From November 2009 to November 2011, he was the most senior leader of the G8 countries. In 2011, Forbes magazine ranked him as the 118th richest man in the world with a net worth of US$6.2 billion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Silvio_Berlusconi_%282010%29.jpg/220px-Silvio_Berlusconi_%282010%29.jpg
