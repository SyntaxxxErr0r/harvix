119.1	Armenian_Genocide	Armenian Genocide	The Armenian Genocide , also known as the Armenian Holocaust, the Armenian Massacres and, by Armenians, as the Great Crime (, Armenian pronunciation: ) was the systematic killing of the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire during and just after World War I. It was implemented through wholesale massacres and deportations, with the deportations consisting of forced marches under conditions designed to lead to the death of the deportees. The total number of resulting Armenian deaths is generally held to have been between 1 million and 1.5 million. Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks, and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Marcharmenians.jpg/320px-Marcharmenians.jpg
