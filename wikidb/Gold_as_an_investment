66.8	Gold_as_an_investment	Gold as an investment	Of all the precious metals, gold is the most popular as an investment. Investors generally buy gold as a hedge or harbor against economic, political. or social fiat currency crises (including investment market declines, burgeoning national debt, currency failure, inflation, war and social unrest). The gold market is subject to speculation as are other markets, especially through the use of futures contracts and derivatives. The history of the gold standard, the role of gold reserves in central banking, gold's low correlation with other commodity prices, and its pricing in relation to fiat currencies during the Late-2000s financial crisis, suggest that gold behaves more like a currency than a commodity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/2006reserves_%28forex_and_gold%29.PNG/220px-2006reserves_%28forex_and_gold%29.PNG
