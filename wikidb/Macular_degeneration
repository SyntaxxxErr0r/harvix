137.4	Macular_degeneration	Macular degeneration	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a medical condition which usually affects older adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the macula) because of damage to the retina. It occurs in “dry” and “wet” forms. It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment in older adults (&gt;50 years). Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognize faces, although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/04/Intermediate_age_related_macular_degeneration.jpg/230px-Intermediate_age_related_macular_degeneration.jpg
