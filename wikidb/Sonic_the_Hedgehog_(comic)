The comic book series debuted in the United States as a 4 part mini-series (issues #0-3) published between November 1992 and February 1993. The ongoing series began in May 1993, nearly two years after the release of the first video game in 1991 for the Sega Genesis. Spin-off publications from the comic include a Knuckles the Echidna series starring the titular character, which ran for 32 issues; 15 48-page "Super Specials"; 8 single 48-page special issues; and 4 short three-issue miniseries, each starring a character from the series. On September 21, 2005, Archie Comics started a new series based on the animated series Sonic X. In February 2009, the Sonic X series was replaced by Sonic Universe, a direct spin-off of the parent comic, Sonic the Hedgehog.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/98/Sonic_cast.jpg/250px-Sonic_cast.jpg
