3.00	Variolite	Variolite	Variolites (Latin varius, "speckled, variegated") are a group of dark green basic igneous rocks that, especially on weathered surfaces, exhibit pale colored spots, or spherules, that give them a pockmarked appearance. In some conditions these spots weather out prominently; they are grey, pale green, violet or yellowish, while the matrix of the rock is usually dark green.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Sample_of_Variolite%2C_Olympic_Peninsula%2C_Washington_USA.jpg/220px-Sample_of_Variolite%2C_Olympic_Peninsula%2C_Washington_USA.jpg
