78.5	Teabagging	Tea bag (sexual act)	To tea bag is a slang term for the act of a man placing his scrotum in the mouth of a sexual partner or onto the face or head of another person. The practice resembles dipping a tea bag into a cup of tea when it is done in a repeated in-and-out motion. As a form of non-penetrative sex, it can be done for its own enjoyment or as foreplay.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Wiki-oral-scrotum.png/220px-Wiki-oral-scrotum.png
