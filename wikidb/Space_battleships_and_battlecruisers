2.00	Space_battleships_and_battlecruisers	Military spacecraft in fiction	Fictional capital military spacecraft (frequently called space battleships, space cruisers) are spacefaring warships most often found in science fiction, which play similar roles to contemporary warships, though real spacecraft are used for military purposes. They may fight slow-paced battles across vast distances with long range guided weapons, never attaining visual contact, or fast-paced, relatively close range combat with unguided weapons and combat maneuvering.
