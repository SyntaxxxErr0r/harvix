94.7	Medicaid	Medicaid	Medicaid is the United States health program for certain people and families with low incomes and resources. It is a means-tested program that is jointly funded by the state and federal governments, and is managed by the states. People served by Medicaid are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, including low-income adults, their children, and people with certain disabilities. Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify someone for Medicaid. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with limited income in the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/Centers_for_Medicare_and_Medicaid_Services_logo.png
