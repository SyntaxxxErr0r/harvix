2.00	Eustigmatophyte	Eustigmatophyte	Eustigmatophytes are a small group (7 genera; ~12 species) of eukaryotic algae that includes marine, freshwater and soil-living species. All eustigmatophytes are unicellular, with coccoid cells and polysaccharide cell walls. Eustigmatophytes contain one or more yellow-green chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll a and the accessory pigments violaxanthin and Î²-carotene. Eustigmatophyte zoids possess a single or pair of flagella, originating from the apex of the cell. Unlike other heterokontophytes, eustigmatophyte zoids do not have typical photoreceptive organelles (or eyespots); instead, an orange-red eyespot outside of a chloroplast is located at the anterior end of the zoid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/15_3klein2.jpg/220px-15_3klein2.jpg
