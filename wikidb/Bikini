77.4	Bikini	Bikini	The bikini is typically a women's two-piece swimsuit. One part of the attire covers the breasts and the other part covers the groin and part of or the entire buttocks, leaving an uncovered area between the two. Merriamâ€“Webster describes the bikini as "a woman's scanty two-piece bathing suit" or "a man's brief swimsuit". It is often worn in hot weather, while swimming or sunbathing. The shapes of both parts of a bikini resemble women's underwear, and the lower part can range from revealing thong or g-string to briefs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Bikini_Model_Jassi_3.jpg/175px-Bikini_Model_Jassi_3.jpg
