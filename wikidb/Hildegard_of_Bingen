82.3	Hildegard_of_Bingen	Hildegard of Bingen	Saint Hildegard of Bingen, O.S.B. (German: ; Latin: ) (1098 â€“ 17 September 1179), also known as Saint Hildegard, and Sibyl of the Rhine, was a German writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, Benedictine abbess, visionary, and polymath. Elected a magistra by her fellow nuns in 1136, she founded the monasteries of Rupertsberg in 1150 and Eibingen in 1165. One of her works as a composer, the Ordo Virtutum, is an early example of liturgical drama and arguably the oldest surviving morality play.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Hildegard.jpg/220px-Hildegard.jpg
