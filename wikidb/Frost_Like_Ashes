1.00	Frost_Like_Ashes	Frost Like Ashes	Frost Like Ashes is a Christian black metal band that formed in Kansas City, Missouri in 2001. The band has released two EP's and a full-length CD titled Tophet, and their songs have appeared on 2 compilations titled A Brutal Christmas and A Treasury of Sorrows. Previously signed to Psycho Acoustix Records and currently to Sullen Records, an imprint of Open Grave Records, their music combines elements of black metal, death metal and thrash metal with keyboards and virtuosic vocals notable for "switching between about 10 different extreme styles within a given song." Their lyrics have achieved attention for their harsh output, providing a Biblical point of view for the regular, cruel themes of black metal music. The band is also controversial for using the typical corpse paint style often associated with the black metal visuals.
