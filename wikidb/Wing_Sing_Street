A narrow street was famous for its egg market, dating back to early Chinese settlement on the Victoria City on the Hong Kong Island. The ladder of street filled the shops of all kinds of eggs. The market was erased from the map by Land Development Corporation for the re-development of the area bounded by Wing Lok Street, Man Wa Lane, Bonham Strand, Queen's Road Central and Wing Wo Street. The bounded area now erects Cosco Tower and Grand Millennium Plaza.
