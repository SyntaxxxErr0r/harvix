1.00	Lateral_tegmental_field	Tegmentum	The tegmentum (from Latin for "covering") is a general area within the brainstem. It is located between the ventricular system and distinctive basal or ventral structures at each level. It forms the floor of the midbrain whereas the tectum forms the ceiling. It is a multisynaptic network of neurons that is involved in many unconscious homeostatic and reflexive pathways.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Gray712.png/250px-Gray712.png
