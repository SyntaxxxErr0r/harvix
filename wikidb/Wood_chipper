4.02	Wood_chipper	Woodchipper	A tree chipper or wood chipper is a machine used for reducing wood (generally tree limbs or trunks) into smaller parts, such as wood chips or sawdust. They are often portable, being mounted on wheels on frames suitable for towing behind a truck or van. Power is generally provided by an internal combustion engine from 3 horsepower (2.2 kW) to 1,000 horsepower (750 kW). There are also high power chipper models mounted on trucks and powered by a separate engine. These models usually also have a hydraulic crane.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Europe_Chippers_1.jpg/220px-Europe_Chippers_1.jpg
