54.9	2010_United_States_Census	2010 United States Census	The Twenty-third United States Census, known as Census 2010, the 2010 Census, or the Census of 2010, is the current national census of the United States. National Census Day was April 1, 2010 and is the reference date used in enumerating (counting) individuals. Directors of the 2010 Census made an emphasis on getting an accurate count, an emphasis that included the hiring of 635,000 temporary enumerators. The population of the United States was counted as 308,745,538, a 9.7% increase from the 2000 Census. The state with the highest percentage rate of growth was Nevada, while the state with the largest population increase was Texas. Michigan was the only state to lose population (although Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, lost population as well), and the District of Columbia saw its first gain since the 1950s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Census_Bureau_seal.svg/120px-Census_Bureau_seal.svg.png
