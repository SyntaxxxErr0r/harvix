14.06	Education_in_Australia	Education in Australia	Education in Australia is primarily the responsibility of the states and territories. Each state or territory government provides funding and regulates the public and private schools within its governing area. The federal government helps fund the public universities, but is not involved in setting curriculum. Generally, education in Australia follows the three-tier model which includes primary education (primary schools), followed by secondary education (secondary schools/high schools) and tertiary education (universities and/or TAFE colleges).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/150px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png
