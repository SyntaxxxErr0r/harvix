18.81	Grey_Gardens_(musical)	Grey Gardens (musical)	Grey Gardens is an American musical with book by Doug Wright, music by Scott Frankel, and lyrics by Michael Korie, based on the 1975 documentary of the same title about the lives of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale ("Big Edie") and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale ("Little Edie") by Albert and David Maysles. The Beales were Jacqueline Kennedy's aunt and cousin, respectively. Set at Grey Gardens, the Bouviers' mansion in East Hampton, New York, the musical tracks the progression of their lives from their original status as rich and socially polished aristocrats to their eventual largely isolated existence in a home overrun by cats and cited for repeated health code violations. However, its more central purpose is to untangle the complicated dynamics of their dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a7/Grey_Gardens_%28musical_starring_M_L_Wilson%29_poster.jpg/200px-Grey_Gardens_%28musical_starring_M_L_Wilson%29_poster.jpg
