4.11	Sancho_III_of_Navarre	Sancho III of Navarre	Sancho III Garcés (c. 992 – 18 October 1035), called the Great (Spanish: , Basque: ), succeeded as a minor to the Kingdom of Navarre in 1004, and through conquest and political maneuvering increased his power, until at the time of his death in 1035 he controlled the majority of Christian Iberia, bearing the title of rex Hispaniarum. Having gone further than any of his predecessors in uniting the divided kingdoms of Iberia, his life's work was undone when he divided his domains shortly before his death to provide for each of his sons. The Kingdom of Navarre existed for almost six centuries after his death, but was never as powerful again.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lauda_Sepulcral_SanchoIII_El_Mayor_Navarra.jpg/220px-Lauda_Sepulcral_SanchoIII_El_Mayor_Navarra.jpg
