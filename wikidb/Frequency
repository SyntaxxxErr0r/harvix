116.7	Frequency	Frequency	Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency. The period is the duration of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its period (the interval between beats) is half a second.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/FrequencyAnimation.gif/120px-FrequencyAnimation.gif
