52.4	Home_insurance	Home insurance	In the United States, most home buyers borrow money in the form of a mortgage loan, and the mortgage lender always requires that the buyer purchase homeowner's insurance as a condition of the loan, in order to protect the bank if the home were to be destroyed. Anyone with an insurable interest in the property should be listed on the policy. In some cases the mortgagee will waive the need for the mortgagor to carry homeowner's insurance if the value of the land exceeds the amount of the mortgage balance. In a case like this even the total destruction of any buildings would not affect the ability of the lender to be able to foreclose and recover the full amount of the loan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/YscloskBrownroofBuckets.jpg/220px-YscloskBrownroofBuckets.jpg
