83.4	Tit_for_tat	Tit for tat	Tit for tat is an English saying meaning "equivalent retaliation". It is also a highly effective strategy in game theory for the iterated prisoner's dilemma. It was first introduced by Anatol Rapoport in Robert Axelrod's two tournaments, held around 1980. An agent using this strategy will initially cooperate, then respond in kind to an opponent's previous action. If the opponent previously was cooperative, the agent is cooperative. If not, the agent is not. This is similar to superrationality and reciprocal altruism in biology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Handshake_%28Workshop_Cologne_%2706%29.jpeg/220px-Handshake_%28Workshop_Cologne_%2706%29.jpeg
