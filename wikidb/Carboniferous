63.1	Carboniferous	Carboniferous	The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that extends from the end of the Devonian Period, about 359.2 ± 2.5 Mya (million years ago), to the beginning of the Permian Period, about 299.0 ± 0.8 Mya . The name 'Carboniferous', which means "coal-bearing" and derives from the Latin words carbo (coal) and ferre (to carry), was coined by geologists, William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during this time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/LateCarboniferousGlobal.jpg/240px-LateCarboniferousGlobal.jpg
