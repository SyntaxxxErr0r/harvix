57.7	Humpback_Whale	Humpback whale	The humpback whale is a species of baleen whale. One of the larger rorqual species, adults range in length from 12–16 metres (39–52 ft) and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms (79,000 lb). The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with unusually long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is an acrobatic animal, often breaching and slapping the water. Males produce a complex song, which lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and is repeated for hours at a time. The purpose of the song is not yet clear, although it appears to have a role in mating.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Humpback_Whale_underwater_shot.jpg/220px-Humpback_Whale_underwater_shot.jpg
