1.00	Ouvrage_Bois-du-Four	Ouvrage Bois-du-Four	Ouvrage Bois-du-Four is a lesser work in the Fortified Sector of the Crusnes of the Maginot Line. The ouvrage consists of a single large combat block without an underground gallery system, and is located between petit ouvrage Mauvais-Bois and gros ouvrage Br√©hain, facing Luxembourg. A planned expansion, never carried out, was intended to enlarge Bois-du-Four into a fully equipped gros ouvrage. Bois-du-Four saw little action in either the Battle of France in 1940 or the Lorraine Campaign of 1944. It is preserved by the community of Villers-la-Montagne and may be visited.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Bois_du_Four.jpg/300px-Bois_du_Four.jpg
