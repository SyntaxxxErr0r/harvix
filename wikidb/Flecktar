1.00	Flecktar	Flecktarn	Flecktarn is a 3-, 4-, 5- or 6-colour disruptive camouflage pattern, the most common being the five colour pattern, consisting of dark green, light green, black, red brown and green brown or tan depending on the manufacturer. The use of spots creates a "dithering" effect, which eliminates hard boundaries between the different colours in much the same way the squares in the newest digital camouflage patterns do. The pattern is designed for use in temperate woodland terrain. It has been adapted as desert camouflage by varying the colours.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Flecktarn.jpg/220px-Flecktarn.jpg
