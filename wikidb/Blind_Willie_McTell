55.3	Blind_Willie_McTell	Blind Willie McTell	Blind Willie McTell (born William Samuel McTier May 5, 1898 â€“ August 19, 1959), was an influential Piedmont and ragtime blues singer and guitarist. He played with a fluid, syncopated fingerstyle guitar technique, common among many exponents of Piedmont blues, although, unlike his contemporaries, he came to exclusively use twelve-string guitars. McTell was also an adept slide guitarist, unusual among ragtime bluesmen. His vocal style, a smooth and often laid-back tenor, differed greatly from many of the harsher voice types employed by Delta bluesmen, such as Charlie Patton. McTell embodied a variety of musical styles, including blues, ragtime, religious music, and hokum.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Blind_Willie_McTell_LOC.jpg/220px-Blind_Willie_McTell_LOC.jpg
