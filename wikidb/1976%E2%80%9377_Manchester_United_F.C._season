They finished the season sixth in the league and won the FA Cup to end a nine-year spell without a major trophy. Despite this success, this was to be their last season under the management of Tommy Docherty, who had been at the helm for four-and-a-half years and revived United following several years of decline. During the close season, he was dismissed by the club after revealing his love affair with the wife of the club's physiotherapist.
