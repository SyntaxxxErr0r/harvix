12.41	Libyan_opposition	History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi	The history of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi spanned a period of over four decades from 1969 to 2011. Gaddafi became the de facto leader of the country on 1 September 1969 after leading a group of young Libyan military officers against King Idris I in a bloodless coup d'Ã©tat. After the king had fled the country, the Libyan Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) headed by Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and the old constitution and proclaimed the new Libyan Arab Republic, with the motto "freedom, socialism, and unity".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Leptis_Magna_Theatre.jpg/150px-Leptis_Magna_Theatre.jpg
