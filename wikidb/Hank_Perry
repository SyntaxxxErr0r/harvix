Hank "Socks" Perry played in 13 games, 7 as the backup center fielder to Ty Cobb, and the rest as a pinch-hitter. Perry had a .167 career batting average, not good enough to compete for playing time in center field with Cobb. Perry played with the Providence Grays in 1910 and earned the title Independent League Batting Champ for that year. In 1911 he played with the Sacramento Solons of the West Coast League, who traded him to the Detroit Tigers. Perry died in 1956 at age 79 in Pontiac, Michigan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/HankPerry.jpg/200px-HankPerry.jpg
