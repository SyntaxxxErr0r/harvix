53.6	Manual_transmission	Manual transmission	A manual transmission, also known as a manual gearbox or standard transmission (informally, a manual; standard, straight shift; stick (shift), (US); or straight drive) is a type of transmission used in motor vehicle applications. It generally uses a driver-operated clutch, typically operated by a foot pedal (automobile) or hand lever (motorcycle), for regulating torque transfer from the internal combustion engine to the transmission, and a gear stick, either operated by foot (as on a motorcycle) or by hand (as in an automobile).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Shift_stick.jpg/220px-Shift_stick.jpg
