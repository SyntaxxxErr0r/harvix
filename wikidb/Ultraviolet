207.0	Ultraviolet	Ultraviolet	Ultraviolet light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light, but longer than X-rays, in the range 10 nm to 400 nm, and energies from 3 eV to 124 eV. It is named because the spectrum consists of electromagnetic waves with frequencies higher than those that humans identify as the colour violet. These frequencies are invisible to humans, but visible to a number of insects and birds. They are also indirectly visible, by causing fluorescent materials to glow with visible light.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Blue_sun.jpg/220px-Blue_sun.jpg
