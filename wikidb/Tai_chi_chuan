133.9	Tai_chi_chuan	T'ai chi ch'uan	T'ai chi ch'uan (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: tàijíquán; Wade–Giles: t'ai4 chi2 ch'üan2; literally "Supreme Ultimate Fist"), often shortened to T'ai chi or Tai chi in the West, is a type of internal Chinese martial art practiced for both its defense training and its health benefits. It is also typically practiced for a variety of other personal reasons: its hard and soft martial art technique, demonstration competitions, and longevity. As a consequence, a multitude of training forms exist, both traditional and modern, which correspond to those aims. Some of t'ai chi ch'uan's training forms are especially known for being practiced at what most people categorize as slow movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Yang-single.jpg/200px-Yang-single.jpg
