73.1	Honorary_degree	Honorary degree	An honorary degree or a degree honoris causa (Latin: "for the sake of the honor") is an academic degree for which a university (or other degree-awarding institution) has waived the usual requirements, such as matriculation, residence, study, and the passing of examinations. The degree is typically a doctorate or, less commonly, a master's degree, and may be awarded to someone who has no prior connection with the academic institution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Ezra_Stiles_George_Washington_Honorary_Degree.jpg/200px-Ezra_Stiles_George_Washington_Honorary_Degree.jpg
