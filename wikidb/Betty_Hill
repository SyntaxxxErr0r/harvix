7.10	Betty_Hill	Betty and Barney Hill abduction	In 1968, Marjorie Fish of Oak Harbor, Ohio read Fuller's Interrupted Journey. She was an elementary school teacher and amateur astronomer. Intrigued by the "star map", Fish wondered if it might be "deciphered" to determine which star system the UFO came from. Assuming that one of the fifteen stars on the map must represent the Earth's Sun, Fish constructed a three-dimensional model of nearby Sun-like stars using thread and beads, basing stellar distances on those published in the 1969 Gliese Star Catalogue. Studying thousands of vantage points over several years, the only one that seemed to match the Hill map was from the viewpoint of the double star system of Zeta Reticuli. Therefore she concluded that the UFO might have come from a planet orbiting Zeta Reticuli. As a result of Fish's hypothesis, some have dubbed the Hills' account The Zeta Reticuli Incident.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Zeta_reticuli.png/350px-Zeta_reticuli.png
