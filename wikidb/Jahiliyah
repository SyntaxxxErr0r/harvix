1.00	Jahiliyah	Jahiliyyah	Jahiliyyah (Arabic: â€Ž / "ignorance") is an Islamic concept of "ignorance of divine guidance" or "the state of ignorance of the guidance from God" or "Days of Ignorance" referring to the condition in which Arabs found themselves in pre-Islamic Arabia, i.e. prior to the revelation of the Qur'an to Muhammad. The root of the term jahiliyyah is the I-form verb yajhalu "to be ignorant or stupid, to act stupidly". By extension, it has come to refer to the state of anyone not following Islam and the Qur'an.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Allah-eser-green.png/180px-Allah-eser-green.png
