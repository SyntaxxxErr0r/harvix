The date is also, simultaneously, that on which the current reigning Canadian sovereign's official birthday is recognized. It is sometimes informally considered as marking the beginning of the summer season in Canada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Victoria_%C3%A9difice_f%C3%A9d%C3%A9ral_canada.jpg/225px-Victoria_%C3%A9difice_f%C3%A9d%C3%A9ral_canada.jpg
