1.00	Anarchism_in_Sweden	Anarchism in Sweden	Anarchism was reported to have been extant in Sweden by Mikhail Bakunin as early as 1866. As with the movements in Germany and the Netherlands, Swedish anarchism had a strong syndicalist tendency. One of the earliest Swedish anarchists of note was the artist Ivan Aguéli who in 1884 was arrested and sentenced in the "Trial of the thirty" in Paris. Also prominent were Anton Nilson, Leon Larsson, Axel Holmström, Albert Jensen, and Hinke Bergegren. Bergegren edited and published nine issues of the weekly periodical Under röd flagg, from March to June 1891. The magazine, which had an anarchist communist editorial bent, featured excerpts from the writings of prominent European anarchist intellectuals Peter Kropotkin, Leo Tolstoy, and Élisée Reclus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Anarchy-symbol.svg/125px-Anarchy-symbol.svg.png
