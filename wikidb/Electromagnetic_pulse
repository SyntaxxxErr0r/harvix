100.8	Electromagnetic_pulse	Electromagnetic pulse	An electromagnetic pulse (sometimes abbreviated EMP) is a burst of electromagnetic radiation. The abrupt pulse of electromagnetic radiation usually results from certain types of high energy explosions, especially a nuclear explosion, or from a suddenly fluctuating magnetic field. The resulting rapidly-changing electric fields and magnetic fields may couple with electrical/electronic systems to produce damaging current and voltage surges.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/EMP_mechanism.GIF/333px-EMP_mechanism.GIF
