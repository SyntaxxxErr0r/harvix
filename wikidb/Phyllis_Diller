52.3	Phyllis_Diller	Phyllis Diller	Phyllis Diller (born Phyllis Ada Driver; July 17, 1917) is an American actress and comedian. She created a stage persona of a wild-haired, eccentrically dressed housewife who makes self-deprecating jokes about her age and attractiveness (or supposed lack thereof), her terrible cooking, and about a husband named "Fang" while pretending to smoke from a long cigarette holder. Diller's signature is her unusual laugh.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Phyllis_diller_2-25-2007.jpg/220px-Phyllis_diller_2-25-2007.jpg
