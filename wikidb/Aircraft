108.2	Aircraft	Aircraft	An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air, or, in general, the atmosphere of a planet. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Qantas_a380_vh-oqa_takeoff_heathrow_arp.jpg/300px-Qantas_a380_vh-oqa_takeoff_heathrow_arp.jpg
