1.00	Sheila_Fell	Sheila Fell	In December 1979, Hunter Davies began his article for the Sunday Times: “Sheila Fell lives at the top of a long flight of stairs in Chelsea.” He ended it with Fell's own words. “I don’t think of myself as a woman artist. Artists are either good or bad. I also intend to live until 104. I’ve promised myself I will. It’s what keeps me going when I worry if I’ll ever have time to do all the paintings in my head.” However, by the time the article appeared she was already dead. The inquest into her death reported that she died of alcohol poisoning. She was 48 years of age.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Sheila_Fell_Memorial%2C_Aspatria.JPG/220px-Sheila_Fell_Memorial%2C_Aspatria.JPG
