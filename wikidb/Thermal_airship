3.01	Thermal_airship	Thermal airship	A thermal airship is an airship that generates its lift via the difference in density due to a temperature differential between the gas inside its envelope and the ambient air. (This is in contrast to using a gas that is lighter than air at ambient temperature, such as helium.) Currently all thermal airships use hot air, as used in a hot air balloon, as their lifting gas. However, an airship that uses steam would also qualify as a thermal airship.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Heissluft-luftschiff_2011-1.jpg/250px-Heissluft-luftschiff_2011-1.jpg
