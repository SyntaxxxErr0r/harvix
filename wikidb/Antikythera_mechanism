It was recovered in 1900–1901 from the Antikythera wreck. Its significance and complexity were not understood until decades later. The construction has been dated to the early 1st century BC. Technological artifacts of similar complexity and workmanship did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks were built in Europe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/NAMA_Machine_d%27Anticyth%C3%A8re_1.jpg/280px-NAMA_Machine_d%27Anticyth%C3%A8re_1.jpg
