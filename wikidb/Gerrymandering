206.5	Gerrymandering	Gerrymandering	In the process of setting electoral districts, gerrymandering is a practice that attempts to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating geographic boundaries to create partisan or incumbent-protected districts. The resulting district is known as a gerrymander ( ); however, that word can also refer to the process.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/The_Gerry-Mander_Edit.png/200px-The_Gerry-Mander_Edit.png
