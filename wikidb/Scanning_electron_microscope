108.9	Scanning_electron_microscope	Scanning electron microscope	A scanning electron microscope is a type of electron microscope that images a sample by scanning it with a beam of electrons in a raster scan pattern. The electrons interact with the atoms that make up the sample producing signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography, composition, and other properties such as electrical conductivity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Misc_pollen.jpg/220px-Misc_pollen.jpg
