2.00	Hirak_Rajar_Deshe	Hirak Rajar Deshe	Hirak Rajar Deshe (Bengali: Hirok Rajar Deshe, lit. "in the land of the Diamond King". English title: Kingdom of Diamonds) is the second film of the Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne series directed by Satyajit Ray. A unique aspect of the film is that most of the dialogues exchanged by the protagonists of the film are rhyming. The only person who did not speak in rhyme, was the teacher, symbolizing that though the thoughts of everybody else is bound, the teacher was a free-thinker. The film was followed by the third film of the series directed by Satyajit Ray's son, Sandip Ray.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/87/Dvd_hirak_rajar_deshe.jpg/220px-Dvd_hirak_rajar_deshe.jpg
