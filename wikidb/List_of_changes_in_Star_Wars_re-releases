The commercial success of Star Wars gave George Lucas the opportunity to alter the original films of the trilogy: Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Many changes were motivated by Lucas's stated desire to make the original films closer to his vision for them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Star_Wars_Logo.svg/300px-Star_Wars_Logo.svg.png
