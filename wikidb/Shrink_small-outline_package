1.10	Shrink_small-outline_package	Small-outline integrated circuit	A small-outline integrated circuit is a surface-mounted integrated circuit (IC) package which occupies an area about 30â€“50% less than an equivalent DIP, with a typical thickness that is 70% less. They are generally available in the same pinouts as their counterpart DIP ICs. The convention for naming the package is SOIC or sometimes just SO followed by the number of pins. For example, a 14-pin 4011 would be housed in an SOIC-14 or SO-14 package.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/ON_MC33079_SOIC.jpg/160px-ON_MC33079_SOIC.jpg
