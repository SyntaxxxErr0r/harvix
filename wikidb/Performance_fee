8.01	Performance_fee	Performance fee	A performance fee is a fee that an investment fund may be charged by the investment manager that manages its assets, calculated by reference to the increase in the fund's net asset value (or "NAV"), which represents the value of the fund's investments. Performance fees are widely used by the investment managers of hedge funds, which typically charge a performance fee of 20% of the increase in the NAV of the fund.
