4.20	HL-20	HL-20 Personnel Launch System	The HL-20 Personnel Launch System was a circa 1990 NASA spaceplane concept for manned orbital missions studied by NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. HL-20 was envisaged as a lifting body re-entry vehicle based on the Soviet BOR-4 spaceplane design featuring low operational costs, improved flight safety, and a possibility of landing on conventional runways. No flight hardware was ever built.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/HL20_mockup.jpeg/250px-HL20_mockup.jpeg
