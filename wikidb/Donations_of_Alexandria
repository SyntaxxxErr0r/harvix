12.01	Donations_of_Alexandria	Donations of Alexandria	The Donations of Alexandria (Autumn 34 BC) were a religio-political (theopolitical) statement by Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony in which they distributed lands held by Rome and Parthia amongst Cleopatra's children, and granted them many titles, especially for Caesarion, son of Julius Caesar. The Donations caused a fatal breach in Antony's relations with Rome and were amongst the causes of the Final War of the Roman Republic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Donations_of_Alexandria_34BC.gif/280px-Donations_of_Alexandria_34BC.gif
