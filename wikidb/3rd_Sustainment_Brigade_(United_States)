2.10	3rd_Sustainment_Brigade_(United_States)	3rd Sustainment Brigade (United States)	The 3rd Sustainment Brigade is a sustainment brigade of the United States Army headquartered at Fort Stewart, Georgia. The 3rd Sustainment Brigade is responsible for providing logistical support to the 3rd Infantry Division, however the modular nature of the brigade means that it takes on other roles while deployed. Personnel serving under this brigade wear the Shoulder Sleeve Insignia exclusive to this brigade, rather than the insignia designated for the 3rd Infantry Division.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/3rd_Sustainment_Brigade.jpg/160px-3rd_Sustainment_Brigade.jpg
