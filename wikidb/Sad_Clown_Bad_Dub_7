1.00	Sad_Clown_Bad_Dub_7	Random Vol. 3/Sad Clown Bad Dub 7	"Random Vol. 3/Sad Clown Bad Dub 7" is a two CD package that consists of a volume of Mr. Dibbs' "Random" series and a volume of Atmosphere's "Sad Clown" series. Disc one is a compilation of both live and studio recordings involving Mr. Dibbs' DJ and production work. Disc two consists of Atmosphere rarities as mixed by Mr. Dibbs. Due to the nature of mix CDs, many of the 32 tracks clock in at under two minutes, but this disc is notable as it contains the only full run of "God's Bathroom Floor" on CD, which until recently has been a frequent Atmosphere concert closer.
