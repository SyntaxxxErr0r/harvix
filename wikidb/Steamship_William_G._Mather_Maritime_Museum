Mather is a retired Great Lakes bulk freighter now restored as a museum ship in Cleveland, Ohio, one of four in the Great Lakes region. She transported cargo such as ore, coal, stone, and grain to ports throughout the Great Lakes, and was nicknamed "The Ship That Built Cleveland" because Cleveland's steel mills were a frequent destination.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/SteamshipWilliamGMather.jpg/300px-SteamshipWilliamGMather.jpg
