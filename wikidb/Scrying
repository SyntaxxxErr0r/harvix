35.38	Scrying	Scrying	Scrying (also called seeing or peeping) is a magic practice that involves seeing things psychically in a medium, usually for purposes of obtaining spiritual visions and less often for purposes of divination or fortune-telling. The most common media used are reflective, translucent, or luminescent substances such as crystals, stones, glass, mirrors, water, fire, or smoke. Scrying has been used in many cultures as a means of divining the past, present, or future. Depending on the culture and practice, the visions that come when one stares into the media are thought to come from God, spirits, the psychic mind, the devil, or the subconscious.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/John_William_Waterhouse_-_The_Crystal_Ball.JPG/200px-John_William_Waterhouse_-_The_Crystal_Ball.JPG
