10.20	Are_you_being_served	Are You Being Served?	Are You Being Served? is a British sitcom broadcast from 1972 to 1985. It was set in the ladies' and gentlemen's clothing departments of Grace Brothers, a large, fictional London department store. It was written mainly by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft, with contributions by Michael Knowles and John Chapman. The idea for the show came from Lloyd's brief period in the early 1950s working at Simpsons of Piccadilly, a clothing store which traded for over 60 years until 1999.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/27/Are_You_Being_Served_pilot_title_card.png/275px-Are_You_Being_Served_pilot_title_card.png
