12.73	Ghost_station	Ghost station	Ghost stations is the usual English translation for the German word Geisterbahnh√∂fe. This term was used to describe certain stations on Berlin's U-Bahn and S-Bahn metro networks that were closed during the period of Berlin's division during the Cold War. Since then, the term has come to be used to describe any disused station on an underground railway line, especially those used by passing passenger trains.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Subway-Saint-Martin-03.jpg/300px-Subway-Saint-Martin-03.jpg
