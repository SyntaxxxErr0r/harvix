528.8	Economics	Economics	Economics is the social science that analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term economics comes from the Ancient Greek (, "management of a household, administration") from (, "house") + (, "custom" or "law"), hence "rules of the house(hold)". Political economy was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the latter 19th century suggested 'economics' as a shorter term for 'economic science' that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar in form to 'mathematics', 'ethics', and so forth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png
