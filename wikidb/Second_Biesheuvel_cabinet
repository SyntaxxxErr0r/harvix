1.00	Second_Biesheuvel_cabinet	Second Biesheuvel cabinet	The second Biesheuvel cabinet (9 August 1972 - 11 May 1973) was a Dutch rump cabinet with ministers from ARP, KVP, CHU (all confessional parties), and VVD (conservative liberal). It was the continuation of Biesheuvel I, which had become a 'caretaker' cabinet when the social-democratic DS70 removed itself from the coalition in June 1972. Elections were held later that year. Because the following negotiations for forming the next cabinet took rather long, the cabinet took further reaching decisions than a caretaker cabinet is usually supposed to do.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands_-_02.svg/150px-Coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands_-_02.svg.png
