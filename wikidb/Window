76.7	Window	Window	A window is a transparent or translucent opening in a wall or door that allows the passage of light and, if not closed or sealed, air and sound. Windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material like float glass. Windows are held in place by frames, which prevent them from collapsing in. Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/OldShipWindows.jpg/200px-OldShipWindows.jpg
