2.00	Glucometers	Glucose meter	A glucose meter (or glucometer) is a medical device for determining the approximate concentration of glucose in the blood. It is a key element of home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) by people with diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. A small drop of blood, obtained by pricking the skin with a lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. The meter then displays the level in mg/dl or mmol/l.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Glucose_meters.jpg/300px-Glucose_meters.jpg
