The skate contained a pivoting action using a rubber cushion, and this allowed the skater to skate a curve just by leaning to one side. It was a huge success, so much so that the first public skating rink was opened in 1866 in Newport, Rhode Island with the support of Plimpton. The design of the quad skate allowed easier turns and maneuverability. The quad skate came to dominate the industry for more than a century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/1908-PatinsRoulettes.jpg/200px-1908-PatinsRoulettes.jpg
