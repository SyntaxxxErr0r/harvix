Its goal is to raise awareness to the role that architecture, engineering, urban planning and construction have in achieving a sustainable built future. The organization encourages and rewards sustainable responses to the technological, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural issues affecting building and construction. The two main initiatives of the foundation are the Holcim Forums (a series of academic symposia) and the Holcim Awards (a USD 2 million competition for sustainable construction projects and visions).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/Holcim_foundation_4color.png/220px-Holcim_foundation_4color.png
