60.7	Essential_fatty_acid	Essential fatty acid	Essential fatty acids, or EFAs, are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them. The term "essential fatty acid" refers to fatty acids required for biological processes, and not those that only act as fuel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Fatty_acid_numbering.png/500px-Fatty_acid_numbering.png
