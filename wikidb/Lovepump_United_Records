The label is currently based in New York City. Friedman and Singerman were the only members of a duo Glitter Pals whose EP was Lovepump's first release; the band has since disbanded. Singerman is also the vocalist for Philadelphia based, "cybergrind" band Genghis Tron whose "Cloak of Love" EP was the second Lovepump release. Lovepump first gained attention in indie music circles by releasing the debut album by the much buzzed about Montreal based noise rock band AIDS Wolf in January of 2006.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/Lpulogo.jpg/150px-Lpulogo.jpg
