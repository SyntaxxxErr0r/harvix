138.7	Open_content	Open content	As with the terms "open source" and "free software", some open content materials can also be described as "free content". However, free content has preserved the requirement (present in both open source and free software) that licenses allow commercial use and adaptation. For similar reasons, the Free Software Foundation describes the Open Content License as a non-free documentation license and the Copyfree Initiative has rejected it for certification as a copyfree license.
