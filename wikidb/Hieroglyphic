23.01	Hieroglyphic	Hieroglyph	A hieroglyph (Greek for "sacred carving") is a character of the ancient Egyptian writing system. Partially pictographic logographic scripts reminiscent of ancient Egyptian are also sometimes called "hieroglyphs". In Neoplatonism, especially of the Renaissance, a hieroglyph was an artistic representation of an esoteric idea, which actual Egyptian hieroglyphs seemed to the Neoplatonists to be. The word hieroglyphics () may refer to writings in a hieroglyphic system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Egypt_Hieroglyphe4.jpg/220px-Egypt_Hieroglyphe4.jpg
