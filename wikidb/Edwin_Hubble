195.2	Edwin_Hubble	Edwin Hubble	Edwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889 – September 28, 1953) was an American astronomer who profoundly changed the understanding of the universe by confirming the existence of galaxies other than the Milky Way. He also considered the idea that the loss in frequency—the redshift—observed in the spectra of light from other galaxies increased in proportion to a particular galaxy's distance from Earth. This relationship became known as Hubble's law.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e5/Edwin_Hubble_with_pipe.jpg/220px-Edwin_Hubble_with_pipe.jpg
