54.1	Foley_artist	Foley artist	Foley is the reproduction of everyday sounds for use in filmmaking. These reproduced sounds can be anything from the swishing of clothing and footsteps to squeaky doors and breaking glass. The best foley art is so well integrated into a film that it goes unnoticed by the audience. It helps to create a sense of reality within a scene. Without these crucial background noises, movies feel unnaturally quiet and uncomfortable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Foley_Room_at_the_Sound_Design_Campus.jpg/250px-Foley_Room_at_the_Sound_Design_Campus.jpg
