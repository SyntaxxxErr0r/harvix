57.1	Chicago-style_pizza	Chicago-style pizza	Chicago-style pizza is a deep-dish pizza style developed in Chicago. Chicago-style pizza has a buttery crust up to three inches tall at the edge, slightly higher than the ingredients, which include large amounts of cheese and chunky tomato sauce, acting as a large bowl. The term also refers to "stuffed" pizza, another Chicago style. Both styles of pizza are usually eaten with a knife and fork. While in Chicago most pizzerias serve thin-crust pizza , generally in a style characteristic to the city, the term Chicago-style pizza is used to describe this deep-dish style of pizza.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Eq_it-na_pizza-margherita_sep2005_sml.jpg/100px-Eq_it-na_pizza-margherita_sep2005_sml.jpg
