1.10	The_Ico_%26_Shadow_of_the_Colossus_Collection	The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection	The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection (known in PAL regions as Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Classics HD and sometimes referred to as The Team Ico Collection) is a video game that contains high-definition remasters of two older PlayStation 2 games for the PlayStation 3. The two games, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, were developed by Sony Computer Entertainment's Team Ico, and who have assisted in the remastering alongside Bluepoint Games to provide support for high-definition monitors, higher frame rates, stereoscopic 3D, and additional features for the PlayStation Network. The two games, while fundamentally different in gameplay and story, are thematically connected, with Shadow considered a spiritual sequel to Ico, and the collection precedes the release of Team Ico's next game, The Last Guardian, which is also thematically tied to these games. Both games were critically acclaimed on their original release, while the remastered collection itself was positively praised by reviewers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/IcoShadow.jpg
