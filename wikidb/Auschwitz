80.0	Auschwitz	Auschwitz concentration camp	Auschwitz had for a long time been a German name for Oświęcim, the town by and around which the camps were located; the name "Auschwitz" was made the official name again by the Germans after they invaded Poland in September 1939. Birkenau, the German translation of Brzezinka (= "birch tree"), referred originally to a small Polish village that was destroyed by the Germans to make way for the camp.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Birkenau_gate.JPG/225px-Birkenau_gate.JPG
