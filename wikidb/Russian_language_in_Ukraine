3.61	Russian_language_in_Ukraine	Russian language in Ukraine	Russian is a minority language in Ukraine It is the most common first language in Donbass and Crimea regions, the predominant language in large cities in the East and South of the country. The usage and status of the language (currently Ukrainian is the only official language of Ukraine) is an object of political disputes within Ukrainian society and the considerable Russian minority of the country. The number of Russian-teaching schools has been systematically reduced since Ukrainian independence in 1991 and now it is much lower than the proportion of Russophones, but still higher than the proportion of ethnic Russians.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Meeting_in_Kharkov.jpg/250px-Meeting_in_Kharkov.jpg
