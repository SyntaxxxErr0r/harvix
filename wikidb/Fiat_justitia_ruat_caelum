In 1933, Judge Horton set aside the death sentence of Haywood Patterson, one of nine black men who were wrongfully convicted of raping two white women in Alabama. Judge Horton quoted the phrase when explaining why he made his decision, even though he knew it would mean the end of his judicial career. Similarly, Lord Mansfield, in reversing the outlawry of John Wilkes in 1770, used the phrase to reflect upon the duty of the Court.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Fiat_justitia_ruat_coelum_on_Drew_family_crest.JPG/220px-Fiat_justitia_ruat_coelum_on_Drew_family_crest.JPG
