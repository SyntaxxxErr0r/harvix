54.4	Triton_(moon)	Triton (moon)	Triton is the largest moon of the planet Neptune, discovered on October 10, 1846, by English astronomer William Lassell. It is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, which is an orbit in the opposite direction to its planet's rotation. At 2,700 km in diameter, it is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System. Because of its retrograde orbit and composition similar to Pluto's, Triton is thought to have been captured from the Kuiper belt. Triton has a surface of mostly frozen nitrogen, a mostly water ice crust, an icy mantle and a substantial core of rock and metal. The core makes up two-thirds of its total mass. Triton has a mean density of 2.061 grams per cubic centimetre (0.0745 lb/) and is composed of approximately 15â€“35% water ice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Triton_moon_mosaic_Voyager_2_%28large%29.jpg/300px-Triton_moon_mosaic_Voyager_2_%28large%29.jpg
