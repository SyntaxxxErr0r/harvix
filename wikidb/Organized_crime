67.1	Organized_crime	Organized crime	Organized crime or criminal organizations are transnational, national, or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals for the purpose of engaging in illegal activity, most commonly for monetary profit. Some criminal organizations, such as terrorist organizations, are politically motivated. Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them, as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for "protection". Gangs may become "disciplined" enough to be considered "organized". An organized gang or criminal set can also be referred to as a mob.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/AlCaponemugshotCPD.jpg/225px-AlCaponemugshotCPD.jpg
