54.7	Graphics_tablet	Graphics tablet	A graphics tablet (also digitizer, digitizing tablet, graphics pad, drawing tablet or pen tablet) is a computer input device that enables a user to hand-draw images and graphics, similar to the way a person draws images with a pencil and paper. These tablets may also be used to capture data or handwritten signatures. It can also be used to trace an image from a piece of paper which is taped or otherwise secured to the surface. Capturing data in this way, either by tracing or entering the corners of linear poly-lines or shapes is called digitizing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Wacom_graphics_tablet_and_pen.png/220px-Wacom_graphics_tablet_and_pen.png
