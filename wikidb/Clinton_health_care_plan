It listed minimum coverages and maximum annual out-of-pocket expenses for each plan. It proposed the establishment of corporate "regional alliances" of health providers to be subject to a fee-for-service schedule. People below a certain set income level were to pay nothing. The act listed funding to be sent to the states for the administration of this plan, beginning at $13.5 billion in 1993 and reaching $38.3 billion in 2003.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Clinton_health_care_elderly.jpg/300px-Clinton_health_care_elderly.jpg
