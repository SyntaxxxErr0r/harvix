3.01	Column_of_Arcadius	Column of Arcadius	The column of Arcadius was a Roman triumphal column begun in 401 in the forum of Arcadius in Constantinople to commemorate Arcadius's triumph over the Goths under Gainas in 400. Arcadius died in 408, but the decoration of the column was only completed in 421, so the monument was dedicated to his successor Theodosius II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Gurlitt_Arcadius_Column.jpg/220px-Gurlitt_Arcadius_Column.jpg
