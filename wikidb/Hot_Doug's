8.40	Hot_Doug's	Hot Doug's	Hot Doug's is a Chicago, Illinois-based restaurant specializing in a variety of hot dogs and sausages. The self-proclaimed "Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium" is in its second location at 3324 North California Avenue in the city's Avondale neighborhood. Its first location, on Roscoe Street, closed after a 2004 fire. Hot Doug's is frequently featured in local and national media for its unique menu, and its purveyor and head chef, Doug Sohn, has been noted for his work to create affordable gourmet food. The restaurant is an extremely popular dining destination among both locals and tourists, and at lunch time and throughout much of the weekend customers can expect to wait in lines sometimes exceeding an hour just to get in the door.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Hot_Doug%27s_Chicago_-_exterior.jpg/220px-Hot_Doug%27s_Chicago_-_exterior.jpg
