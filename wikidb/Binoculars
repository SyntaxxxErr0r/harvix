62.3	Binoculars	Binoculars	Binoculars, field glasses or binocular telescopes are a pair of identical or mirror-symmetrical telescopes mounted side-by-side and aligned to point accurately in the same direction, allowing the viewer to use both eyes when viewing distant objects. Most are sized to be held using both hands, although sizes vary widely from opera glasses to large pedestal mounted military models. Many different abbreviations are used for binoculars, including glasses, nocs, noculars, binos and bins.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Binocularp.svg/300px-Binocularp.svg.png
