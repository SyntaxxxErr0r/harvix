3.00	S-cam	S-cam	An S-cam is part of a braking system used in heavy vehicles such as trucks and wheeled machinery. It consists of a shaft, usually around 4 to 25 inches long, turned at one end by means of an air-powered brake booster and lever with an 'S' shaped cam at the wheel end. Turning the shaft pushes the brake shoes against the drum, producing friction.
