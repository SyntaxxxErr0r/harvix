3.30	Bramham_Park	Bramham Park	Bramham Park is a country house between Leeds and Wetherby, West Yorkshire, England. The Baroque mansion was built in 1698 by Robert Benson, 1st Baron Bingley. It has remained in the ownership of Benson's descendents since its completion in 1710. The house is surrounded by a landscaped park ornamented by a series of follies and avenues laid out in the 18th century landscape tradition. Following a fire in 1828 the house was derelict for 80 years until restored under the supervision of the architect Detmar Blow circa 1908. The house is named after the nearby village of Bramham.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Bramham_Park.gif/400px-Bramham_Park.gif
