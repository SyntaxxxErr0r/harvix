54.3	Popemobile	Popemobile	Popemobile is an informal name for the specially designed motor vehicles used by the pope during outdoor public appearances without having to employ the antiquated and often impractical sedia gestatoria. The Popemobile was designed to allow the pope to be more visible when greeting large crowds. There have been many different designs for popemobiles since Pope John Paul II first used a modified truck to greet crowds on his first trip to Poland as pope.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Popemobile_passes_the_White_House.jpg/250px-Popemobile_passes_the_White_House.jpg
