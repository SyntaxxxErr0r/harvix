94.1	Herb	Herb	In general use, herbs are any plants "with leaves, seeds, or flowers used for flavoring, food, medicine, or perfume" or parts of "such a plant as used in cooking". (In botanical use, the term "herb" is employed differently, for any non-woody flowering plant, regardless of its flavor, scent or other properties, and thus includes only grass-like plants and forbs.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Herbs.jpg/220px-Herbs.jpg
