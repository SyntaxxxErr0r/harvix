56.9	Operational_amplifier	Operational amplifier	An operational amplifier ("op-amp") is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output. An op-amp produces an output voltage that is typically hundreds of thousands times larger than the voltage difference between its input terminals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Ua741_opamp.jpg/300px-Ua741_opamp.jpg
