63.1	XMPP	Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol	Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol is an open-standard communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). The protocol was originally named Jabber, and was developed by the Jabber open-source community in 1999 for near-real-time, extensible instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance. Designed to be extensible, the protocol today also finds application in VoIP and file transfer signaling.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Logo_XMPP.svg/220px-Logo_XMPP.svg.png
