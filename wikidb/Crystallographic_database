2.40	Crystallographic_database	Crystallographic database	As of 2008, more than 700,000 crystal structures have been published and stored in crystal structure databases. The publishing rate has reached more than 50,000 crystal structures per year. These numbers refer to published and republished crystal structures from experimental data. Crystal structures are republished owing to corrections for symmetry errors, improvements of lattice and atomic parameters, and differences in diffraction technique or experimental conditions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cb/Trend_of_crystal_structures_in_databases.svg/250px-Trend_of_crystal_structures_in_databases.svg.png
