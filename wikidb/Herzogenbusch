Herzogenbusch was the only concentration camp run directly by the SS in western Europe outside of Germany. The camp was first used in 1943 and held 31,000 prisoners. 749 prisoners died in the camp, and the others were transferred to other camps shortly before the camp was liberated by the Allied Forces in 1944. After the war the camp was used as a prison for Germans. Today there is a visitors' center with exhibitions and a national monument remembering the camp and its victims.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Kamp_Vught_1945.jpg/230px-Kamp_Vught_1945.jpg
