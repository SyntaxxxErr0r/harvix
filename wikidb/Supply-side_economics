59.3	Supply-side_economics	Supply-side economics	Supply-side economics is a school of macroeconomic thought that argues that economic growth can be most effectively created by lowering barriers for people to produce (supply) goods and services, such as lowering income tax and capital gains tax rates, and by allowing greater flexibility by reducing regulation. According to supply-side economics, consumers will then benefit from a greater supply of goods and services at lower prices. Typical policy recommendations of supply-side economists are lower marginal tax rates and less regulation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/NYSE_opening_bell.jpg/250px-NYSE_opening_bell.jpg
