60.7	Philip_Guston	Philip Guston	Philip Guston (June 27, 1913 â€“ June 7, 1980) was a notable painter and printmaker in the New York School, which included many of the Abstract expressionists, such as Jackson Pollock and Willem De Kooning. In the late 1960s Guston helped to lead a transition from Abstract expressionism to Neo-expressionism in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d6/Gustonphilip.jpg/250px-Gustonphilip.jpg
