7.00	Indicative_planning	Indicative planning	Indicative planning is a form of economic planning implemented by a state in an effort to solve the problem of imperfect information in market and mixed-market economies and thus increase economic performance. When utilizing indicative planning, the state employs "influence, subsidies, grants, and taxes , but does not compel." Indicative planning is contrasted with directive or mandatory planning, where a state (or other economic unit) sets quotas and mandatory output requirements.
