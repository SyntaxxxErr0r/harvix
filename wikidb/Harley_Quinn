The character is a frequent accomplice and the girlfriend of Batman's nemesis the Joker, and is also close to Poison Ivy, from whom she gained her immunity to poisons and toxins, as well as her advanced physical abilities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/04/Harley_Quinn_cover_26.jpg/250px-Harley_Quinn_cover_26.jpg
