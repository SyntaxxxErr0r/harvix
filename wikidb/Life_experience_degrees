1.00	Life_experience_degrees	Diploma mill	In the UK, it is illegal to offer something that may be mistaken for a UK degree unless the awarding body is on a list maintained by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Degrees must be awarded by 'recognised bodies', which include universities and other higher education institutions with 'degree awarding powers'. However degree programmes may be advertised and run by a much wider range of 'listed bodies' whose academic standards and quality are assured by a 'recognised body' which formally awards the degree.
