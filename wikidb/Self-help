63.2	Self-help	Self-help	Self-help, or self-improvement, is a self-guided improvement—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help movements exist and each has its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. "Self-help culture, particularly Twelve-Step culture, has provided some of our most robust new language: recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Henoel_concerto.jpg/200px-Henoel_concerto.jpg
