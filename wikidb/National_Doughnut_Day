78.2	National_Doughnut_Day	National Doughnut Day	National Doughnut Day is on the first Friday of June each year, succeeding the Doughnut Day event created by the Salvation Army in 1938 to honor the women who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I. The holiday celebrates the doughnut (a.k.a "donut") â€” an edible, torus-shaped piece of dough which is deep-fried and sweetened. Many American doughnut stores offer free doughnuts on National Doughnut Day. In 2009, both independent doughnut shops and large national franchises offered free doughnuts in the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Rosquillas.JPG/200px-Rosquillas.JPG
