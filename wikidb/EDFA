2.10	EDFA	Optical amplifier	An optical amplifier is a device that amplifies an optical signal directly, without the need to first convert it to an electrical signal. An optical amplifier may be thought of as a laser without an optical cavity, or one in which feedback from the cavity is suppressed. Optical amplifiers are important in optical communication and laser physics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Doped_fibre_amplifier.svg/300px-Doped_fibre_amplifier.svg.png
