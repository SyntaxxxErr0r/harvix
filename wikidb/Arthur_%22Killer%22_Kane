6.01	Arthur_%22Killer%22_Kane	Arthur Kane	Arthur Kane (February 3, 1949 â€“ July 13, 2004) was a musician best known as the bass guitarist for the pioneering glam rock band the New York Dolls. He stated in the 2005 documentary film New York Doll that his nickname, Arthur "Killer" Kane, was inspired by the first article written about the Dolls in which the journalist described Kane's "killer bass" playing. He also suggested that it was inspired by the adversary of (the 1930's science fiction hero) Buck Rogers, a villainous character named Killer Kane. In addition to his bass playing, Kane was known for his influential fashion sense and his seemingly endless ability to utter original aphorisms in his uniquely-toned voice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Arthur_Kane.jpg/220px-Arthur_Kane.jpg
