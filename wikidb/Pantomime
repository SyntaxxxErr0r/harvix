70.7	Pantomime	Pantomime	Pantomime (informally, panto)— not to be confused with a mime artist, a theatrical performer of mime—is a musical-comedy theatrical production traditionally found in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, South Africa, India, Ireland, Gibraltar and Malta, and is mostly performed during the Christmas and New Year season. The word derives from the Greek "παντόμιμος" , "pantomimic actor" and that from "παντός" (pantos), genitive of "πᾶς" (pas), "every, all" + "μῖμος" (mimos), "imitator, actor".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/WarnePantomine1890.jpg/220px-WarnePantomine1890.jpg
