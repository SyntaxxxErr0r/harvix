176.1	Geoengineering	Geoengineering	The concept of geoengineering (or climate engineering, climate remediation, and climate intervention) refers to the deliberate large-scale engineering and manipulation of the planetary environment to combat or counteract anthropogenic changes in atmospheric chemistry. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2007 that geoengineering options, such as ocean fertilization to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, remained largely unproven. It was judged that reliable cost estimates for geoengineering had not yet been published.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Phytoplankton_SoAtlantic_20060215.jpg/220px-Phytoplankton_SoAtlantic_20060215.jpg
