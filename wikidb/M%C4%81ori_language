It has the status of an official language in New Zealand. Linguists classify it within the Eastern Polynesian languages as being closely related to Cook Islands Māori, Tuamotuan and Tahitian; somewhat less closely to Hawaiian and Marquesan; and more distantly to the languages of Western Polynesia, including Samoan, Tokelauan, Niuean and Tongan. According to the Maori Language Commission, the number of fluent adult speakers fell to about 10,000 in 1995.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/First_Lessons_in_Maori.jpg
