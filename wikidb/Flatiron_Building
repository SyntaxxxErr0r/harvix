94.5	Flatiron_Building	Flatiron Building	The Flatiron Building (or Fuller Building, as it was originally called) is located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan, New York City and is considered to be a groundbreaking skyscraper. Upon completion in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city and the only skyscraper north of 14th Street. The building sits on a triangular island-block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway and East 22nd Street, with 23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak. As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings, the name "Flatiron" derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Edificio_Fuller_%28Flatiron%29_en_2010_desde_el_Empire_State_crop_boxin.jpg/245px-Edificio_Fuller_%28Flatiron%29_en_2010_desde_el_Empire_State_crop_boxin.jpg
