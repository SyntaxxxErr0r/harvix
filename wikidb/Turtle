78.8	Turtle	Turtle	Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines (the crown group of the superorder Chelonia), characterised by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs that acts as a shield. "Turtle" may either refer to the Testudines as a whole, or to particular Testudines which make up a form taxon that is not monophyletic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Florida_Box_Turtle_Digon3_re-edited.jpg/250px-Florida_Box_Turtle_Digon3_re-edited.jpg
