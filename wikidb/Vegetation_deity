1.00	Vegetation_deity	Vegetation deity	In the Mesopotamian tradition, during the journey of Inanna or Ishtar to the underworld, the earth becomes sterile, and neither humans nor animals are able to procreate. After confronting Ereshkigal, her sister and ruler of the underworld, Inanna is killed, but an emissary from the gods administers potions to restore her to life. She is allowed to return to the upper world only if someone else will take her place. Her husband, the vegetation god Dumuzi, agrees to spend half the year in the underworld, during which time vegetation dies off. His return bring regrowth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/MotherGoddessFertility.JPG/100px-MotherGoddessFertility.JPG
