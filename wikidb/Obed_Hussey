2.00	Obed_Hussey	Obed Hussey	Obed Hussey (1792 â€“ August 4, 1860) was an American inventor, born to Quaker parents, of a farm machine called a reaper. In his youth, he was a sailor on a whaling ship, but eventually he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. He tested and patented a reaper in 1833, which placed him in fierce competition with Irish American inventor Cyrus McCormick. Both men made several patented innovations to the reaper, until Hussey was finally driven out of business. He sold the rights to McCormick in 1858 and died two years later.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/OBED_HUSSEY_c1850.jpg/170px-OBED_HUSSEY_c1850.jpg
