1.01	Pipra_pipra	White-crowned Manakin	The White-crowned Manakin is a tiny passerine bird in the manakin family. It is a resident breeder in the tropical New World from Costa Rica to northeastern Peru and eastern Brazil. It is normally placed in the genus Pipra, but its syringeal anatomy may favour its separation as a separate genus Dixiphia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Dixiphia_pipra_-_male.jpg/220px-Dixiphia_pipra_-_male.jpg
