71.2	Osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis (OA) also known as degenerative arthritis or degenerative joint disease or osteoarthrosis, is a group of mechanical abnormalities involving degradation of joints, including articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Symptoms may include joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, locking, and sometimes an effusion. A variety of causes—hereditary, developmental, metabolic, and mechanical—may initiate processes leading to loss of cartilage. When bone surfaces become less well protected by cartilage, bone may be exposed and damaged. As a result of decreased movement secondary to pain, regional muscles may atrophy, and ligaments may become more lax.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Gonarthrose-Knorpelaufbrauch.jpg/230px-Gonarthrose-Knorpelaufbrauch.jpg
