1.00	D'Achery	Luc d'Achery	D'Achery collected the historical materials for the "Acta Ordinis S. Benedicti" but Mabillon added so much to it in the way of prefaces, notes, and "excursus" that it is justly accounted as his work. D'Achery was the soul of the Maurist movement, and a type of the medieval Benedictine, humble and self-sacrificing, virtuous and learned. Despite continued illness he was foremost in all the labours of the French Benedictines of St. Maur, and was the master of many of the most illustrious among them, e.g. Mabillon. His valuable correspondence is preserved in the Biblioth√©que Nationale at Paris.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Spicilegium_sive_collectio_veterum_aliquot_scriptorum_1723_1_CEEC.jpg/220px-Spicilegium_sive_collectio_veterum_aliquot_scriptorum_1723_1_CEEC.jpg
