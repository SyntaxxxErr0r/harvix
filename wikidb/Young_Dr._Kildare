3.00	Young_Dr._Kildare	Young Dr. Kildare	Young Dr. Kildare is a 1938 film starring Lew Ayres as an idealistic but somewhat immature young medical doctor, who benefits greatly from the wise counsel of his mentor, Dr. Gillespie, a seasoned older physician. This was the second of a total of ten Dr. Kildare pictures, but the first starring Ayres (the character being portrayed by Joel McCrea in Internes Can't Take Money), and the first to introduce the mentoring Dr. Gillespie. The series eventually continued with pictures centering around Gillespie once Kildare had been phased out.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/81/Young_dr._kildare.gif
