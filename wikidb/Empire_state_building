It has a roof height of 1,250 feet (381 meters), and with its antenna spire included, it stands a total of 1,454 ft (443.2 m) high. Its name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State. It stood as the world's tallest building for 40 years, from its completion in 1931 until construction of the World Trade Center's North Tower was completed in 1972. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building was again the tallest building in New York (although it was no longer the tallest in the world). Once the new One World Trade Center is completed, the Empire State Building will once again be demoted to second tallest building in New York.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Empire_State_Building_from_the_Top_of_the_Rock.jpg/220px-Empire_State_Building_from_the_Top_of_the_Rock.jpg
