3.11	Logan_Canyon	Logan Canyon	Logan Canyon is a canyon that cuts its way through the Bear River Mountains, a branch of the Wasatch Range, in northeastern Utah. The canyon is popular for both summer and winter activities, especially rock-climbing, hiking, camping, fishing, snowmobiling, and skiing, at the Beaver Mountain ski resort. The canyon rises to an elevation of approximately 7,800 ft (2,400 m) after a vertical climb of about 2,900 feet (900 m). Just beyond the summit is a steep road leading into Bear Lake Valley and scenic overlooks that provide breathtaking views of deep blue Bear Lake. The western terminus is at Logan in Cache County and the eastern terminus is at Garden City in Rich County.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/LoganCanyonMouth.JPG/220px-LoganCanyonMouth.JPG
