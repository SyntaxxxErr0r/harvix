85.6	Ultimatum_game	Ultimatum game	The ultimatum game is a game often played in economic experiments in which two players interact to decide how to divide a sum of money that is given to them. The first player proposes how to divide the sum between the two players, and the second player can either accept or reject this proposal. If the second player rejects, neither player receives anything. If the second player accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. The game is played only once so that reciprocation is not an issue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Ultimatum_Game_Extensive_Form.svg/250px-Ultimatum_Game_Extensive_Form.svg.png
