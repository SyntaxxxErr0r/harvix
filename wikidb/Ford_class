1.00	Ford_class	Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier	The Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers (or Ford-class) are a class of supercarrier for the United States Navy, intended to eventually replace the current Nimitz-class carriers. The new vessels will use a hull design very similar to the Nimitz carriers in appearance, but many aspects of the design will be very different, implementing new technologies developed since the initial design of the previous class (such as the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System), as well as other design features intended to improve efficiency and running costs, including a reduced crew requirement. The first hull of the line will be named Gerald R. Ford, and will have the hull number CVN-78.Note 1	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/CVN-78_Artist_Image.jpg/300px-CVN-78_Artist_Image.jpg
