131.4	Sous-vide	Sous-vide	Sous-vide (French for "under vacuum") is a method of cooking food sealed in airtight plastic bags in a water bath for a long time—72 hours is not unusual—at an accurately determined temperature much lower than normally used for cooking, typically around 60 °C or 140 °F. The intention is to cook the item evenly, not overcook the outside while still keeping the inside at the same 'doneness' and to keep the food juicier.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Sous_Vide.jpg/220px-Sous_Vide.jpg
