74.1	Flat_Earth_Society	Flat Earth Society	The Flat Earth Society (also known as the International Flat Earth Society or the International Flat Earth Research Society) is an organization that seeks to further the belief that the Earth is flat instead of an oblate spheroid. The modern organization was founded by Englishman Samuel Shenton in 1956 and was later led by Charles K. Johnson, who based the organization in his home in Lancaster, California. The formal society was inactive after Johnsonâ€™s death in 2001 but was resurrected in 2004 by its new president Daniel Shenton.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Flat_earth.jpg/220px-Flat_earth.jpg
