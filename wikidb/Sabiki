3.20	Sabiki	Sabiki	A sabiki rig, sometimes called a piscatore rig, is a set of small lures typically used to catch fish that eat small prey. A sabiki is typically fished off boats, piers, jetties, or any structure over the water. Sabikis consist of any number (usually between 6 and 10) of small hooks each on a dropper line which is a few inches long. The individual dropper lines are then tied to a longer leader in series, about 6 inches apart; a weight is tied to the end of the leader. The individual hooks are decorated as lures, or tied like flies similar to those used in fly fishing. Often they have a simple piece of metallic or iridescent film attached to them. On any individual rig all of the lures will be identical. The type or size sabiki used depends on water conditions, species of fish sought or simply the angler's preference.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Float-tube-pikeangler.jpg/140px-Float-tube-pikeangler.jpg
