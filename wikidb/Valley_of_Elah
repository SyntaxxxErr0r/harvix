15.24	Valley_of_Elah	Valley of Elah	The Valley of Elah, "the valley of the oak or terebinth" (Arabic Wadi es-Sunt), best known as the place described in the Bible where the Israelites were encamped when David fought Goliath (1 Sam. 17:2, 19). It was near Azekah and Socho (17:1). On the west side of the valley, near Socho, there is a very large and ancient tree of this kind, 55 feet in height, its trunk 17 feet in circumference, and the breadth of its shade no less than 75 feet. It marks the upper end of the valley, and forms a noted object, being one of the largest terebinths in the area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Valley_of_Elah-Med_woodland.jpg/220px-Valley_of_Elah-Med_woodland.jpg
