The ridge is discontinuous, with the hills forming two main blocks, north and south of the "Beeston Gap". The main mass of those to the south are known as the Peckforton Hills; the larger group of hills to the north do not have a collective name.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Peckforton_Castle_from_Stanner_Nab.jpg/240px-Peckforton_Castle_from_Stanner_Nab.jpg
