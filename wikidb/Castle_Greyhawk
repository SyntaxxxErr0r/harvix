3.21	Castle_Greyhawk	Castle Greyhawk	Castle Greyhawk is one of the central dungeon settings in the fictional World of Greyhawk campaign setting for the Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game. The Castle was originally developed by Gary Gygax for his own campaign and later detailed for publication. Castle Greyhawk is also the name of a 1988 Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure module that offered a tongue-in-cheek treatment of the Castle. In 2005, Gary Gygax announced the release of "Castle Zagyg," his new treatment of the dungeon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/GreyhawkRuinsCover.jpg/220px-GreyhawkRuinsCover.jpg
