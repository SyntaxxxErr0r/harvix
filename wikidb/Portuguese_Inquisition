11.03	Portuguese_Inquisition	Portuguese Inquisition	The Portuguese Inquisition was formally established in Portugal in 1536 at the request of the King of Portugal, Jo√£o III. Manuel I had asked for the installation of the Inquisition in 1515 to fulfill the commitment of marriage with Maria of Aragon, but it was only after his death that Pope Paul III acquiesced. This inquisition was a Portuguese analogue of the Spanish Inquisition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/1685_-_Inquisi%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Portugal.jpg/200px-1685_-_Inquisi%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Portugal.jpg
