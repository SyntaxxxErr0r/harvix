The church has been located at the corner of Sixth and Lombard Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since that time, making it the oldest church property continuously owned by African Americans. The church was organized by African-American members of St. George's Methodist Church who walked out due to racial segregation in the worship services.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/MotherBethelAMEChurchPhila1.jpg/250px-MotherBethelAMEChurchPhila1.jpg
