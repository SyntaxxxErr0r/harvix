4.00	The_Miami_Metropolis	The Miami News	The Miami News was the dominant evening newspaper in Miami, Florida for most of the 20th century, its chief concurrent competitor being the morning-edition of The Miami Herald. The paper started publishing in May 1896 as a weekly called The Miami Metropolis. The Metropolis had become a daily (except Sunday) paper of eight pages by 1903. On June 4, 1923, former Ohio governor James Middleton Cox bought the Metropolis and renamed it the Miami Daily News-Metropolis. On January 4, 1925 the newspaper became the Miami Daily News, and published its first Sunday edition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Miami_News_logo%2C_1988.png/225px-Miami_News_logo%2C_1988.png
