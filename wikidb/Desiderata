Largely unknown in the author's lifetime, the text became widely known after its use in a devotional, after subsequently being found at Adlai Stevenson's deathbed in 1965, and after spoken-word recordings in 1971 and 1972.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b0/DesiderataOfHappiness.jpg/220px-DesiderataOfHappiness.jpg
