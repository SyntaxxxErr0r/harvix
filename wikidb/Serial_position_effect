56.2	Serial_position_effect	Serial position effect	The serial position effect, a term coined by Hermann Ebbinghaus through studies he performed on himself, refers to the finding that recall accuracy varies as a function of an item's position within a study list. When asked to recall a list of items in any order (free recall), people tend to begin recall with the end of the list, recalling those items best (the recency effect). Among earlier list items, the first few items are recalled more frequently than the middle items (the primacy effect).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Serial_position.png/250px-Serial_position.png
