2.00	Igbo_Jamaican	Igbo people in Jamaica	Igbo people in Jamaica are citizens of the Caribbean island-nation of Jamaica that are a whole or a significant part descended from the Igbo people of what is now Nigeria. Most of the Igbo people arrived to Jamaica by force on slave ships and taken to plantations to work as slaves and have therefore been fully assimilated. The Igbo were documented by the British plantation owners along with other ethnicities brought to Jamaica to work as slaves. The Igbo constituted a large portion of the African population of the island in the era of the slave trade; through the banning of African traditions by European plantation owners, many on the island have lost their African identities with their ancestors adopting a creole identity. There is no official count of the amount of Jamaicans with Igbo ancestry after the abolishment of the slave trade, but there are accounts and slave documents that have listed populations of certain African ethnic groups, including the Igbo, on plantations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/LocationIgboland.png/140px-LocationIgboland.png
