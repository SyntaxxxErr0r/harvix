1.00	Draft_horses	Draft horse	A draft horse (US), draught horse (UK) or dray horse (from the Old English dragan meaning to draw or haul; compare Dutch dragen meaning to carry), less often called a work horse or heavy horse, is a large horse bred for hard, heavy tasks such as ploughing and farm labor. There are a number of different breeds, with varying characteristics but all share common traits of strength, patience, and a docile temperament which made them indispensable to generations of pre-industrial farmers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/ShireDraftHorse.jpg/220px-ShireDraftHorse.jpg
