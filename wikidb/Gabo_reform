Historians debate the degree of Japanese influence in this program, as well as its effect in encouraging modernization. The name Gabo (갑오, 甲午) comes from the name of the year 1894 in the traditional sexagesimal cycle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Gungukgimucheo_joseokjin.jpg/220px-Gungukgimucheo_joseokjin.jpg
