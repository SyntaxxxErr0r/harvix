1.10	Bouncing_off_the_Satellites	Bouncing off the Satellites	Bouncing off the Satellites is the fourth studio album by New Wave band The B-52's, released on September 8, 1986. It was recorded in July 1985 and was produced by Tony Mansfield. Guitarist Ricky Wilson died of AIDS during the recording. With the band too distraught to tour, the album received minimal promotion and failed to yield any hits despite some stations initially giving good airplay to "Summer of Love". The album was seen as a departure from the band's original New Wave sound; as a result, the album was initially a critical and commercial failure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/81/The_B-52%27s_-_Bouncing_Off_the_Satellites.jpg
