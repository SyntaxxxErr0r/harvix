1.10	Palnetoke	Palnatoke	Palnatoke or Palnatoki, sometimes written Palna-Toki or Palna Toki , was a legendary Danish hero and chieftain of the island of Fyn. He raised Harald Bluetooth's son Sweyn Forkbeard and was a staunch supporter of the old pagan faith. He convinced Sweyn to wage war on his own father, and according to some accounts, Palnatoki himself slew Harald. In addition to religious motives, he may have been taking revenge for the death of his grandfather, the Geatish earl Jarl Ottar, who was killed when Harald invaded GÃ¶taland.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/Palnetoki.jpg/150px-Palnetoki.jpg
