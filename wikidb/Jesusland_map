57.08	Jesusland_map	Jesusland map	The Jesusland map is an Internet meme, created shortly after the 2004 United States Presidential election, which satirizes the red/blue states scheme by dividing the United States and Canada into "The United States of Canada" and "Jesusland". The two areas are seen as having fundamental differences in ideology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Jesusland_map.svg/300px-Jesusland_map.svg.png
