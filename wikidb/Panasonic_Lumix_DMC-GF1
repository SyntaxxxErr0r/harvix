6.10	Panasonic_Lumix_DMC-GF1	Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1	Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 is the third camera in Panasonic's Lumix G-series, using the Micro Four Thirds System. Its body design similar to that of the recently released Olympus E-P1, the GF1 is 35% smaller than earlier G models. It has the same 12.1Mp sensor as the DMC-G1, 1280 × 720 HD recording in AVCHD Lite format, an optional hot-shoe mounted electronic viewfinder, and a 3 inch LCD with 460,000 dots. It was announced at the 2009 Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin consumer electronics exhibition. Before being officially launched its pictures were released on sites such as photorumors. This model in the Lumix range from Panasonic was said by Panasonic at the time to be the world’s smallest and lightest system digital camera with a built-in flash capability.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Panasonic_Lumix_GF1_img_3537.jpg/300px-Panasonic_Lumix_GF1_img_3537.jpg
