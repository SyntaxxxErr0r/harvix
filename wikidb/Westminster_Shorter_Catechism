23.86	Westminster_Shorter_Catechism	Westminster Shorter Catechism	The Westminster Shorter Catechism (also known simply as the Shorter Catechism, hereinafter referred to as the WSC) was written in the 1640s by English and Scottish divines. The assembly also produced the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Westminster Larger Catechism. The three documents are considered by many Protestants to be the grandest doctrinal statements to come out of the English Reformation. Completed in 1647, it was presented to the Long Parliament on 14 April 1648.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Westerminster_catechism_first_page.jpg/300px-Westerminster_catechism_first_page.jpg
