63.8	Koch_snowflake	Koch snowflake	The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch star and Koch island) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled "On a continuous curve without tangents, constructible from elementary geometry" (original French title: Sur une courbe continue sans tangente, obtenue par une construction géométrique élémentaire) by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/KochFlake.svg/280px-KochFlake.svg.png
