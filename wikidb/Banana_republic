73.1	Banana_republic	Banana republic	A banana republic is a politically unstable country that economically depends upon the exports of a limited resource (e.g. fruits, minerals), which usually has an impoverished working class who are ruled by a wealthy elite. In political science, banana republic denotes a country dependent upon limited primary-sector productions, which is ruled by a plutocracy who exploit the national economy by means of a politico-economic oligarchy. In American literature, banana republic originally denoted the fictional “Republic of Anchuria”, a “servile dictatorship” that abetted, or supported for kickbacks, the exploitation of large-scale plantation agriculture, especially banana cultivation. In U.S. politics, the term banana republic is a pejorative political descriptor coined by the American writer O. Henry in Cabbages and Kings (1904), a book of thematically related short stories derived from his 1896–97 residence in Honduras, where he was hiding from U.S. law for bank embezzlement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/William_Sydney_Porter_by_doubleday.jpg/185px-William_Sydney_Porter_by_doubleday.jpg
