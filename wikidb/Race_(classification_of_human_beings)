78.7	Race_(classification_of_human_beings)	Race (classification of humans)	Race is a classification system used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by heritable phenotypic characteristics, geographic ancestry, physical appearance, and ethnicity. In the early twentieth century the term was often used, in its taxonomic sense, to denote genetically diverse human populations whose members possessed similar phenotypes. This sense of "race" is still used within forensic anthropology (when analyzing skeletal remains), biomedical research, and race-based medicine. In addition, law enforcement utilizes race in profiling suspects and to reconstruct the faces of unidentified remains. Because in many societies, racial groupings correspond closely with patterns of social stratification, for social scientists studying social inequality, race can be a significant variable. As sociological factors, racial categories may in part reflect subjective attributions, self-identities, and social institutions. Accordingly, the racial paradigms employed in different disciplines vary in their emphasis on biological reduction as contrasted with societal construction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Meyers_b11_s0476a.jpg/300px-Meyers_b11_s0476a.jpg
