54.9	Telomerase	Telomerase	Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that is an enzyme which adds DNA sequence repeats ("TTAGGG" in all vertebrates) to the 3' end of DNA strands in the telomere regions, which are found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. This region of repeated nucleotide called telomeres contains noncoding DNA and hinders the loss of important DNA from chromosome ends. As a result, every time the chromosome is copied only 100â€“200 nucleotides are lost, which causes no damage to the organism's DNA. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that carries its own RNA molecule, which is used as a template when it elongates telomeres, which are shortened after each replication cycle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Telomerase_illustration.jpg/240px-Telomerase_illustration.jpg
