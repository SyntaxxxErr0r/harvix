3.11	Art_and_architecture_of_Assyria	Architecture of Mesopotamia	The architecture of Mesopotamia is the ancient architecture of the region of the Tigrisâ€“Euphrates river system (also known as Mesopotamia), encompassing several distinct cultures and spanning a period from the 10th millennium BC, when the first permanent structures were built, to the 6th century BC. Among the Mesopotamian architectural accomplishments are the development of urban planning, the courtyard house, and ziggurats. No architectural profession existed in Mesopotamia; however, scribes drafted and managed construction for the government, nobility, or royalty. The Mesopotamians regarded 'the craft of building' as a divine gift taught to men by the gods as listed in me 28.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Reconstructed_Babylon_-1.jpg/250px-Reconstructed_Babylon_-1.jpg
