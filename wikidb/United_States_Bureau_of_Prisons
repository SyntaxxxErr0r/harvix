1.00	United_States_Bureau_of_Prisons	Federal Bureau of Prisons	The Federal Bureau of Prisons (often referred to operationally as the BOP) is a federal law enforcement agency subdivision of the United States Department of Justice and is responsible for the administration of the federal prison system. The system also handles prisoners who committed acts considered felonies under the District of Columbia's law. The Bureau was established in 1930 to provide more progressive and humane care for federal inmates, to professionalize the prison service, and to ensure consistent and centralized administration of the 11 federal prisons in operation at the time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Federal_Bureau_of_Prisons_Seal.svg/200px-Federal_Bureau_of_Prisons_Seal.svg.png
