1.00	Watered	Watering can	A watering can is a portable container, usually with a handle and a spout, used to water plants by hand. It has existed since at least the 17th century and has since been improved. It is used for many other uses too, as it is a fairly versatile tool.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/MetalwateringcansDec08.jpg/220px-MetalwateringcansDec08.jpg
