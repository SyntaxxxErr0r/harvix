85.0	Garam_masala	Garam masala	Garam masala (from Hindi: , garam ("hot") and masala ("mixture")) is a blend of ground spices common in North Indian and other South Asian cuisines. It is used alone or with other seasonings. The word garam refers to intensity of the spices rather than capsaicin content. Garam masala is pungent, but not hot in the same way as a chili pepper.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Garammasalaphoto.jpg/250px-Garammasalaphoto.jpg
