20.64	Salmiakki_Koskenkorva	Salmiakki Koskenkorva	Salmiakki Koskenkorva, (also Salmiakkikossu for short or generically as Salmari) is a pre-mixed liqueur which caused a minor revolution in drinking culture in Finland during the 1990s. Canonically salmiakkikossu consists of Koskenkorva Viina vodka and ground up Turkish Pepper brand salty liquorice. Very similar drinks are popular in Denmark, but are referred to with names like "sorte svin" or "små grå" (little grays) instead. In Northern Germany, there is also another very similar drink with the name "Schwarze Sau" (black sow) which is based on Doppelkorn instead of vodka. It is most popular in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein and often associated with that state.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Illustration_Glycyrrhiza_glabra.jpg/220px-Illustration_Glycyrrhiza_glabra.jpg
