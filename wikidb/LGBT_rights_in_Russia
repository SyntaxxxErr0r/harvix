9.00	LGBT_rights_in_Russia	LGBT rights in Russia	Lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender persons in Russia may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents, though many advances have been made in the past two decades. As of 2008 (when Men who have sex with men were finally allowed to donate blood), Russia has no criminal law on federal level directed at LGBT people, but since male homosexual acts were decriminalized in 1993, there are no laws protecting against discrimination or harassment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity . However, local legislature of Ryazan region legislatively prohibited "propaganda of homosexuality among minors" and established fines for that administrative offense. A similar law was passed in Arkhangelsk region in September 2011.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Russian_Federation_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/250px-Russian_Federation_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png
