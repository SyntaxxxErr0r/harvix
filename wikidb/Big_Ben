84.8	Big_Ben	Big Ben	Big Ben is the nickname for the great bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London, and is generally extended to refer to the clock or the clock tower (officially known simply as Clock Tower) as well. The clock tower holds the largest four-faced chiming clock in the world and is the third-tallest free-standing clock tower. It celebrated its 150th anniversary on 31 May 2009, during which celebratory events took place. The tower was completed on 10 April 1858 and has become one of the most prominent symbols of both London and England, often in the establishing shot of films set in the city.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Clock_Tower_-_Palace_of_Westminster%2C_London_-_September_2006-2.jpg/220px-Clock_Tower_-_Palace_of_Westminster%2C_London_-_September_2006-2.jpg
