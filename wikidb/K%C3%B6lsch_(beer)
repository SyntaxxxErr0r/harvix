52.1	K%C3%B6lsch_(beer)	Kölsch (beer)	Kölsch, also written Koelsch, is a local beer specialty brewed in Cologne, Germany. It is a clear beer with a bright straw-yellow hue, and it has a prominent, but not extreme, hoppiness. It is less bitter than the standard German pale lager. Furthermore, Kölsch is warm fermented at a temperature around 13 to 21°C (55 to 70°F) and then cold-conditioned, or lagered. This manner of fermentation links Kölsch with some other beer styles of central northern Europe, such as the Altbiers of northern Germany and the Netherlands.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Kranz_Koelsch.jpg/220px-Kranz_Koelsch.jpg
