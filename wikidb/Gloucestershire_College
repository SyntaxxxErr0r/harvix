2.10	Gloucestershire_College	Gloucestershire College	Gloucestershire College abbreviated GC (formerly known as Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology, abbreviated GLOSCAT) is a college of further education in the county of Gloucestershire, United Kingdom. It has its main campuses at large purpose-built facilities in Cheltenham and Gloucester, and also several smaller sites around the county including the Construction School in Kingsditch and Do I.T. Centres in Cheltenham, Gloucester and at the Tewkesbury Launchpad Centre. The college campus at Gloucester relocated the former campus to a brownfield site within Gloucester Docks. The building won the Civic Trust Award for Best Climate Friendly Scheme July 2008. In early 2011 it merged with the former Royal Forest of Dean College and thus acquired the sites of that college to safeguard the provision of Higher Education in that region.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/GlousColl-logo.jpg
