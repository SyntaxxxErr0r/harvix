3.00	Eyelets	Grommet	A grommet is a ring inserted into a hole through thin material, such as fabric. Grommets are generally flared or collared on each side to keep them in place, and are often made of metal, plastic, or rubber. They may be used to prevent tearing or abrasion of the pierced material, to cover sharp edges of the piercing, or both. A small grommet may also be called an eyelet, used on shoes for lacing purposes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Rubbergrommets.jpg/250px-Rubbergrommets.jpg
