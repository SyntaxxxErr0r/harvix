73.9	Malnutrition	Malnutrition	Malnutrition is the condition that results from taking an unbalanced diet in which certain nutrients are lacking, in excess (too high an intake), or in the wrong proportions. A number of different nutrition disorders may arise, depending on which nutrients are under or overabundant in the diet. In most of the world, malnutrition is present in the form of undernutrition. While malnutrition is more common in developing countries, it is also present in industrialized countries. In wealthier nations it is more likely to be caused by unhealthy diets with excess energy, fats, and refined carbohydrates. A growing trend of obesity is now a major public health concern in lower socio-economic levels and in developing countries as well.Because it contributes to both overnutrition and undernutrition, malnutrition is said to be a “double burden.”	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Orange_ribbon.svg/120px-Orange_ribbon.svg.png
