The Voyager class ships were built at Kvaerner Masa Yard’s (now STX Finland Cruise Oy) facility in Turku, Finland. The ships have a diesel-electric powertrain. They are powered by six Wärtsilä Vasa 46 diesel engines, giving a total output of 75,600 kW. The generated electric power drives three 14 MW ABB Azipod azimuth thrusters (two steerable and one fixed).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Adventure_of_the_Seas_Wade_2012.JPG/300px-Adventure_of_the_Seas_Wade_2012.JPG
