1.01	Gdbserver	Gdbserver	gdbserver is a computer program that makes it possible to remotely debug other programs. Running on the same system as the program to be debugged, it allows the GNU Debugger to connect from another system; that is, only the executable to be debugged needs to be resident on the target system, while the source code and a copy of the binary file to be debugged reside on the developerâ€™s local computer. The connection can be either TCP or a serial line.
