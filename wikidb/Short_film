54.7	Short_film	Short film	A short film is any film not long enough to be considered a feature film. No consensus exists as to where that boundary is drawn: the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as "an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/William_Garwood.jpg
