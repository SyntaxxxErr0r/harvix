8.41	DK_Bongos	DK Bongos	DK Bongos are bongo-like controllers for the Nintendo GameCube video game series Donkey Konga, Donkey Konga 2, Donkey Konga 3, and Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat. There are two bongos, each shaped like a classic Donkey Kong barrel with a rubber drumskin fastened on top. It also has a built-in microphone to detect clapping. In Japan the controller is called the "TaruKonga" (or "TaruConga") controller. The name is a multilayered pun, combining "Taru" (the Japanese word for "barrel"), "Kon" or "Con" (a suffix used by Namco when naming their original peripherals, such as the "GunCon", or the "TaTaCon"), and Konga (or Conga).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/DK-Bongos.JPG/250px-DK-Bongos.JPG
