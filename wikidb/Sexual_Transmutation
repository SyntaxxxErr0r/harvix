1.00	Sexual_Transmutation	Sublimation (psychology)	In psychology, sublimation is a mature type of defence mechanism where socially unacceptable impulses or idealizations are consciously transformed into socially acceptable actions or behaviour, possibly converting the initial impulse in the long term. According to Wade and Tavris, sublimation is when displacement "serves a higher cultural or socially useful purpose, as in the creation of art or inventions.". As used by Freud, the word designated the concept of a spiritual redirection of the libido, and has roots in his psychoanalytical theory.
