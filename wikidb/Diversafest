6.00	Diversafest	Diversafest	Diversafest (Dfest), Oklahoma's Music Conference and Festival, was an annual live event that showcased independent and emerging artists and hosted educational music industry panels and a tradeshow. Dfest took place the last weekend in July in the historic Blue Dome District of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The music conference and festival had the purpose of promoting and empowering emerging artists from around the United States. By 2008 Dfest had grown to include more than 140 bands performing on over 10 stages in downtown Tulsa and featuring music industry panels, clinics and a tradeshow during the days at the host conference hotel. Attendance over the two-day event in 2009 was nearly 70,000. However, the 2010 festival was cancelled. There has been no news on a possible return of Dfest in 2011.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/DFestNewLogoWeb.jpg
