Satellite TV tuners are also available as a card or a USB stick to be attached to a personal computer. In many areas of the world satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, often to areas that are not serviced by terrestrial or cable providers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/53/Astro_satellite_dishes.jpg/160px-Astro_satellite_dishes.jpg
