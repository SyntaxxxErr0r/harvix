6.41	Lusitanians	Lusitanians	The Lusitanians (or Lusitani in Latin) were a tribe living in the west of the Iberian Peninsula long before it became the Roman province of Lusitania (most of modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca). They spoke the Lusitanian language, an Indo-European language which might have been a form of Celtic or influenced by Celtic. Modern Portuguese people see the Lusitanians as their ancestors. The most notable Lusitanian was Viriathus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Ethnographic_Iberia_200_BCE.PNG/360px-Ethnographic_Iberia_200_BCE.PNG
