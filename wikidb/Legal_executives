1.00	Legal_executives	Legal executive	Legal executives are a form of trained and qualified legal professional in certain juridictions. They often specialise in a particular area of law. There is, however, no direct equivalent to a legal executive in Scotland. Law clerks in Canada and paralegals in the US occupy the same role as legal executives elsewhere while having lesser professional status. Legal executives are recognised in England and Wales, both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong. In England and Wales they are now know as "chartered legal executives".
