56.4	Nathan_Hale	Nathan Hale	Nathan Hale (June 6, 1755 â€“ September 22, 1776) was a soldier for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He volunteered for an intelligence-gathering mission in New York City but was captured by the British. He is probably best remembered for his purported last words before being hanged: "I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country." Hale has long been considered an American hero and, in 1985, he was officially designated the state hero of Connecticut.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Nathan-hale-cityhall.jpg/220px-Nathan-hale-cityhall.jpg
