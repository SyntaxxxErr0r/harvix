116.2	Corporate_personhood	Corporate personhood	Although the Federal government has from time to time chartered corporations, the general chartering of corporations has been left to the states. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, corporations began to be chartered in greater numbers by the states. Corporations had long existed in the new nation, but these were primarily educational corporations or institutions chartered by the British crown which continued to exist after the new nation was created from the Confederation. Due to experience as British Colonies, new corporations were greeted with mixed feelings. Before, British corporations were chartered by the crown to do business in North America. Most of these entities were able to operate and derived their right to exist from the foreign colonial ruling power. They were able to do business through government grants of monopoly as part of the chartering process. For example, the controversial Bank Bill of 1791 chartered a 20 year corporate monopoly for the First Bank of the United States, but, after the charter expired in 1811, the bank was bought out by Philadelphia banker Stephen Girard.
