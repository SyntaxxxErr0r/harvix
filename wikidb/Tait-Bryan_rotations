4.11	Tait-Bryan_rotations	Euler angles	The Euler angles are three angles introduced by Leonhard Euler to describe the orientation of a rigid body. To describe such an orientation in 3-dimensional Euclidean space three parameters are required. They can be given in several ways, Euler angles being one of them; see charts on SO(3) for others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Eulerangles.svg/300px-Eulerangles.svg.png
