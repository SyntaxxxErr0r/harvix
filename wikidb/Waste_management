80.1	Waste_management	Waste management	Waste management is the collection, transport, processing or disposal, managing and monitoring of waste materials. The term usually relates to materials produced by human activity, and the process is generally undertaken to reduce their effect on health, the environment or aesthetics. Waste management is a distinct practice from resource recovery which focuses on delaying the rate of consumption of natural resources. The management of wastes treats all materials as a single class, whether solid, liquid, gaseous or radioactive substances, and tried to reduce the harmful environmental impacts of each through different methods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Kathmandu-M%C3%BCllabfuhr.jpg/220px-Kathmandu-M%C3%BCllabfuhr.jpg
