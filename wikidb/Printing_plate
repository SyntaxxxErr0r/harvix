1.10	Printing_plate	Offset printing	Offset printing is a commonly used printing technique in which the inked image is transferred (or "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used in combination with the lithographic process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains ink from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a water-based film (called "fountain solution"), keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/DE-Zeitungsrollenoffsetdruck_by_Steschke.jpg/220px-DE-Zeitungsrollenoffsetdruck_by_Steschke.jpg
