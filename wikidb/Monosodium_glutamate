100.3	Monosodium_glutamate	Monosodium glutamate	Monosodium glutamate, also known as sodium glutamate or MSG, is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, one of the most abundant naturally occurring non-essential amino acids. It has been classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and by the European Union as a food additive. MSG has the HS code 29224220 and the E number E621. The glutamate of MSG confers the same umami taste of glutamate from other foods, being chemically identical. Industrial food manufacturers market and use MSG as a flavor enhancer because it balances, blends and rounds the total perception of other tastes. Trade names of monosodium glutamate include AJI-NO-MOTOÂ®, Vetsin, and Ac'cent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Monosodium_glutamate.svg/120px-Monosodium_glutamate.svg.png
