2.31	Went_the_Day_Well%3F	Went the Day Well?	"Went the Day Well?" is a British war film produced by Ealing Studios in 1942 as unofficial propaganda. It tells of how an English village is taken over by German paratroopers . Made during the war, it reflects the greatest potential nightmares of many Britons of the time, although the threat of invasion had largely receded by this point. (Germany's planned invasion, Operation Sea Lion, had been indefinitely postponed.) It includes the first major role of Thora Hird, and one of the last of C.V. France. It was filmed in Turville, Buckinghamshire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/60/Went_the_Day_Well_Poster.jpg/220px-Went_the_Day_Well_Poster.jpg
