60.7	Heinrich_Hertz	Heinrich Hertz	Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (22 February 1857 – 1 January 1894) was a German physicist who clarified and expanded the electromagnetic theory of light that had been put forth by James Clerk Maxwell. He was the first to conclusively prove the existence of electromagnetic waves by engineering instruments to transmit and receive radio pulses using experimental procedures that ruled out all other known wireless phenomena. The scientific unit of frequency — cycles per second — was named the "hertz" in his honor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Heinrich_Rudolf_Hertz.jpg/230px-Heinrich_Rudolf_Hertz.jpg
