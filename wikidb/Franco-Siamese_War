6.02	Franco-Siamese_War	Franco-Siamese War	The Franco-Siamese War of 1893 was a conflict between the French Third Republic and the Kingdom of Siam. Auguste Pavie, French vice consul in Luang Prabang in 1886, was the chief agent in furthering French interests in Laos. His intrigues, which took advantage of Siamese weakness in the region and periodic invasions by Vietnamese rebels from Tonkin, increased tensions between Bangkok and Paris. Following the conflict, the Siamese agreed to cede Laos to France, an act that led to the significant expansion of French Indochina.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Art_of_Paknam_incident.jpg/250px-Art_of_Paknam_incident.jpg
