55.9	Sacrum	Sacrum	In vertebrate anatomy the sacrum (plural: sacrums or sacra) is a large, triangular bone at the base of the spine and at the upper and back part of the pelvic cavity, where it is inserted like a wedge between the two hip bones. Its upper part connects with the last lumbar vertebra, and bottom part with the coccyx (tailbone). It consists of usually five initially unfused vertebrae which begin to fuse between ages 16â€“18 and are usually completely fused into a single bone by age 34.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Gray95.png/250px-Gray95.png
