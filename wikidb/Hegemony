95.1	Hegemony	Hegemony	Hegemony is an indirect form of imperial dominance in which the hegemon (leader state) rules sub-ordinate states by the implied means of power rather than direct military force. In Ancient Greece (8th c. BC – AD 6th c.), hegemony denoted the politico–military dominance of a city-state over other city-states. In the 19th century, hegemony denoted the predominance of one country upon others; from which derives hegemonism, the Great Power politics meant to establish hegemony. In 20th-century political science, the concept of hegemony is central to cultural hegemony, a philosophic and sociologic concept popularized by Marxist scholar Antonio Gramsci, which argues that one social class manipulates societal value system to create a world view justifying the status quo of bourgeois domination over other social classes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Gramsci.png/180px-Gramsci.png
