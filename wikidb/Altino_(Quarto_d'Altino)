1.00	Altino_(Quarto_d'Altino)	Altinum	Altinum (modern Altino, a frazione of Quarto d'Altino) is the name of an ancient coastal town of the Veneti 15 km SE of the modern Treviso, northern Italy, on the edge of the lagoons. Located on the eastern coast of that nation, at the mouth of the river Silis, it was first destroyed by Attila in 452 and gradually abandoned by its inhabitants, who sought refuge in the islands of the lagoon, such as Torcello and Burano, in the area where later Venice would be built.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Altino_scavi.JPG/260px-Altino_scavi.JPG
