1.20	Old_Spanish	Old Spanish language	Old Spanish, also known as Old Castilian (Spanish: ) or Mediaeval Spanish (Spanish: ), is an early form of the Spanish language that was spoken on the Iberian Peninsula from the tenth century until roughly the beginning of the fifteenth century, before a consonantal readjustment gave rise to the evolution of modern Spanish. The epic poem Cantar de Mio Cid, published around 1200, remains the best-known and most extensive work of literature in Old Spanish.
