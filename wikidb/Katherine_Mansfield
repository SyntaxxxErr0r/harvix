52.7	Katherine_Mansfield	Katherine Mansfield	Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp Murry (14 October 1888 â€“ 9 January 1923) was a prominent modernist writer of short fiction who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. Mansfield left for Great Britain in 1908 where she encountered Modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf with whom she became close friends. Her stories often focus on moments of disruption and frequently open rather abruptly. Among her most well-known stories are "The Garden Party", "The Daughters of the Late Colonel" and "The Fly." During the First World War Mansfield contracted extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which rendered any return or visit to New Zealand impossible and led to her death at the age of 34.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Katherinemansfield.jpg/180px-Katherinemansfield.jpg
