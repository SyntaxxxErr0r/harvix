60.2	Kilt	Kilt	The kilt is a knee-length garment with pleats at the rear, originating in the traditional dress of men and boys in the Scottish Highlands of the 16th century. Since the 19th century it has become associated with the wider culture of Scotland in general, or with Celtic (and more specifically Gaelic) heritage even more broadly. It is most often made of woollen cloth in a tartan pattern.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Scottish_mercenaries_in_the_Thirty_Years_War.jpg/360px-Scottish_mercenaries_in_the_Thirty_Years_War.jpg
