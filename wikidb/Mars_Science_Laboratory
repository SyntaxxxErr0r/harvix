69.9	Mars_Science_Laboratory	Mars Science Laboratory	The Mars Science Laboratory is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) mission to land and operate a rover named Curiosity on the surface of Mars. Currently in transit to Mars, it was launched November 26, 2011, at 10:02 EST and is scheduled to land on Mars at Gale Crater, near Mount Sharp, on August 6, 2012. If MSL arrives at Mars, it will attempt a more precise landing than attempted previously and then help assess Mars's habitability. A primary mission objective is to determine whether Mars is or has ever been able to support life, though it will not look for any specific type of life. Rather, it is intended to chemically analyze samples in various ways, including scooping up soil, drilling rocks, and using a laser and sensor system. Four major goals are to study Martian geology, study Martian climate, collect data for a human mission, and tackle the aforementioned life questions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Mars_Science_Laboratory_Curiosity_rover.jpg/300px-Mars_Science_Laboratory_Curiosity_rover.jpg
