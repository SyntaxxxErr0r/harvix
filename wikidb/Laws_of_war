55.7	Laws_of_war	Laws of war	The law of war is a body of law concerning acceptable justifications to engage in war and the limits to acceptable wartime conduct (jus in bello or International humanitarian law). The law of war is considered an aspect of public international law (the law of nations) and is distinguished from other bodies of law, such as the domestic law of a particular belligerent to a conflict, that may also provide legal limits to the conduct or justification of war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Original_Geneva_Conventions.jpg/220px-Original_Geneva_Conventions.jpg
