27.37	Goalkeeper_(association_football)	Goalkeeper (association football)	In association football, the goalkeeper occupies a position that represents the last line of defence between the opponent's offence and his own team's goal. The primary role of the goalkeeper is to defend his team's goal and prevent the opposition from scoring a goal. The goalkeeper is the only player who is permitted to touch the ball with his hands or arms in open play (within his own penalty area). Each team is required to have a goalkeeper on the field at all times during a match. If a goalkeeper is forced to leave a match due to injury or being sent off, another player must occupy the post if the team has no substitute goalkeeper available and/or has used up its allotted substitutions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Soccer_goalkeeper.jpg/220px-Soccer_goalkeeper.jpg
