170.2	Medicare_(United_States)	Medicare (United States)	Medicare is a national social insurance program, administered by the U.S. federal government, that guarantees access to health insurance for Americans ages 65 and older and younger people with disabilities as well as people with end stage renal disease. As a social insurance program, Medicare spreads the financial risk associated with illness across society to protect everyone, and thus has a somewhat different social role than private insurers, which must manage their risk portfolio to guarantee their own solvency.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Lyndon_Johnson_signing_Medicare_bill%2C_with_Harry_Truman%2C_July_30%2C_1965.jpg/250px-Lyndon_Johnson_signing_Medicare_bill%2C_with_Harry_Truman%2C_July_30%2C_1965.jpg
