58.4	Quicksilver_(software)	Quicksilver (software)	Quicksilver is a computer utility software program for Mac OS X, originally developed by Blacktree Software and distributed freely. It is essentially a graphical shell for the Mac OS X operating system, allowing users to use the keyboard to rapidly perform tasks such as launching applications, manipulating files, or sending e-mail. It is similar to the Mac OS X applications LaunchBar and Alfred, but uses a different interaction paradigm. Because of its flexible interface and extensibility, Quicksilver has been frequently called one of the top productivity apps on the Mac.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/86/Safari_selected_in_Quicksilver.png/200px-Safari_selected_in_Quicksilver.png
