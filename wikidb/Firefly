51.9	Firefly	Firefly	Lampyridae is a family of insects in the beetle order Coleoptera. They are winged beetles, and commonly called fireflies or lightning bugs for their conspicuous crepuscular use of bioluminescence to attract mates or prey. Fireflies produce a "cold light", with no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies. This chemically-produced light from the lower abdomen may be yellow, green, or pale-red, with wavelengths from 510 to 670 nanometers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Photuris_lucicrescens.jpg/220px-Photuris_lucicrescens.jpg
