1.01	Bermudadreieck	Bermudadreieck	The Bermudadreieck (Bermuda Triangle) in the center of Bochum is the designation for an area with a high density of bars and restaurants. It is located between SÃ¼dring and Konrad-Adenauer-Platz. The number of gastronomic establishemnts has increased since the beginning of the 1980s, spurred by the short distance to the Bochum Theater, Union Theater and the main train station.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/070502_005_00.jpg/220px-070502_005_00.jpg
