56.6	Plasmid	Plasmid	In microbiology and genetics, a plasmid is a DNA molecule that is separate from, and can replicate independently of, the chromosomal DNA. They are double-stranded and, in many cases, circular. Plasmids usually occur naturally in bacteria, but are sometimes found in eukaryotic organisms (e.g., the 2-micrometre ring in Saccharomyces cerevisiae).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Plasmid_%28english%29.svg/300px-Plasmid_%28english%29.svg.png
