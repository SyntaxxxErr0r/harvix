52.3	Passenger_Pigeon	Passenger Pigeon	The Passenger Pigeon or Wild Pigeon was a bird that existed in North America until the early 20th century when it went extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction. The species lived in enormous migratory flocks. One sighting in 1866 in southern Ontario was described as being 1 mile wide, 300 miles long, and taking 14 hours to pass a single point with number estimates in excess of 3.5 billion birds in the flock. That number, if accurate, would likely represent a large fraction of the entire population at the time.A	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Passengerpigeon.jpg/220px-Passengerpigeon.jpg
