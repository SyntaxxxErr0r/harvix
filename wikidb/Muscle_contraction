51.9	Muscle_contraction	Muscle contraction	Muscle fiber generates tension through the action of actin and myosin cross-bridge cycling. While under tension, the muscle may lengthen, shorten, or remain the same. Although the term contraction implies shortening, when referring to the muscular system, it means muscle fibers generating tension with the help of motor neurons (the terms twitch tension, twitch force, and fiber contraction are also used).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Skeletal_muscle.jpg/220px-Skeletal_muscle.jpg
