It has many functions, including recording biographical data for all students, handling admissions, discharges, and transfers to other schools, and recording other student-specific data, such as exam scores, grade levels, attendance, and immunization records. It also provides aggregate student and human resources data to school administrators.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/Automate_the_schools.jpg/200px-Automate_the_schools.jpg
