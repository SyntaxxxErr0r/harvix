1.11	K._A._Thangavelu	K. A. Thangavelu	K. A. Thangavelu (Tamil:டணால் கே.எ தங்கவேலு) popularly known as "Danaal Thangavelu" was a Tamil film comedian popular in the 1950s to 1970s. Not known for physical, acrobatic comedy like his contemporaries J.P.Chandrababu and Nagesh, Thangavelu's humor is recognized for his impeccable timing in verbal agility and the characteristic twang of his delivery. He and M. Saroja formed a successful comedy pair, and his role as a phony writer Bhairavan in the movie Kalyana Parisu was much appreciated by Tamil movie fans. Thangavelu's humor enriched movies such as Thillana Mohanambal in his role as a nattuvangam master (dance choreographer) to the heroine. He died on September 28, 1994.
