56.6	Cruciferous_vegetables	Cruciferous vegetables	Vegetables of the family Brassicaceae (also called Cruciferae) are called cruciferous vegetables. The vegetables are widely cultivated, with many genera, species, and cultivars being raised for food production such as cauliflower, cabbage, cress, bok choy, broccoli and similar green leaf vegetables. The family takes its alternate name (Cruciferae, New Latin for "cross-bearing") from the shape of their flowers, whose four petals resemble a cross.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Cabbage.jpg/220px-Cabbage.jpg
