152.6	Matryoshka_doll	Matryoshka doll	Matryoshka doll (aka Russian nest-ing/ed doll) (Russian: ) refers to a set of wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside the other. The first Russian nested doll set was carved in 1890 by Vasily Zvyozdochkin from a design by Sergey Malyutin, who was a folk crafts painter at Abramtsevo. Traditionally the outer layer is a woman, dressed in a sarafan, a long and shapeless traditional Russian peasant jumper dress. The figures inside may be of either gender; the smallest, innermost doll is typically a baby lathed from a single piece of wood. Much of the artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be very elaborate. The dolls often follow a theme, aside from the typical traditional peasant girls, the themes vary, from fairy tale characters to Soviet leaders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Russian-Matroshka.jpg/220px-Russian-Matroshka.jpg
