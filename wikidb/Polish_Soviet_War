6.00	Polish_Soviet_War	Polish–Soviet War	The Polish–Soviet War (February 1919 – March 1921) was an armed conflict between Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine and the Second Polish Republic and the Ukrainian People's Republic—four states in post–World War I Europe. Poland, whose statehood had just been re-established by the Treaty of Versailles following the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, sought to secure territories it had lost at the time of partitions; the Soviet states aimed to control those same territories, which had been part of the Russian Empire until the turbulent events of World War I. On the Soviet part, the ideological factor was also important, as the newly created communist state sought to spread its revolution to Central, and later Western Europe. This is evident by Marshal Tukhachevsky's daily order to his troops: "Over the corpse of Poland leads the road to the world's fire. Towards Wilno, Minsk, Warsaw go!" Despite the final retreat of Russian forces and annihilation of their three field armies, historians don't universally agree on the question of victory.N 1 The Poles claimed a successful defense of their state, while the Soviets claimed a repulse of the Polish eastward invasion of Ukraine and Belarus, which they viewed as a part of the foreign intervention in the Russian Civil War.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Polish-soviet_war_1920_Polish_defences_near_Milosna%2C_August.jpg/300px-Polish-soviet_war_1920_Polish_defences_near_Milosna%2C_August.jpg
