See also harpsichord concerto; some of these works are occasionally played on piano. Joseph Haydn and Thomas Arne wrote concertos for fortepiano or harpsichord, at the period of time when they were in common usage (the late 18th century).Piano concertos were also somewhat common in the time of Bach and Handel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Concerto_on_stage.jpg/310px-Concerto_on_stage.jpg
