45.70	Directive_(European_Union)	Directive (European Union)	A directive is a legislative act of the European Union, which requires member states to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result. It can be distinguished from regulations which are self-executing and do not require any implementing measures. Directives normally leave member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted. Directives can be adopted by means of a variety of legislative procedures depending on their subject matter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Eurozone.svg/100px-Eurozone.svg.png
