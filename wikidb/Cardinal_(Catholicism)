77.1	Cardinal_(Catholicism)	Cardinal (Catholicism)	A cardinal is a senior ecclesiastical official, usually an ordained bishop, and ecclesiastical prince of the Catholic Church. They are collectively known as the College of Cardinals, which as a body elects a new pope. The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the pope if he requests their counsel. Most cardinals have additional duties, such as leading a diocese or archdiocese or running a department of the Roman Curia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/CardinalCoA_PioM.svg/180px-CardinalCoA_PioM.svg.png
