2.00	Mongol_raids	Mongol military tactics and organization	Genghis Khan organized the Mongol soldiers into groups based on the decimal system. Units, which included all males from 14-60, were recursively built from groups of 10 (Arav), 100 (Zuut), 1,000 (Minghan), and 10,000 , each with a leader reporting to the next higher level. These units were overseen by the tumen quartermaster, called the jurtchi.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/MongolCavalry_crop.jpg/220px-MongolCavalry_crop.jpg
