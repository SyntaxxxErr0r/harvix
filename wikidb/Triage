80.8	Triage	Triage	Triage ( (UK English) or (US English)) is the process of determining the priority of patients' treatments based on the severity of their condition. This rations patient treatment efficiently when resources are insufficient for all to be treated immediately. The term comes from the French verb trier, meaning to separate, sift or select. Two types of triage exist: simple and advanced. Triage may result in determining the order and priority of emergency treatment, the order and priority of emergency transport, or the transport destination for the patient.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Deconference-2002-triage-tag.jpg/200px-Deconference-2002-triage-tag.jpg
