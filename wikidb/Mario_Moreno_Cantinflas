1.00	Mario_Moreno_Cantinflas	Cantinflas	Fortino Mario Alfonso Moreno Reyes (August 12, 1911 â€“ April 20, 1993), was a Mexican comic film actor, producer, and screenwriter known professionally as Cantinflas. He often portrayed impoverished campesinos or a peasant of pelado origin. The character came to be associated with the national identity of Mexico, and allowed Cantinflas to establish a long, successful film career that included a foray into Hollywood. Charlie Chaplin once commented that he was the best comedian alive, and Moreno has been referred to as the "Charlie Chaplin of Mexico". To audiences in the United States, he is best remembered as co-starring with David Niven in a Golden Globe Award-winning role in the 1956 film Around the World in 80 Days.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Mario_Moreno_-_Cantinflas.jpg/220px-Mario_Moreno_-_Cantinflas.jpg
