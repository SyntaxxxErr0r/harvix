59.7	The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog	The Scorpion and the Frog	The origin and author are unknown. Variations of the fable appear in West African and European folktales. The story is often identified with Aesop's Fables, although only variants appear therein. A study published in a German journal in 2011 points out a connection between the genesis of the fable and the tradition of the Panchatantra, a collection of animal fables dating back to India in the 3rd century BCE. Whereas the original Sanskrit work and its early translations do not contain any fable resembling The Scorpion and the Frog, an earlier version of it, The Scorpion and the Turtle, is to be found as an interpolated fable in Islamic variants of the Panchatantra. The study suggests that the interpolation occurred between the 12th and 13th century in the Persian language area and offers a constructive frame of orientation for further research on the question of the fable's origin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Tortoise_and_Scorpion.jpg/220px-Tortoise_and_Scorpion.jpg
