2.10	Imperial_purple	Tyrian purple	Tyrian purple (Greek, , porphyra, Latin: ), also known as royal purple, imperial purple or imperial dye, is a purple-red natural dye, which is extracted from sea snails, and which was possibly first produced by the ancient Phoenicians. This dye was greatly prized in antiquity because it did not fade but became more intense with weathering and sunlight.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Haustellum_brandaris_000.jpg/200px-Haustellum_brandaris_000.jpg
