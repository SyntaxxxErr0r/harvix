94.1	Boron	Boron	Boron ( ) is the chemical element with atomic number 5 and the chemical symbol B. The atomic mass is 10.81. Boron is a metalloid. Because boron is produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in both the solar system and the Earth's crust. However, boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporate ores, such as borax and kernite.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Boron_mNACTEC.jpg/250px-Boron_mNACTEC.jpg
