84.0	Krav_Maga	Krav Maga	Krav Maga (Hebrew: â€Ž , lit. "contact combat") is a noncompetitive eclectic self-defense system developed in Israel that involves striking techniques, wrestling and grappling. Krav Maga is known for its focus on real-world situations and extremely efficient, brutal counter-attacks. It was derived from street-fighting skills developed by Imi Lichtenfeld, who made use of his training as a boxer and wrestler, as a means of defending the Jewish quarter against fascist groups in Bratislava in the mid-to-late 1930s. In the late-1940s, following his immigration to Israel, he began to provide lessons on combat training to what was to become the IDF, who went on to develop the system that became known as Krav Maga. It has since been refined for civilian, police and military applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d3/Krav_Maga_logo.jpg/200px-Krav_Maga_logo.jpg
