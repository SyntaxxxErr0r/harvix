85.1	X-ray_crystallography	X-ray crystallography	X-ray crystallography is a method of determining the arrangement of atoms within a crystal, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a crystal and causes the beam of light to spread into many specific directions. From the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, as well as their chemical bonds, their disorder and various other information.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Zeolite-ZSM-5-3D-vdW.png/220px-Zeolite-ZSM-5-3D-vdW.png
