4.00	Pendentives	Pendentive	A pendentive is a constructive device permitting the placing of a circular dome over a square room or an elliptical dome over a rectangular room. The pendentives, which are triangular segments of a sphere, taper to points at the bottom and spread at the top to establish the continuous circular or elliptical base needed for the dome. In masonry the pendentives thus receive the weight of the dome, concentrating it at the four corners where it can be received by the piers beneath.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Pendentive_and_Dome.png/220px-Pendentive_and_Dome.png
