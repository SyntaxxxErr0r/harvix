52.4	Bandung	Bandung	Bandung (Indonesian: ) is the capital of West Java province in Indonesia, and the country's third largest city, and second largest metropolitan area in Indonesia with a population of 7.4 million in 2007. Located 768 meters (2,520 ft) above sea level, approximately 140 km south eastern of Jakarta, Bandung has cooler temperatures all year-round than most other Indonesian cities. The city lies on a river basin surrounded by volcanic mountains. This topography provides a good natural defense system, which was the primary reason for the Dutch East Indies government's plan to move the colony capital from Batavia to Bandung.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Bandung_Pasupati_Skyline.jpg/300px-Bandung_Pasupati_Skyline.jpg
