62.5	Snoopy	Snoopy	Snoopy Brown is a fictional character in the long-running comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. He is Charlie Brown's pet dog. Snoopy began his life in the strip as a fairly conventional dog, but eventually evolved into perhaps the strip's most dynamic characterâ€”and among the most recognizable comic characters in the world. The original drawings of Snoopy were "greatly patterned" after Spike, one of Schulz's childhood dogs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cc/Snoopy_wwi_ace_lb.jpg
