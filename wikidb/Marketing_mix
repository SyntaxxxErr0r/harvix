113.3	Marketing_mix	Marketing mix	The marketing mix is a business tool used in marketing products. The marketing mix is often crucial when determining a product or brand's unique selling point (the unique quality that differentiates a product from its competitors), and is often synonymous with the 'four Ps': 'price', 'product', 'promotion', and 'place'. However, in recent times, the 'four Ps' have been expanded to the 'seven Ps' with the addition of 'process', 'physical evidence' and 'people'. Recently, 'four Cs' theory is also in the limelight.
