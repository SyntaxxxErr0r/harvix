55.7	Cinematography	Cinematography	Cinematography (from Greek: "movement" and graphein - γράφειν "to record") is the creation of motion picture images. It can involve the use of film or digital imagery, usually with a movie camera. It is closely related to the art of still photography. Many additional technical difficulties and creative possibilities arise when the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/68/Citizen_Kane_deep_focus.jpg/220px-Citizen_Kane_deep_focus.jpg
