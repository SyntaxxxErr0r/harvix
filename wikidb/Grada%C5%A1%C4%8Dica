1.10	Grada%C5%A1%C4%8Dica	Gradaščica	The Gradaščica is a river in Slovenia. The river is 33 kilometres (21 mi) long. It begins in Polhov Gradec at the confluence of Little Creek (Slovene: ) and Big Božna Creek. Near Vrhovci it is joined by Horjulščica Creek (a.k.a. Horjulka Creek). Not far past Bokalce, most of the stream is split off into the Mali Graben Canal and the rest continues as the Gradaščica (also known as the Mestna Gradaščica 'Town Gradaščica'). This continues through the Vrhovci neighborhood into the Vič district, where it is joined by Glinščica Creek, before continuing into the Trnovo district and emptying into the Ljubljanica.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Gradascica_Creek.jpg/288px-Gradascica_Creek.jpg
