153.5	Sgt._Pepper's_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band	Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band	Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (often shortened to Sgt. Pepper) is the eighth studio album by the English rock band The Beatles, released on 1 June 1967 on the Parlophone label and produced by George Martin. The album is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time, and has since been recognised as one of the most important albums in the history of popular music, including songs such as "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" and "A Day in the Life". Recorded over a 129-day period beginning in December 1966, Sgt. Pepper saw the band developing the production techniques of their previous album, Revolver. Martin's innovative and lavish production included the orchestra usage and hired musicians ordered by the band. Genres such as music hall, rock and roll, pop rock, and traditional Indian music are covered. The album cover art, by English pop artist Peter Blake, depicts the band posing in front of a collage of their favourite celebrities, and has been widely acclaimed and imitated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band.jpg/220px-Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band.jpg
