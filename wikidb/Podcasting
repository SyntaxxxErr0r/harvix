775.3	Podcasting	Podcast	A podcast is a type of digital media consisting of an episodic series of files (either audio or video) subscribed to and downloaded through web syndication. The word is a neologism derived from "broadcast" and "pod" from the success of the iPod, as podcasts are often listened to on portable media players.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/Feed-icon.svg/128px-Feed-icon.svg.png
