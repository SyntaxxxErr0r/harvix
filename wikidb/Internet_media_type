80.2	Internet_media_type	Internet media type	An Internet media type is a two-part identifier for file formats on the Internet. The identifiers were originally defined in RFC 2046 for use in email sent through SMTP, but their use has expanded to other protocols such as HTTP, RTP and SIP. These types were originally called MIME types, after MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), and are sometimes referred to as Content-types, after the name of a header in several protocols whose value is such a type.
