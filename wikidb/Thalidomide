114.3	Thalidomide	Thalidomide	Thalidomide ( ) is a sedative drug introduced in the late 1950s that was used to treat morning sickness. It was sold from 1957 until 1961, when it was withdrawn after being found to be a cause of birth defects. Modern uses of thalidomide include treating multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone, and erythema nodosum leprosum, with strict controls on its use to prevent birth defects. Research is ongoing in its use to treat other cancers and autoimmune conditions, although its use is controversial; the thalidomide tragedy led to much stricter testing being introduced for drug and pesticide licensing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Thalidomide-2D-skeletal-wavy.svg/200px-Thalidomide-2D-skeletal-wavy.svg.png
