69.9	Fisheye_lens	Fisheye lens	A fisheye lens is an ultrawide-angle lens that produces strong visual distortion intended to create a wide panoramic or hemispherical image. Fisheys lenses achieve extremely wide angles of view by forgoing producing images with straight lines of perspective , opting instead for a special mapping (for example: equisolid angle), which gives images a characteristic convex non-rectilinear appearance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Nikon_1_V1_%2B_Fisheye_FC-E9_01.jpg/250px-Nikon_1_V1_%2B_Fisheye_FC-E9_01.jpg
