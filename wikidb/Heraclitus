115.2	Heraclitus	Heraclitus	Heraclitus of Ephesus (Greek: —; c. 535 – c. 475 BCE) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, a native of the Greek city Ephesus, Ionia, on the coast of Asia Minor. He was of distinguished parentage. Little is known about his early life and education, but he regarded himself as self-taught and a pioneer of wisdom. From the lonely life he led, and still more from the riddling nature of his philosophy and his contempt for humankind in general, he was called "The Obscure" and the "Weeping Philosopher".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Heraclitus%2C_Johannes_Moreelse.jpg/220px-Heraclitus%2C_Johannes_Moreelse.jpg
