101.9	Common_Language_Runtime	Common Language Runtime	The Common Language Runtime is the virtual machine component of Microsoft's .NET framework and is responsible for managing the execution of .NET programs. In a process known as just-in-time (JIT) compilation, the CLR compiles the intermediate language code known as Common Intermediate Language (CIL) into the machine instructions that in turn are executed by the computer's CPU. The CLR provides additional services including memory management, type safety and exception handling. All programs written for the .NET framework, regardless of programming language, are executed by the CLR. It provides exception handling, Garbage collection and thread management.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/CLR_diag.svg/400px-CLR_diag.svg.png
