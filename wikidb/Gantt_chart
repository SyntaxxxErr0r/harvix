194.7	Gantt_chart	Gantt chart	A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, developed by Henry Gantt, that illustrates a project schedule. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements comprise the work breakdown structure of the project. Some Gantt charts also show the dependency (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current schedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical "TODAY" line as shown here.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/GanttChartAnatomy.svg/300px-GanttChartAnatomy.svg.png
