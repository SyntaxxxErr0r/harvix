13.60	Nilo-Saharan	Nilo-Saharan languages	The Nilo-Saharan languages are a proposed family of African languages spoken by some 50 million people, mainly in the upper parts of the Chari and Nile rivers (hence the term "Nilo-"), including historic Nubia, north of where the two tributaries of Nile meet. The languages extend through 17 nations in the northern half of Africa: from Mali in the west; to Benin, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the south; and Sudan to Tanzania in the east.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Nilo-Saharan.png/350px-Nilo-Saharan.png
