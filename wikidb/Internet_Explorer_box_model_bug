71.1	Internet_Explorer_box_model_bug	Internet Explorer box model bug	The Internet Explorer box model bug refers to the way in which earlier versions of Internet Explorer handle the sizing of elements in a web page, which differs from the standard way recommended by the W3C for the Cascading Style Sheets language. As of Internet Explorer 6, the browser supports an alternative rendering mode (called the "standards-compliant mode") which solves this discrepancy. However, for backward compatibility reasons, all versions still behave in the usual, non-standard way by default (see quirks mode). Internet Explorer for Mac is not affected by this non-standard behavior.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/W3C_and_Internet_Explorer_box_models.svg/300px-W3C_and_Internet_Explorer_box_models.svg.png
