1.00	Volga_Deutsche	Volga Germans	The Volga Germans were ethnic Germans living along the River Volga in the region of southern European Russia around Saratov and to the south. Recruited as immigrants to Russia in the 18th century, they were allowed to maintain German culture, language, traditions and churches: Lutherans, Reformed, Roman Catholics, and Mennonites (Russian Mennonites). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many Volga Germans emigrated to the Midwestern United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and other countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Bundesarchiv_Bild_137-037542%2C_Westpreu%C3%9Fen%2C_Russlanddeutsche_Fl%C3%BCchtlinge.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_137-037542%2C_Westpreu%C3%9Fen%2C_Russlanddeutsche_Fl%C3%BCchtlinge.jpg
