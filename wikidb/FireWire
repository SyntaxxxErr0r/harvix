98.2	FireWire	IEEE 1394	The IEEE 1394 interface, developed in late 1980s and early 1990s by Apple as FireWire, is a serial bus interface standard for high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data transfer. The 1394 interface is comparable with USB and often those two technologies are considered together, though USB has more market share. Apple first included FireWire in some of its 1999 models, and most Apple computers since the year 2000 have included FireWire ports, though, as of 2012, nothing beyond the 800 version (IEEE-1394b). The interface is also known by the brand i.LINK , and Lynx (Texas Instruments). IEEE 1394 replaced parallel SCSI in many applications, because of lower implementation costs and a simplified, more adaptable cabling system. The 1394 standard also defines a backplane interface, though this is not as widely used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/FireWire-46_Diagram.svg/220px-FireWire-46_Diagram.svg.png
