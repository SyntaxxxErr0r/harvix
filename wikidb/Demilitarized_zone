34.74	Demilitarized_zone	Demilitarized zone	In military terms, a demilitarized zone is an area, usually the frontier or boundary between two or more military powers (or alliances), where military activity is not permitted, usually by peace treaty, armistice, or other bilateral or multilateral agreement. Often the demilitarized zone lies upon a line of control and forms a de-facto international border.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/DMZ1.jpg/250px-DMZ1.jpg
