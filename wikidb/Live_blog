1.10	Live_blog	Blog	A blog (a portmanteau of the term web log) is a personal journal published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete entries ("posts") typically displayed in reverse chronological order so the most recent post appears first. Blogs are usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often are themed on a single subject. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Eastcampusfire_glog_crop.png/300px-Eastcampusfire_glog_crop.png
