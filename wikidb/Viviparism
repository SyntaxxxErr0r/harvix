2.00	Viviparism	Vivipary	Viviparous plants produce seeds that germinate before they detach from the parent. In many mangroves, for instance, the seedling germinates and grows under its own energy while still attached to its parent before dropping into the water in order to transport away. In some trees, like Jackfruit, the seeds can be found already germinated while the fruit goes overripe; this condition cannot be said as vivipary since the moist and humid conditions provided by the fruit mimics a wet soil that encourages germination. However, the seeds can germinate under soil too.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Poa_alpina_a2.jpg/220px-Poa_alpina_a2.jpg
