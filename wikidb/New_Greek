1.00	New_Greek	Greek language	Greek ( IPA or , IPA ) is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages. Native to the southern Balkans, it has the longest documented history of any Indo-European language, spanning 34 centuries of written records. Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the majority of its history; other systems, such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary, were previously used. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script, and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Coptic, and many other writing systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Proto_Greek_Area_reconstruction.png/235px-Proto_Greek_Area_reconstruction.png
