69.6	Winemaking	Winemaking	Winemaking, or vinification, is the production of wine, starting with selection of the grapes or other produce and ending with bottling the finished wine. Although most wine is made from grapes, it may also be made from other fruit or non-toxic plant material. Mead is a wine that is made with honey being the primary ingredient after water.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Grapes.jpg/300px-Grapes.jpg
