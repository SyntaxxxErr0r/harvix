12.00	Serve_and_volley	Serve and volley	Serve and volley is a style of play in tennis where the player serving moves quickly towards the net after hitting a serve. The server then attempts to hit a volley (a shot where the ball is struck without allowing it to bounce), as opposed to the baseline style, where the server would stay back following the serve and attempt to hit a groundstroke (a shot where the ball is allowed to bounce before contact is made).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Tennis_Racket_and_Balls.jpg/170px-Tennis_Racket_and_Balls.jpg
