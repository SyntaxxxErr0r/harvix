51.9	Bariatric_surgery	Bariatric surgery	Bariatric surgery (weight-loss surgery) includes a variety of procedures performed on people who are obese. Weight loss is achieved by reducing the size of the stomach with an implanted medical device or through removal of a portion of the stomach (sleeve gastrectomy or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch) or by resecting and re-routing the small intestines to a small stomach pouch (gastric bypass surgery).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Biliopancreatic_diversion.png/220px-Biliopancreatic_diversion.png
