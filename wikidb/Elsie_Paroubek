1.00	Elsie_Paroubek	Elsie Paroubek	Elsie Paroubek (1906â€“1911) was a Czech-American girl who was the victim of kidnapping and murder in the spring of 1911. Her disappearance and the subsequent search for her preoccupied Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota law enforcement for six weeks, and her funeral was attended by between 2,000 and 3,000 people. Miss Paroubek's story, and especially her photograph in the Chicago Daily News, were two of the main inspirations for Henry Darger's immense fantasy novel The Story of the Vivian Girls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Elsie_-_lg.jpg/200px-Elsie_-_lg.jpg
