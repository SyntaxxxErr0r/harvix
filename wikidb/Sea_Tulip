1.00	Sea_Tulip	Pyura spinifera	Sea tulips, scientific name Pyura spinifera, are sessile ascidians that live in coastal waters at depths of up to 80 m (260 feet). Like all ascidians, sea tulips are filter feeders. Their common name comes from their appearance - that of a knobbly 'bulb' or flower attached to a long stalk. Sea tulips come in a variety of colours, including white, pink, yellow, orange, and purple. The coloration of sea tulips depends upon their association with a symbiotic sponge that covers their surface.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Pyura_spinifera.jpg/250px-Pyura_spinifera.jpg
