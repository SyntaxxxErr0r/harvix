1.00	Fretwell_Park	Fretwell Park	Fretwell Park is a cricket ground in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. The ground held a first-class match in 2006 when New Zealand Whites played Pakistan A as part of the 2006 Top End series. The match was abandoned due to rain, as a result it was decided to replace the match with two List A games between the sides. Soccer is also played on the ground.
