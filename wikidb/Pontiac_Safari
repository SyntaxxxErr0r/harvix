3.20	Pontiac_Safari	Pontiac Safari	Safari was a name first applied to Pontiac's version of the 2-door Nomad station wagon. The body style, originally exhibited as a 1954 Chevrolet Corvette Motorama concept car, was shifted to Chevrolet and Pontiac full-size 1955 production vehicles because of the perceived greater sales potential.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/%2764_Pontiac_Safari_%28Cruisin%27_At_The_Boardwalk_%2711%29.jpg/250px-%2764_Pontiac_Safari_%28Cruisin%27_At_The_Boardwalk_%2711%29.jpg
