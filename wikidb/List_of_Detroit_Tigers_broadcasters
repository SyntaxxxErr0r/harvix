1.00	List_of_Detroit_Tigers_broadcasters	List of Detroit Tigers broadcasters	The current flagship radio stations for the Detroit Tigers are WXYT, at 1270 AM, and WXYT-FM, at 97.1, both sports stations. Dan Dickerson (play-by-play) and former Tiger catcher Jim Price (analyst) are the radio announcers; both double as pre-game and post-game show hosts. The games are simulcast on both stations unless there is a conflict with Detroit Red Wings hockey or Detroit Lions football.
