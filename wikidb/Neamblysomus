1.10	Neamblysomus	Golden mole	Golden moles are small, insectivorous burrowing mammals native to southern Africa. They form the family Chrysochloridae, and are taxonomically distinct from the true moles which they resemble due to convergence. The golden moles bear a remarkable resemblance to the marsupial moles of Australia, so much so that, the marsupial/placental divide notwithstanding, arguments were once made that they were related, possibly because they are very primitive placentals and because of the many mole-like specializations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Taupe_doree.jpg/220px-Taupe_doree.jpg
