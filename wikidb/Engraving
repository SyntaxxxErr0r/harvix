57.1	Engraving	Engraving	Engraving is the practice of incising a design on to a hard, usually flat surface, by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an intaglio printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called engravings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Engraving.jpg/220px-Engraving.jpg
