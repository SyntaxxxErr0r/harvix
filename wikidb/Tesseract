88.9	Tesseract	Tesseract	In geometry, the tesseract, also called an 8-cell or regular octachoron or cubic prism, is the four-dimensional analog of the cube. The tesseract is to the cube as the cube is to the square. Just as the surface of the cube consists of 6 square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of 8 cubical cells. The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Schlegel_wireframe_8-cell.png/240px-Schlegel_wireframe_8-cell.png
