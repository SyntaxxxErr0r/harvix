2.00	Abbotsford,_West_Sussex	Abbotsford, West Sussex	Abbotsford is a settlement in West Sussex, England. Although once of a distinct identity, the name is now rarely used to describe the area and it would more likely be described as the outskirts of Burgess Hill. However, the name still exists in the form of a farm (Little Abbotsford) and on OS maps of the area. Until recently a special school located here was known as Abbotsford School, but has since been renamed as The Bridge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/West_Sussex_UK_location_map.svg/240px-West_Sussex_UK_location_map.svg.png
