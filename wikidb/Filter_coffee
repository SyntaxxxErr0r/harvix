2.00	Filter_coffee	Drip brew	Drip brewing, or filtered coffee, is a method for brewing coffee which involves pouring water over roasted, ground coffee beans contained in a filter. Water seeps through the coffee, absorbing its oils and essences, solely under gravity, then passes through the bottom of the filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter with the liquid falling (dripping) into a collecting vessel such as a carafe or pot.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Kaffeefilter.jpg/220px-Kaffeefilter.jpg
