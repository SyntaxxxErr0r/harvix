70.4	MOX_fuel	MOX fuel	Mixed oxide fuel, commonly referred to as MOX fuel, is nuclear fuel that contains more than one oxide of fissile material. MOX fuel contains plutonium blended with natural uranium, reprocessed uranium, or depleted uranium. MOX fuel is an alternative to the low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel used in the light water reactors that predominate nuclear power generation. For example, a mixture of 7% plutonium and 93% natural uranium reacts similarly, although not identically, to LEU fuel.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/SEMofusedMOX.jpg/340px-SEMofusedMOX.jpg
