78.7	Lithium_ion_battery	Lithium-ion battery	A lithium-ion battery (sometimes Li-ion battery or LIB) is a family of rechargeable battery types in which lithium ions move from the negative electrode to the positive electrode during discharge, and back when charging. Chemistry, performance, cost, and safety characteristics vary across LIB types. Unlike lithium primary batteries (which are disposable), lithium-ion electrochemical cells use an intercalated lithium compound as the electrode material instead of metallic lithium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Nokia_Battery.jpg/200px-Nokia_Battery.jpg
