1.00	City_academies	Academy (English school)	In the education system of England, an academy is a school that is directly funded by central government (specifically, the Department for Education) and independent of control by local government in England. An academy may receive additional support from personal or corporate sponsors, either financially or in kind. They must meet the National Curriculum core subject requirements and are subject to inspection by Ofsted. Academies are self-governing and most are constituted as registered charities or operated by other educational charities. Most are secondary schools, i.e. for pupils aged 11 to 16, but some cater for children from nursery age upwards, i.e. for children aged 4 and upwards. All academies have a curriculum specialism within the English Specialist Schools Programme (SSP).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Mossbourne_community_academy_1.jpg/220px-Mossbourne_community_academy_1.jpg
