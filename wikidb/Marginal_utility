56.0	Marginal_utility	Marginal utility	Different concepts of utility underlie different theories in which marginal utility plays a role. It has been common among economists to describe utility as if it were quantifiable, that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale. This has significantly affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Concepts of utility that entail quantification allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/AdamSmith.jpg/105px-AdamSmith.jpg
