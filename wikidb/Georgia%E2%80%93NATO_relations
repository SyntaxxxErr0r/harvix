8.02	Georgia%E2%80%93NATO_relations	Georgia–NATO relations	Georgia and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) relations officially began in 1994 when Georgia joined the NATO–run Partnership for Peace. Georgia has moved quickly following the Rose Revolution in 2003 to seek closer ties and eventual membership with NATO. Georgia's powerful northern neighbor, Russia, has opposed the closer ties, including those expressed at the 2008 Bucharest summit where NATO members promised that Georgia would eventually join the organization. In the 7 December 2011 statement of the North Atlantic Council Georgia was designated as an "aspirant country".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Location_NATO_Georgia.svg/300px-Location_NATO_Georgia.svg.png
