145.1	Surveillance	Surveillance	Surveillance ( or ) is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting. Surveillance is therefore an ambiguous practice, sometimes creating positive effects, at other times negative. It is sometimes done in a surreptitious manner. It most usually refers to observation of individuals or groups by government organizations, but disease surveillance, for example, is monitoring the progress of a disease in a community.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Surveillance_quevaal.jpg/250px-Surveillance_quevaal.jpg
