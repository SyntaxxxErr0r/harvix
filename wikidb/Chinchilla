60.4	Chinchilla	Chinchilla	Chinchillas are crepuscular rodents, slightly larger and more robust than ground squirrels, native to the Andes mountains in South America. They live in colonies at high altitudes (up to 15,000 ft/4,270 m). Historically, they lived in the Andes of Bolivia, Chile, and Peru, but today colonies in the wild remain only in Chile. Along with their relatives, viscachas, they make up the family Chinchillidae.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Standardchinchilla.jpg/250px-Standardchinchilla.jpg
