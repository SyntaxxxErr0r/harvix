126.4	No_Country_for_Old_Men_(film)	No Country for Old Men (film)	No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American crime thriller written and directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, and starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin, in an adaptation from the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name. It tells the story of an ordinary man to whom chance delivers a fortune that is not his, and the ensuing cat-and-mouse drama, as three men crisscross each other's paths in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas. Themes of fate, conscience and circumstance re-emerge that the Coen brothers have previously explored in Blood Simple and Fargo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/No_Country_for_Old_Men_poster.jpg/220px-No_Country_for_Old_Men_poster.jpg
