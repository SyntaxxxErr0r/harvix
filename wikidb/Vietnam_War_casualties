55.7	Vietnam_War_casualties	Vietnam War casualties	The Vietnam War began in 1955 and ended in 1975 when North Vietnamese forces conquered Saigon. During this period the war escalated from an insurgency in South Vietnam sponsored by the North Vietnamese government to direct military intervention in the south by North Vietnam, as well as the active participation of military forces of the United States and other countries. The war also spilled over into the neighbouring countries of Cambodia and Laos. An exhaustive reckoning of the total casualties must include statistical information available for each theater of the war. The casualty figures below focus on Vietnam and exclude those in Cambodia and Laos. The Republic of Vietnam (commonly called South Vietnam) was where most of the fighting took place, and it accordingly suffered most from the war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/VietnamCombatArtCAT04JamesPollockWaitingtoLiftOff.jpg/200px-VietnamCombatArtCAT04JamesPollockWaitingtoLiftOff.jpg
