73.0	Anarcho-capitalism	Anarcho-capitalism	Anarcho-capitalism (also referred to as “libertarian anarchy” by anarcho-capitalists, “market anarchism,” “free market anarchism” or “private-property anarchism”) is a libertarian and individualist anarchist political philosophy that advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market. In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts, and all other security services would be provided by voluntarily funded competitors rather than through taxation, and money would be privately and competitively provided in an open market. According to anarcho-capitalists, personal and economic activities would be regulated by privately run law rather than through politics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Anarchy-symbol.svg/125px-Anarchy-symbol.svg.png
