479.8	Augmented_reality	Augmented reality	Augmented reality (AR) is a live, direct or indirect, view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing oneâ€™s current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Wikitude.jpg/220px-Wikitude.jpg
