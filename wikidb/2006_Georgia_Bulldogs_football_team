Despite losses to unranked Kentucky and Vanderbilt, Georgia salvaged its season by beating two ranked teams in the last two games of the season: #5 Auburn and #15 Georgia Tech. A victory over #14 Virginia Tech in the 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl gave the Georgia Bulldogs three consecutive victories over top 25 teams. This was the team's sixth season under the guidance of head coach Mark Richt.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/2006_VT_UGA_Chick_fil_A_action.jpg/280px-2006_VT_UGA_Chick_fil_A_action.jpg
