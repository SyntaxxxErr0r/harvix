66.1	Marcellus_Formation	Marcellus Formation	Marcellus Formation (also classified as the Marcellus Subgroup of the Hamilton Group, Marcellus Member of the Romney Formation, or simply the Marcellus Shale) is a unit of marine sedimentary rock found in eastern North America. Named for a distinctive outcrop near the village of Marcellus, New York in the United States, it extends throughout much of the Appalachian Basin. The shale contains largely untapped natural gas reserves, and its proximity to the high-demand markets along the East Coast of the United States makes it an attractive target for energy development.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/MarcellusShaleBank1.jpg/220px-MarcellusShaleBank1.jpg
