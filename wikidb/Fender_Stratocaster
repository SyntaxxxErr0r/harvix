70.2	Fender_Stratocaster	Fender Stratocaster	The Fender Stratocaster is an electric guitar. Designed by Leo Fender, George Fullerton, and Freddie Tavares in 1954, it has been manufactured continuously by the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation to the present. It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top horn for balance. Along with the Les Paul, it is the most popular electric guitar. Although "Stratocaster" and "Strat" are trademark terms belonging to the Fender, the term "Strat" is often applied to any guitar with the same general features as the original regardless of manufacturer.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/FiestaRedStrat.jpg/250px-FiestaRedStrat.jpg
