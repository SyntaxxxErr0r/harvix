228.2	Bible	Bible	The Bible (from Koine Greek ta biblia "the books") is any one of the collections of the primary religious texts of Judaism and Christianity. There is no common version of the Bible, as the contents and the order of the individual books vary among denominations. The 24 texts of the Hebrew Bible are divided into 39 books in Christian Old Testaments, and complete Christian Bibles range from the 66 books of the Protestant canon to the 81 books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church Bible. The Hebrew and Christian Bibles are also important to other Abrahamic religions, including Islam and the Bahá'í Faith, but those religions do not regard them as central religious texts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Gutenberg_Bible.jpg/340px-Gutenberg_Bible.jpg
