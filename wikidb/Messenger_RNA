55.6	Messenger_RNA	Messenger RNA	Messenger RNA is a molecule of RNA that encodes a chemical "blueprint" for a protein product. mRNA is transcribed from a DNA template, and carries coding information to the sites of protein synthesis, the ribosomes. In the ribosomes, the mRNA is translated into a polymer of amino acids: a protein. (This process is sometimes referred to as the central dogma of molecular biology.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/MRNA-interaction.png/300px-MRNA-interaction.png
