144.8	Salvia_divinorum	Salvia divinorum	Salvia divinorum (also known as Diviner's Sage, Ska Mar√≠a Pastora, Seer's Sage, and by its genus name Salvia) is a psychoactive plant which can induce dissociative effects and is a potent producer of "visions" and other hallucinatory experiences. Its native habitat is within cloud forest in the isolated Sierra Mazateca of Oaxaca, Mexico, where it grows in shady and moist locations. The plant grows to over a meter high, has hollow square stems, large leaves, and occasional white flowers with violet calyxes. Botanists have not determined whether Salvia divinorum is a cultigen or a hybrid; native plants reproduce vegetatively, rarely producing viable seed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Salvia_divinorum_-_Herba_de_Maria.jpg/220px-Salvia_divinorum_-_Herba_de_Maria.jpg
