This dictionary is not based on the Oxford English Dictionary and should not be mistaken for a new or updated version of the OED. It is a completely new dictionary which strives to represent as faithfully as possible the current usage of English words.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/NewOED-2001-ed.jpg/275px-NewOED-2001-ed.jpg
