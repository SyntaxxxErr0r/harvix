147.9	Central_Europe	Central Europe	Central Europe or alternatively Middle Europe is a region of the European continent lying between the variously defined areas of Eastern and Western Europe. The term and widespread interest in the region itself came back into fashion by the end of the Cold War, which had divided Europe politically into East and West, splitting Central Europe in half.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/CentralEurope.png/325px-CentralEurope.png
