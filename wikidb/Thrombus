54.6	Thrombus	Thrombus	A thrombus (Greek: ), or blood clot, is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis. It is achieved via the aggregation of platelets that form a platelet plug, and the activation of the humoral coagulation system (i.e. clotting factors). A thrombus is normal in cases of injury, but pathologic in instances of thrombosis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Fetal_thrombotic_vasculopathy_-_very_high_mag.jpg/220px-Fetal_thrombotic_vasculopathy_-_very_high_mag.jpg
