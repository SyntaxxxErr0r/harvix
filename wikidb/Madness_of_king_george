It tells the true story of George III's deteriorating mental health, and his equally declining relationship with his son, the Prince of Wales, particularly focusing on the period around the Regency Crisis of 1788. Modern medicine has suggested the King's symptoms were the result of acute intermittent porphyria.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/Madness_of_king_george-715444.jpeg/220px-Madness_of_king_george-715444.jpeg
