It ran from the early 15th century to a point in the early 18th century when the Mughal Emperors' power had dwindled. It ended in several generations of conflicts between rival warlords.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Flag_of_the_Mughal_Empire.svg/140px-Flag_of_the_Mughal_Empire.svg.png
