50.9	Candombl%C3%A9	Candomblé	Candomblé is an African-originated or Afro-Brazilian religion, practiced chiefly in Brazil by the "povo de santo" (saint people). It originated in the cities of Salvador, the capital of Bahia and Cachoeira, at the time one of the main commercial crossroads for the distribution of products and slave trade to other parts of Bahia state in Brazil. Although Candomblé is practiced primarily in Brazil, it is also practiced in other countries in the Americas, including Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama; and in Europe in Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The religion is based in the anima (soul) of Nature, and is also known as Animism. It was developed in Brazil with the knowledge of African Priests that were enslaved and brought to Brazil, together with their mythology, their culture and language, between 1549 and 1888.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Casa_branca_engenho_velho.jpg/200px-Casa_branca_engenho_velho.jpg
