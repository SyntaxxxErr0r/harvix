1.01	Eliksir	Eliksir	Eliksir is the second studio album by Norwegian Hard rock band Skambankt. The first single "Tyster" received a decent amount of radio airplay, and it entered the Norwegian album charts on 8th place the week after its release. A video was made to promote the record's second single "Dynasti". The "Intro", which is the main riff of "Nok et Offer" played on church bells, was played on the bells of the clocktower of Oslo RÃ¥dhus in Oslo and recorded. "Nok et Offer" originally appeared on the Skamania EP, but was re-recorded for this album. The track "Siste Stikk" was recorded in the independent studio Suksesslaboratoriet rather than the Propeller Music Division Studio.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/08/Skambankt_Eliksir_Cover.jpg/220px-Skambankt_Eliksir_Cover.jpg
