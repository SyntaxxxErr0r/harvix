He was immensely popular with the reading public and wrote a stream of bestselling dime-novels which earned him a considerable fortune. He coined several phrases that would become clichés, especially "the great unwashed", "pursuit of the almighty dollar", "the pen is mightier than the sword", as well as the famous opening line "It was a dark and stormy night".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Edward_George_Earle_Lytton_Bulwer_Lytton%2C_1st_Baron_Lytton_by_Henry_William_Pickersgill.jpg/200px-Edward_George_Earle_Lytton_Bulwer_Lytton%2C_1st_Baron_Lytton_by_Henry_William_Pickersgill.jpg
