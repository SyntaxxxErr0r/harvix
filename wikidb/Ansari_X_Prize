87.1	Ansari_X_Prize	Ansari X Prize	The Ansari X Prize was a space competition in which the X Prize Foundation offered a US$10,000,000 prize for the first non-government organization to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. It was modeled after early 20th-century aviation prizes, and aimed to spur development of low-cost spaceflight.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Spaceship_One_in_flight_1.jpg/220px-Spaceship_One_in_flight_1.jpg
