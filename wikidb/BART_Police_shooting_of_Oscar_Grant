Responding to reports of a fight on a crowded Bay Area Rapid Transit train returning from San Francisco, BART Police officers detained Oscar Grant and several other passengers on the platform at the Fruitvale BART Station. Officer Johannes Mehserle and another officer were restraining Grant, who was prostrate and allegedly resisting arrest. Officer Mehserle stood and, according to witnesses, said "Get back, I'm gonna tase him." Then Mehserle drew his gun and shot Grant once in the back; Mehserle appeared stunned, put his hands to his head and exclaimed "Oh my God!" During his court testimony, Mehserle said that Grant then exclaimed, "You shot me!" Grant turned out to be unarmed; he was pronounced dead the next morning at Highland Hospital in Oakland.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4d/Oscargrantkilledbypolice2.JPG/170px-Oscargrantkilledbypolice2.JPG
