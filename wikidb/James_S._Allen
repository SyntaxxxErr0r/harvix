1.00	James_S._Allen	James S. Allen	During his formative years in Philadelphia Auerbach had developed a strong interest in African American life, which lead to his appointment in 1930 as editor of the Communist Party's first newspaper produced south of the Mason-Dixon line â€” The Southern Worker. Auerbach adopted the Party name "James S. Allen" at this time and he traveled to Chattanooga, Tennessee with his wife Isabelle Allen to establish and edit the weekly paper.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Black_belt_counties.png/300px-Black_belt_counties.png
