53.6	British_House_of_Commons	House of Commons of the United Kingdom	The House of Commons is the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which also comprises the Sovereign and the House of Lords (the upper house). Both Commons and Lords meet in the Palace of Westminster. The Commons is a democratically elected body, consisting of 650 members (since the 2010 general election), who are known as Members of Parliament (MPs). Members are elected through the first-past-the-post system by electoral districts known as constituencies. They hold their seats until Parliament is dissolved (a maximum of five years after the preceding election).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Crowned_Portcullis.svg/110px-Crowned_Portcullis.svg.png
