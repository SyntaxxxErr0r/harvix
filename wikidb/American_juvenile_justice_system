3.20	American_juvenile_justice_system	American juvenile justice system	The first juvenile court was established in 1899 in Chicago as a byproduct of the Progressive Era. Before this, anyone under the age of seventeen who committed a crime was placed in the same system as adults. However, by this time, social views had begun to change. With recent discoveries and research by psychologists, many started to see juveniles as youths who had simply lost their way, rather than as hardened criminals. It was believed that with proper structure and disciplinary guidelines instituted, a youth could be rehabilitated and become a productive member of society.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Mary-Margaret-Bartelme-Bain.jpeg/170px-Mary-Margaret-Bartelme-Bain.jpeg
