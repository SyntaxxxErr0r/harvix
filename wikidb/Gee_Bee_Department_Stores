4.00	Gee_Bee_Department_Stores	Gee Bee Department Stores	Gee Bee Department Stores began in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States, in 1906 when the Glosser brothers opened a small one-room shop in the Franklin Building. The chain branched out in the 1960s with the opening of the suburban Gee Bee discount stores. Most of the stores, including the original, which retained the full Glosser name, remained open into the late 1980s- early 1990s. The chain operated 23 stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia at its peak in the 1980s. The Franklin Building was redeveloped in the mid-1990s. The Gee Bee locations were sold off over the years to other chain stores.
