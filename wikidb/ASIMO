60.4	ASIMO	ASIMO	ASIMO Ashimo) is a humanoid robot created by Honda. Introduced in 2000, ASIMO, which is an acronym for "Advanced Step in Innovative MObility", was created to be a helper to people. Apparently the resemblance to the name of Isaac Asimov is merely a coincidence. With aspirations of helping people who lack full mobility, ASIMO is used to encourage young people to study science and mathematics. At 130 cm (4 feet, 3 inches) tall and 54 kg (119 lbs), ASIMO was designed to operate in real-world environments, with the ability to walk or run on two feet at speeds up to 3.7 mph (6km/h). In the USA, ASIMO is part of the Innoventions attraction at Disneyland and has been featured in a 15-minute show called "Say 'Hello' to Honda's ASIMO" since June 2005. The robot has made public appearances around the world, including the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the Miraikan Museum and Honda Collection Hall in Japan and the Ars Electronica festival in Austria.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Asimo_logo.svg/175px-Asimo_logo.svg.png
