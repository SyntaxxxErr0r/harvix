60.1	Prince	Prince	Prince is a general term for a ruler, monarch or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family, and is a hereditary title in the nobility of some European states. The feminine equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word prince, from the Latin noun princeps, from primus(first) + capio (to seize), meaning "the chief, most distinguished, ruler, prince".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Princely_Hat.svg/120px-Princely_Hat.svg.png
