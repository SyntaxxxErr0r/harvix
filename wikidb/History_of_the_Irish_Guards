The current Irish Guards are the second unit to bear this name. The first Irish Guards fought on the Jacobite side at the Battle of the Boyne and went to France as a Stuart regiment in 1692, and the French Army's 92e RÃ©giment d'Infanterie traces its ancestry to this unit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Bearskin.cenotaph.london.arp.jpg/250px-Bearskin.cenotaph.london.arp.jpg
