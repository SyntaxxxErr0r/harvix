65.4	Tocopherol	Tocopherol	The tocotrienols have the same methyl structure at the ring and the same Greek letter-methyl-notation, but differ from the analogous tocopherols by the presence of three double bonds in the hydrophobic side chain. The unsaturation of the tails gives tocotrienols only a single stereoisomeric carbon (and thus two possible isomers per structural formula, one of which occurs naturally), whereas tocopherols have 3 centers (and eight possible stereoisomers per structural formula, again, only one of which occurs naturally).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Tocopherol%2C_alpha-.svg/200px-Tocopherol%2C_alpha-.svg.png
