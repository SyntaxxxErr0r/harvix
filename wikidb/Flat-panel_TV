1.00	Flat-panel_TV	Flat panel display	Flat panel displays (sometimes referred to as flatscreens, which more technically mean screens with fully flat front surfaces) encompass a growing number of electronic visual display technologies. They are far lighter and thinner than traditional television sets and video displays that use cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and are usually less than 10 centimetres (3.9 in) thick. (Some CRTs were designed to have a flat front surface, and equipment using them was advertised as "flat-screen", which can cause confusion.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/TFT_Monitor_Flachbildschirm.jpg/220px-TFT_Monitor_Flachbildschirm.jpg
