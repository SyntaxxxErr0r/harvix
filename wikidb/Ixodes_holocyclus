10.10	Ixodes_holocyclus	Ixodes holocyclus	The paralysis tick of Australia, Ixodes holocyclus, is one of about 75 species of Australian tick fauna and is considered the most medically important. It is usually found in a 20-kilometre wide band following the eastern coastline of Australia. Within this range Ixodes holocyclus is the tick most frequently encountered by humans and their pets. As this area also contains the majority of Australia's most densely populated regions, incidents of bites on people, pets and livestock are relatively common.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Tick_before_and_after_feeding.jpg/220px-Tick_before_and_after_feeding.jpg
