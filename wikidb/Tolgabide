1.30	Tolgabide	Tolgabide	Tolgabide is a drug which was patented by Synth√©labo as an anticonvulsant but was never marketed. It is an analogue of progabide and acts similarly to it as a prodrug of GABA, and therefore as an indirect agonist of the GABA receptors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Tolgabide-ifa.png/220px-Tolgabide-ifa.png
