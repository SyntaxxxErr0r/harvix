6.40	UNTAC	United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia	The United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia was a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia in 1992â€“93. It was also the first occasion on which the UN had taken over the administration of an independent state, organized and run an election (as opposed to monitoring or supervising), had its own radio station and jail, and been responsible for promoting and safeguarding human rights at the national level.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Flag_of_Cambodia_under_UNTAC.svg/125px-Flag_of_Cambodia_under_UNTAC.svg.png
