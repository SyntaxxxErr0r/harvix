62.4	Ferry	Ferry	A ferry (or ferryboat) is a form of transportation, usually a boat, but sometimes a ship, used to carry (or ferry) primarily passengers, and sometimes vehicles and cargo as well, across a body of water. Most ferries operate on regular, frequent, return services. A passenger ferry with many stops, such as in Venice, is sometimes called a water bus or water taxi.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Pride_of_burgundy.jpg/300px-Pride_of_burgundy.jpg
