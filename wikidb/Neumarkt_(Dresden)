The historic area was almost completely wiped out during the Allied bomb attack during the Second World War. After the war Dresden fell under Soviet occupation and later the communist German Democratic Republic who rebuilt the Neumarkt area in socialist realist style and partially with historic buildings. However huge areas and parcels of the place remained untilled. After the fall of Communism and German reunification the decision was made to restore the Neumarkt to its pre-war look.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Frauenkirche-dresden.jpg/300px-Frauenkirche-dresden.jpg
