88.3	Idea	Idea	An idea is a concept or mental impression Very often, ideas are construed as representational images; i.e. images of some object. In other contexts, ideas are taken to be concepts, although abstract concepts do not necessarily appear as images. Many philosophers consider ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Plato-raphael.jpg
