2.00	Norwegian_elk_hound	Norwegian Elkhound	The Norwegian Elkhound is one of the ancient Northern Spitz-type breed of dog and is the National Dog of Norway. The Elkhound has served as a hunter, guardian, herder, and defender. In a land of subzero temperatures, deep snow, thick forests, and rugged mountains, only the hardiest of the breeds could evolve to perform the variety of jobs at which the Elkhound excels. It's known for its courage in tracking and hunting moose and other large game, such as bear or wolf. The Norwegian Elkhound was first presented at a dog exhibition in Norway in 1877.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Norwegian_Elkhound.jpg/220px-Norwegian_Elkhound.jpg
