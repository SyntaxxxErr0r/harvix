1.00	Transmit_Disrupt	Transmit Disrupt	Transmit Disrupt is the second album from Hell Is for Heroes and features 12 tracks. It was released in the United Kingdom in March 2005 while the band wasn't under a record label; consequently the album didn't get a lot of promotion. The singles "Kamichi", "One Of Us", "Discos and Casinos" and "Models for the Programme" were taken from the album. In March 2006 the album was re-released by Burning Heart Records with new artwork and packaging.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/Hellisforheroes-transmitdisrupt.jpg/220px-Hellisforheroes-transmitdisrupt.jpg
