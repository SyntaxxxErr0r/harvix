2.00	Astures	Astures	The Astures (or Asturs) were the Hispano-Celtic Gallaecian inhabitants of the northwest area of Hispania that now comprises almost the entire modern autonomous community of Asturias and the modern provinces León, and northern Zamora (all in Spain), and east of Trás os Montes in Portugal. They were a horse-riding highland cattle-raising people who lived in circular huts of stone drywall construction. The Albiones were a major tribe of the Astures from western Asturias. Isidore of Seville, gave an etymology as coming from a river Asturia, identified by David Magie with the Órbigo in the plain of León, by others the modern Esla.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Torque_galaico-asturiano_de_Labra_%28M.A.N._33132%29_01.jpg/220px-Torque_galaico-asturiano_de_Labra_%28M.A.N._33132%29_01.jpg
