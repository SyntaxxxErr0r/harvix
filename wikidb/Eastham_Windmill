It was constructed by Eastham resident Thomas Paine in Plymouth in 1680. It was first moved to nearby Truro in 1770, then finally to Eastham in 1793. In 1808 the windmill was moved to its present location, near the Eastham Town Hall and the Eastham Public Library. Eastham Windmill, as part of the Eastham Center Historic District, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Eastham_Windmill.jpg/250px-Eastham_Windmill.jpg
