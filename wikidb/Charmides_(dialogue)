15.42	Charmides_(dialogue)	Charmides (dialogue)	The Charmides (Ancient Greek: ) is a dialogue of Plato, in which Socrates engages a handsome and popular boy in a conversation about the meaning of sophrosyne, a Greek word usually translated into English as "temperance", "self-control", or "restraint". As is typical with Platonic early dialogues, the two never arrive at a completely satisfactory definition, but the discussion nevertheless raises many important points.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Plato-raphael.jpg/100px-Plato-raphael.jpg
