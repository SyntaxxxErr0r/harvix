59.9	Arm	Arm	In human anatomy, the arm is the part of the upper limb between the shoulder and the elbow joints. In other animals, the term arm can also be used for analogous structures, such as one of the paired forelimbs of a four-legged animal or the arms of cephalopods. In anatomical usage, the term arm refers specifically to the segment between the shoulder and the elbow, while the segment between the elbow and wrist is the forearm. However, in common, literary, and historical usage, arm refers to the entire upper limb from shoulder to wrist. This article uses the former definition; see upper limb for the wider definition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Upperarm.jpg/250px-Upperarm.jpg
