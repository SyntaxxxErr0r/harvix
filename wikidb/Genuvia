1.00	Genuvia	Sitagliptin	Sitagliptin is an oral antihyperglycemic (antidiabetic drug) of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class. It was developed, and is marketed, by Merck &amp; Co. This enzyme-inhibiting drug is used either alone or in combination with other oral antihyperglycemic agents (such as metformin or a thiazolidinedione) for treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. The benefit of this medicine is its fewer side effects (e.g., less hypoglycemia, less weight gain) in the control of blood glucose values. While safety is its advantage, efficacy is often challenged as it is often recommended to be combined with other agents like metformin. Exenatide (Byetta) also works by its effect on the incretin system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Sitagliptin.svg/254px-Sitagliptin.svg.png
