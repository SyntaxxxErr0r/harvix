1.10	Group_of_22	Group of 22	The Group of 22 (G22 or Willard Group) was announced by the leaders of APEC in 1997. The intention was to convene a number of meetings between finance ministers and central bank governors to make proposals on reform of the global financial system. The Group of 22 comprised members of the G8 and 14 other countries. It first met in 1998 in Washington, D.C. to consider the stability of the international financial system and capital markets. It was superseded first by the Group of 33 in 1999 and then by the Group of 20 (G-20).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/G22_nations.svg/300px-G22_nations.svg.png
