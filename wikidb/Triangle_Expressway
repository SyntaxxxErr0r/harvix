1.00	Triangle_Expressway	Triangle Expressway	The Triangle Expressway is the first modern toll road built in North Carolina, and one of the first toll roads in the United States built to use only electronic toll collection instead of toll booths. The overall freeway consists of two segments called the Triangle Parkway and the Western Wake Freeway. The six-lane Triangle Parkway extends the pre-existing NC 147 3.5 miles (5.6 km) in Durham County to meet NC 540 in Morrisville in Wake County. The Western Wake Freeway is planned to extend the total Triangle Expressway to 18.8 miles (30.3 km) long, extending NC 540 where it continues along to Holly Springs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Triangle_Expressway_Toll_Rate_Sign.jpg/220px-Triangle_Expressway_Toll_Rate_Sign.jpg
