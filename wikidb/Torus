79.9	Torus	Torus	In geometry, a torus (pl. tori) is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three dimensional space about an axis coplanar with the circle. In most contexts it is assumed that the axis does not touch the circle - in this case the surface has a ring shape and is called a ring torus or simply torus if the ring shape is implicit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Torus.png/250px-Torus.png
