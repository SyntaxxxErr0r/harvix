7.61	Samsung_Wave_S8500	Samsung Wave S8500	The Samsung Wave GT-S8500 (or "Samsung Wave") is the first touchscreen smartphone running the Bada Operating System designed by Samsung, which was commercially released on June 1, 2010. The Wave is a slim touchscreen phone powered by Samsung's "Hummingbird" CPU (S5PC110), which includes 1 GHz ARM Cortex-A8 CPU and a built-in PowerVR SGX 540 graphics engine, "Super AMOLED" screen and 720p high-definition video capture capabilities. Due to shortage of Super AMOLED screens, Samsung released a similar version called Wave II and ceased production of the S8500 model.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Samsung_Logo.svg/150px-Samsung_Logo.svg.png
