78.7	Masturbation	Masturbation	Masturbation refers to the sexual stimulation of a person's genitals, usually to the point of orgasm. The stimulation can be performed manually, by use of objects or tools, or by some combination of these methods. Masturbation is a common form of autoeroticism, providing sexual pleasure or orgasm in the absence of a partner. The act, when performed with a partner, is called mutual masturbation and is sometimes used as an alternative to sexual intercourse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Klimt_Mulher_sentada.jpg/220px-Klimt_Mulher_sentada.jpg
