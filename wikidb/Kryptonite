102.7	Kryptonite	Kryptonite	Kryptonite is a fictional material from the Superman mythos —the ore form of a radioactive element from Superman's home planet of Krypton. It is famous for being the ultimate natural weakness of Superman and most other Kryptonians, and the word Kryptonite has since become synonymous with an Achilles' heel —the one weakness of an otherwise invulnerable hero.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/da/Kryptonite.JPG/250px-Kryptonite.JPG
