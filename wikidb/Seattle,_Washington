71.0	Seattle,_Washington	Seattle	The Seattle area had been inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent white settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to its current site and renamed "Seattle" in 1853, after Chief Seattle of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/SeattleMontage.png/250px-SeattleMontage.png
