92.7	Melody	Melody	A melody (from Greek μελῳδία - melōidía, "singing, chanting"), also tune, voice, or line, is a linear succession of musical tones which is perceived as a single entity. In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while, more figuratively, the term has occasionally been extended to include successions of other musical elements such as tone color. It may be considered the foreground to the background accompaniment. A line or part need not be a foreground melody.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/BachFugueBar.png/220px-BachFugueBar.png
