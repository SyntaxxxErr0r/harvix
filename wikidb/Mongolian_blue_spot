It is also extremely prevalent among East Asians, Polynesians, Native Americans, and East Africans. It normally disappears three to five years after birth and almost always by puberty. The most common color is blue, although they can be blue-gray, blue-black or even deep brown.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Mongolianspotphoto.jpg/230px-Mongolianspotphoto.jpg
