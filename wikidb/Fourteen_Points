55.7	Fourteen_Points	Fourteen Points	The Fourteen Points was a speech given by United States President Woodrow Wilson to a joint session of Congress on January 8, 1918. The address was intended to assure the country that the Great War was being fought for a moral cause and for postwar peace in Europe. People in Europe generally welcomed Wilson's intervention, but his Allied colleagues were skeptical of the applicability of Wilsonian idealism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/14Points.jpg/250px-14Points.jpg
