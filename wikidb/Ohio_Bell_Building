1.00	Ohio_Bell_Building	AT&amp;T Huron Road Building	The AT&amp;T Huron Road Building (formally known as the Ohio Bell Building) is an art deco skyscraper located at 750 Huron Road in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. It serves as the corporate headquarters for Ohio Bell, a regional telephone company owned by AT&amp;T. The building has 24 stories and rises to a height of 365 ft (111 m). It was designed by the firm of Hubbell and Benes, in what they called "Modern American Perpendicular Gothic", a style influenced by Eliel Saarinen's unrealized design for the Tribune Tower in Chicago. Work on the building began in 1925 and was completed in 1927 at a cost of $5 million. It was briefly the tallest building in Cleveland, surpassed in 1928 by the Terminal Tower.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/AT%26T_Huron_Rd_building.jpg/300px-AT%26T_Huron_Rd_building.jpg
