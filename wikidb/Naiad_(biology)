1.10	Naiad_(biology)	Nymph (biology)	In biology, a nymph is the immature form of some invertebrates, particularly insects, which undergoes gradual metamorphosis before reaching its adult stage. Unlike a typical larva, a nymph's overall form already resembles that of the adult. In addition, while a nymph moults it never enters a pupal stage. Instead, the final moult results in an adult insect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Common_jassid_nymph_and_ant02.jpg/220px-Common_jassid_nymph_and_ant02.jpg
