4.10	Wybunbury	Wybunbury	The leaning tower of the former church of St Chad, also known as the 'Leaning Tower of South Cheshire' and the 'Hanging Steeple of Wimberie', is located in Wybunbury village. The 29.3 m tower is all that remains of a late fifteenth century church demolished in 1833. (Later churches, replacing the fifteenth century one, were also demolished in 1892 and 1977.) The tower was stabilised using underexcavation by James Trubshaw in 1832; this is the earliest known application of the technique, which was also used to stabilise the Leaning Tower of Pisa.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Wybunbury_tower.jpg/300px-Wybunbury_tower.jpg
