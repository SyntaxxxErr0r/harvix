57.7	Psychiatric_hospital	Psychiatric hospital	Psychiatric hospitals, also known as mental hospitals, are hospitals specializing in the treatment of serious mental disorders. Psychiatric hospitals vary widely in their size and grading. Some hospitals may specialise only in short-term or outpatient therapy for low-risk patients. Others may specialise in the temporary or permanent care of residents who, as a result of a psychological disorder, require routine assistance, treatment, or a specialised and controlled environment. Patients are often admitted on a voluntary basis, but involuntary commitment is practiced when an individual may pose a significant danger to themselves or others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/NorthernMichiganAsylumCTraverseCityMI.JPG/220px-NorthernMichiganAsylumCTraverseCityMI.JPG
