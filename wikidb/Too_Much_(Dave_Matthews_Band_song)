2.10	Too_Much_(Dave_Matthews_Band_song)	Too Much (Dave Matthews Band song)	"Too Much" is a song by Dave Matthews Band. It was the first single off their album Crash, and reached #5 on the Billboard magazine Modern Rock Tracks chart. It is also featured on the Dave Matthews Band compilation album The Best of What's Around Vol. 1. When performed live, the song frequently is preceded by "Anyone Seen the Bridge?", a jam frequently played directly after the song "So Much to Say." From 2004 to 2007 the song included a stop time section after the second verse. An example of this is on the Live At Piedmont Park release. Dave Matthews has also interpolated some of the lyrics from David Bowie's song "Golden Years" into the song. An example of this interpolation is on Live Trax 8.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Too_Much_dmb.jpg/220px-Too_Much_dmb.jpg
