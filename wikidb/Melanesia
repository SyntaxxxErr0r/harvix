55.1	Melanesia	Melanesia	Melanesia is a subregion of Oceania extending from the western end of the Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea, and eastward to Fiji. The region comprises most of the islands immediately north and northeast of Australia. The name Melanesia (from Greek: μέλας black; νῆσος, islands) was first used by Jules Dumont d'Urville in 1832 to denote an ethnic and geographical grouping of islands distinct from Polynesia and Micronesia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Melanesian_Cultural_Area.png/240px-Melanesian_Cultural_Area.png
