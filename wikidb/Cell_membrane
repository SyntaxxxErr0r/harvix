72.6	Cell_membrane	Cell membrane	The cell membrane or plasma membrane is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment. The cell membrane is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells. It basically protects the cell from outside forces. It consists of the lipid bilayer with embedded proteins. Cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion, ion conductivity and cell signaling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures, including the cell wall, glycocalyx, and intracellular cytoskeleton. On December 29, 2011, chemists at Harvard University reported the creation of an artificial cell membrane.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Cell_membrane_detailed_diagram_4.svg/400px-Cell_membrane_detailed_diagram_4.svg.png
