62.9	Missouri_Compromise	Missouri Compromise	The Missouri Compromise was an agreement passed in 1820 between the pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in the United States Congress, involving primarily the regulation of slavery in the western territories. It prohibited slavery in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36°30′ north except within the boundaries of the proposed state of Missouri. Prior to the agreement, the House of Representatives had refused to accept this compromise, and a conference committee was appointed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/USA_Territorial_Growth_1820_alt.jpg/300px-USA_Territorial_Growth_1820_alt.jpg
