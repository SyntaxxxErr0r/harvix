He traveled 7,000 miles (11,000 km) from Zanzibar in the east to Boma in the mouth of the Congo in the west. He thereby solved many questions that were still open on the central Africa geography, including those on the source of the Nile. He proved that the Lualala river continued as the Congo river â€“ not as Nile.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Henry_Morton_Stanley%2C_1872.jpg/300px-Henry_Morton_Stanley%2C_1872.jpg
