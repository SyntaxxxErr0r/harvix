39.68	Transponder	Transponder	In telecommunication, a transponder is one of two types of devices. In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a transponder is a device that emits an identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a transponder gathers signals over a range of uplink frequencies and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/407_Transponder.jpg/120px-407_Transponder.jpg
