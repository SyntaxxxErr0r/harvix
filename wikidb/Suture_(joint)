4.20	Suture_(joint)	Suture (joint)	A suture is a type of fibrous joint which only occurs in the skull (or "cranium"). They are bound together by Sharpey's fibres. A tiny amount of movement is permitted at sutures, which contributes to the compliance and elasticity of the skull.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Gray188.png/250px-Gray188.png
