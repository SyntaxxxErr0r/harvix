2.00	Malagana	Malagana	Malagana, also known as the Malagana Treasure is an archaeological site of Colombia named after the same name sugarcane estate where it was accidentally discovered in 1992 (Malagana being a misspelling of Malaga). During a few days after its discovery, the place was subject to a large scale looting with a rough estimated of 4 tons of precolumbian artifacts illegally removed from the burial mounds. A rescue archaeological mission was sent by the National Institute of Anthropology and History, led by archaeologist Marianne Cardale. Archaeological excavations at the site established a previously unknown cultural complex, designated as Malagana-Sonsoid, that dates between 300 BC to 300 AD	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/MunsValledelCauca_Palmira.png/220px-MunsValledelCauca_Palmira.png
