The rock formation is named after James Caudy, an early Hampshire County pioneer and settler who fought off an attack by fifteen Native Americans from the rock in the 1730s. Caudy's Castle is also known as Castle Rock. The pillar lies on the southern end of its namesake, Castle Mountain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/CaudysCastleRockWV.JPG/220px-CaudysCastleRockWV.JPG
