2.00	Milton%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador	Milton, Newfoundland and Labrador	Milton is a small former logging community on Smith Sound, Trinity Bay, on the island of Newfoundland in the Canadian Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Situated on the shores of the inner reaches of Smith Sound the community is on Route 230-A, which starts at Clarenville and continues to the intersection at Route 230. Nesled in the lee of the Greeps Nest Hill, the winters are mild and spring to fall are pleasantly warm and attributes its climate to the protection of its environment from the sheltering effects of Random Island from the open Atlantic. The community was originally settled in 1868 after two previous "wintering-over" by Wm. James Adams and his four sons and three of his four daughters. They came to the area from Old Perlican on the east side of Trinity Bay. Originally named King's Cove, it changed its name to Milton (it is believed after the poet John Milton) in the 1920s. It has always been a logging town and at its height in the 30's possessed four water-powered and 8 gas-powered saw mills. The only remnants of its logging history is found in the name of the small brook that runs through the town called THE SAW PIT BROOK". At another point in its history it was also a siding for the branch railway line to Bonivista. This element was run by Mr. Herbert Adams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Newfoundland_map.png/250px-Newfoundland_map.png
