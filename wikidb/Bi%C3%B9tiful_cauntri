4.00	Bi%C3%B9tiful_cauntri	Biùtiful cauntri	Biùtiful cauntri is a 2007 Italian documentary film about illegal toxic waste dumping in Southern Italy. It was directed by Esmeralda Calabria and Andrea D'Ambrosio and written by Calabria, D'Ambrosio and Peppe Ruggiero. It focuses on the progressive poisoning of thousands of square miles of Southern Italian agricultural land and the deadly effects upon people, animals, and plant life in the areas of Sicily and Naples, and behind that the interwoven relations between the Italian government, corrupt pseudo-legitimate businessmen, and the Italian organized crime group, the Camorra. A secondary focus of the film is governmental inaction, in some cases lasting over a decade and a half, despite the pleas of the people affected.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/75/Bi%C3%B9tiful_cauntri_poster.jpg
