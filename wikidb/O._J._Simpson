53.0	O._J._Simpson	O. J. Simpson	Orenthal James "O. J." Simpson (born July 9, 1947), nicknamed "The Juice", is a retired American college and professional football player, football broadcaster, and actor, currently incarcerated as a convicted criminal. Simpson was a running back, the American Football League's Buffalo Bills' first overall pick in the 1969 Common Draft, and the first professional football player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season, a mark he set in 1973. While five other players have passed the 2,000 rush yard mark he stands alone as the only player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a fourteen-game season (professional football changed to a sixteen-game season in 1978). He holds the record for the single season yards-per-game average, which stands at 143.1 ypg. Simpson was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. He also had a successful career in acting and sports commentary.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/O.J._Simpson_1990_%C2%B7_DN-ST-91-03444_crop.JPEG/220px-O.J._Simpson_1990_%C2%B7_DN-ST-91-03444_crop.JPEG
