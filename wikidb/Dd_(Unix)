73.9	Dd_(Unix)	dd (Unix)	In computing, dd is a common Unix program whose primary purpose is the low-level copying and conversion of raw data. According to the manual page for Version 7 Unix, it will "convert and copy a file". It is used to copy a specified number of bytes or blocks, performing on-the-fly byte order conversions, as well as more esoteric EBCDIC to ASCII conversions. It can also be used to copy regions of raw device files, for example backing up the boot sector of a hard disk, or to read fixed amounts of data from special files like /dev/zero or /dev/random.
