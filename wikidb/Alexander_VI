20.71	Alexander_VI	Pope Alexander VI	Pope Alexander VI (Spanish: ), born Roderic Llançol i de Borja (Spanish: ; 1 January 1431 – August 1503) was pope from 1492 until his death on 18 August 1503. He is one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes, and his Italianized surname Borgia became a byword for the debased standards of the Papacy of that era, most notoriously the Banquet of Chestnuts in 1501.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Pope_Alexander_Vi.jpg/220px-Pope_Alexander_Vi.jpg
