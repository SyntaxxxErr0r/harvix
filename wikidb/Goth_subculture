144.5	Goth_subculture	Goth subculture	The goth subculture is a contemporary subculture found in many countries. It began in England during the early 1980s in the gothic rock scene, an offshoot of the post-punk genre. The goth subculture has survived much longer than others of the same era, and has continued to diversify. Its imagery and cultural proclivities indicate influences from the 19th century Gothic literature along with horror films and to a lesser extent the BDSM culture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Gothic_girl.jpg/200px-Gothic_girl.jpg
