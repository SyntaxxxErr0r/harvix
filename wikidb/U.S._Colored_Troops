7.10	U.S._Colored_Troops	United States Colored Troops	The United States Colored Troops were regiments of the United States Army during the American Civil War that were composed of African American ("colored") soldiers. First recruited in 1863, by the end of the Civil War, the men of the 175 regiments of the USCT constituted approximately one-tenth of the Union Army. The men of the USCT were the forerunners of the well-known Buffalo Soldiers, who fought in the Indian Wars later in the nineteenth century and received their nickname in the American West.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/22nd_US_Colored_Troops_banner.jpg/260px-22nd_US_Colored_Troops_banner.jpg
