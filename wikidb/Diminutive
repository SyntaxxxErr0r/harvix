59.1	Diminutive	Diminutive	In Lowland Scots diminutives are used much more frequently than in some other forms of English. The diminutive is formed by the suffix -ie, -ock, -ockie (double diminutive) or â€“ag (the latter from Scottish Gaelic, and probably influencing the other two before it). -ie is by far the most common prefix used.
