1.00	Water_Street,_Hong_Kong	Water Street, Hong Kong	Water Street (Chinese: 水街) is a street in Sai Ying Pun, Hong Kong. It runs from Connaught Road, crossing Des Voeux Road West and Queen's Road West then climbing steeply up the hill crossing Second Street, Third Street and then end in steps to High Street and Pok Fu Lam Road conjunction. Originally, there was a nullah in the middle of the street carrying water from the hills down to the harbour. With the development of the area, the nullah was covered and used for hot food hawkers market for many years and this was a favourable night meeting spot for professional drivers such as taxis and trucks to have their dinner and late night gathering until 15 years ago when the foodstalls were removed to give way for more traffic lanes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/HK_Sai_Ying_Pun_Water_Street_Ramada_Hotel.jpg/220px-HK_Sai_Ying_Pun_Water_Street_Ramada_Hotel.jpg
