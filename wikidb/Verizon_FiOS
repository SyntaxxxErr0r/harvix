62.6	Verizon_FiOS	Verizon FiOS	Verizon FiOS is a bundled Internet access, telephone, and television service which operates over a fiber-optic communications network. It is offered in some areas of the United States by Verizon Communications. Verizon was one of the first major U.S. carriers to offer fiber to the home, and received positive ratings from Consumer Reports among cable television and Internet service providers. Other service providers often use fiber optics in the network backbone and existing copper or infrastructure for residential users. Service began in 2005, and coverage areas expanded through 2010, although some areas do not have service or cannot receive TV and phone service because of franchise agreements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Verizon_FiOS_logo.svg/220px-Verizon_FiOS_logo.svg.png
