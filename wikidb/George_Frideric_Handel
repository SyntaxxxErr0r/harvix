120.7	George_Frideric_Handel	George Frideric Handel	George Frideric Handel (23 February 1685 â€“ 14 April 1759) was a German-British Baroque composer, famous for his operas, oratorios, anthems and organ concertos. Handel was born in 1685, in a family indifferent to music. He received critical musical training in Halle, Hamburg and Italy before settling in London (1712) and becoming a naturalised British subject in 1727. By then he was strongly influenced by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Georg_Friedrich_H%C3%A4ndel.jpg/260px-Georg_Friedrich_H%C3%A4ndel.jpg
