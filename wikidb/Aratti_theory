1.00	Aratti_theory	Jiroft culture	A "Jiroft culture" has been postulated as an early Bronze Age (late 3rd millennium BC) archaeological culture, located in what is now Iran's Sistan and KermƒÅn Provinces. The hypothesis is based on a collection of artifacts that were confiscated in Iran and accepted by many to have derived from the Jiroft area in south central Iran, reported by online Iranian news services, beginning in 2001.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Faravahar_at_Behistun.jpg/200px-Faravahar_at_Behistun.jpg
