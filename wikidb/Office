69.9	Office	Office	An office is generally a room or other area in which people work, but may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer, office-holder, official); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty. When used as an adjective, the term "office" may refer to business-related tasks. In legal writing, a company or organization has offices in any place that it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of, for example, a storage silo rather than an office.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/OpenPlanRedBalloon1.jpg/240px-OpenPlanRedBalloon1.jpg
