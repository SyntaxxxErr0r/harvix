1.40	Cauliflower_ears	Cauliflower ear	Cauliflower ear (complication of hematoma auris, perichondrial hematoma, or traumatic auricular hematoma) is a condition that occurs when the external portion of the ear suffers a blow, blood clot or other collection of fluid under the perichondrium. This separates the cartilage from the overlying perichondrium that supplies its nutrients, causing it to die and resulting in the formation of fibrous tissue in the overlying skin. As a result, the outer ear becomes permanently swollen and deformed, resembling a cauliflower.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Cauliflower_Ear.jpg/230px-Cauliflower_Ear.jpg
