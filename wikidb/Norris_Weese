2.00	Norris_Weese	Norris Weese	Norris Lee Weese (August 12, 1951 - January 20, 1995) was a star quarterback for Chalmette High School and the University of Mississippi. He had the unenviable task of replacing Mississippi QB legend Archie Manning, but performed quite well despite the big shoes to fill. He played the 1974 season for The Hawaiians in the World Football League before joining the NFL. Weese spent four seasons in the NFL playing for the Denver Broncos(1976-1979), mostly as a backup quarterback.
