1.00	Candied_rinds	Succade	Succade is the candied peel of any of the citrus species, especially from the citron or Citrus medica which is distinct with its extra thick peel; in addition, the taste of the inner rind of the citron is less bitter than those of the other citrus. However the term is also occasionally applied to the peel, root, or even entire fruit or vegetables like parsley, fennel and cucurbita which have bitter taste and are boiled with sugar to get a special "sweet and sour" outcome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Candied_mixed_peel.jpg/250px-Candied_mixed_peel.jpg
