2.00	Polycleitus	Polykleitos	Polykleitos (or Polyklitos, Polycleitus, Polyclitus; Greek Πολύκλειτος); called the Elder, was a Greek sculptor in bronze of the fifth and the early 4th century BCE. Next to Phidias, Myron and Kresilas, he is considered the most important sculptor of Classical antiquity: the 4th-century catalogue attributed to Xenocrates (the "Xenocratic catalogue"), which was Pliny's guide in matters of art, ranked him between Phidias and Myron.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Doryphoros.jpg/150px-Doryphoros.jpg
