70.6	Hydropower	Hydropower	Hydropower, hydrokinetic power or water power is power that is derived from the force or energy of falling water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes. Since ancient times, hydropower has been used for irrigation and the operation of various mechanical devices, such as watermills, sawmills, textile mills, dock cranes, and domestic lifts. Since the early 20th century, the term is used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of hydro-electric power, the energy of which could be transmitted considerable distance between where it was created to where it was consumed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/SaintAnthonyFalls.jpg/200px-SaintAnthonyFalls.jpg
