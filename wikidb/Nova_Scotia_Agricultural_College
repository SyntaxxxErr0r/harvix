3.30	Nova_Scotia_Agricultural_College	Nova Scotia Agricultural College	NSAC entered a new era in 1980 after the Nova Scotia government passed legislation authorizing the institution to grant undergraduate B.Sc. (Agr.) degrees. The decision was made by the institution to do this in association with Dalhousie University and the first students graduated with the new degree in 1985. An agreement was also signed with Dalhousie to provide MSc degrees in 1996. NSAC grants its own technology diplomas for the 2-year programs and the institution remains an independent post-secondary research and education facility administered by the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8e/Nsac_logo.png
