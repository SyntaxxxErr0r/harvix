51.6	Low-pass_filter	Low-pass filter	An ideal low-pass filter completely eliminates all frequencies above the cutoff frequency while passing those below unchanged: its frequency response is a rectangular function, and is a brick-wall filter. The transition region present in practical filters does not exist in an ideal filter. An ideal low-pass filter can be realized mathematically (theoretically) by multiplying a signal by the rectangular function in the frequency domain or, equivalently, convolution with its impulse response, a sinc function, in the time domain.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Sinc_function_%28normalized%29.svg/220px-Sinc_function_%28normalized%29.svg.png
