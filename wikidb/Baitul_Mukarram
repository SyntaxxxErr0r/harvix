3.33	Baitul_Mukarram	Baitul Mukarram	Baitul Mukarram (Arabic: â€Ž; Bengali: ; The Holy House) is the national mosque of Bangladesh. Located at the center of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, the mosque was completed in 1968. The mosque has a capacity of 30,000, giving it the respectable position of being the 10th biggest mosque in the world. However the mosque is constantly getting overcrowded. This especially occurs during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which has resulted in the Bangladeshi government having to add extensions to the mosque, thus increasing the capacity to at least 40,000.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Bayt_al_Mukarram.jpg/250px-Bayt_al_Mukarram.jpg
