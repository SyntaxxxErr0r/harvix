4.00	Heeb_(magazine)	Heeb	Heeb was a Jewish magazine aimed predominantly at young Jews. The name of the magazine is a variation of the ethnic slur "hebe", an abbreviation of Hebrew. However, in this case, the word "heeb" seeks to function as empowerment for the Jewish community, thus eliminating the hatred associated with the word. The printed magazine was closed in 2010, but the website continues publication.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/HeebCover.PNG/220px-HeebCover.PNG
