94.9	Dust_Bowl	Dust Bowl	The Dust Bowl, or the Dirty Thirties, was a period of severe dust storms causing major ecological and agricultural damage to American and Canadian prairie lands in the 1930's, particularly in 1934 and 1936. The phenomenon was caused by severe drought coupled with decades of extensive farming without crop rotation, fallow fields, cover crops or other techniques to prevent wind erosion. Deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains had displaced the natural deep-rooted grasses that normally kept the soil in place and trapped moisture even during periods of drought and high winds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Farmer_walking_in_dust_storm_Cimarron_County_Oklahoma2.jpg/300px-Farmer_walking_in_dust_storm_Cimarron_County_Oklahoma2.jpg
