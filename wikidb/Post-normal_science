31.43	Post-normal_science	Post-normal science	Post-Normal Science is a concept developed by Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome Ravetz, attempting to characterise a methodology of inquiry that is appropriate for cases where "facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent" (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1991). It is primarily applied in the context of long-term issues where there is less available information than is desired by stakeholders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Post-normal_Science_diagram.png/220px-Post-normal_Science_diagram.png
