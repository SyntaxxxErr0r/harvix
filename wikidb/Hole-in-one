7.00	Hole-in-one	Hole in one	In golf, a hole in one or hole-in-one (also known as an ace, mostly in American English) is when a player hits the ball directly from the tee into the cup with one shot. (It is not necessary that the ball go directly into the cup. It may hit other objects, or the ground, on its way.) This is most possible on a par 3 hole. Longer hitters have accomplished this feat on shorter par 4 holes. Nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot; a hole in two on a par five (or a hole in one on a par 4) is known as an albatross, and is significantly rarer than a hole in one on a par 3 (especially since an albatross is only possible on a par 5 hole).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Golfball.jpg/220px-Golfball.jpg
