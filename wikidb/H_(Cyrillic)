1.00	H_(Cyrillic)	Shha	Shha (italics: ) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. Its form is derived from the Latin letter H (H h ), but the capital forms are more similar to an inverted Cyrillic letter Che (Ч) because the Cyrillic letter En (Н н) already has the same form as the Latin letter H.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Cyrillic_letter_Shha.png
