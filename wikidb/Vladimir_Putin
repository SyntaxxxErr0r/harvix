191.4	Vladimir_Putin	Vladimir Putin	Because of constitutionally mandated term limits, Putin was ineligible to run for a third consecutive presidential term. After his successor Dmitry Medvedev won the 2008 presidential election, Putin was nominated by Medvedev to be Russia's Prime Minister; Putin took office on 8 May 2008 and a period of so-called "tandemocracy" followed. In September 2011, Putin and Medvedev agreed he should seek a third, non-consecutive term in the 2012 presidential election, which he won in the first round on 4 March 2012.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Vladimir_Putin_official_portrait.jpg/220px-Vladimir_Putin_official_portrait.jpg
