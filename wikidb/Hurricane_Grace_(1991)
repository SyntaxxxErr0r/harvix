3.10	Hurricane_Grace_(1991)	Hurricane Grace (1991)	Hurricane Grace was a short-lived Category 2 hurricane that contributed to the formation of the powerful 1991 Perfect Storm. Forming on October 26, Grace initially had subtropical origins, meaning it was partially tropical and partially extratropical in nature. It became a tropical cyclone on October 27, and ultimately peaked with winds of 85 knots (100 mph; 160 km/h). The storm had minor effects on the island of Bermuda as it passed to the south. A developing extratropical storm to the north turned Grace eastward; the hurricane was eventually absorbed into the large circulation of the larger low pressure system. Fed by the contrast between cold air to the northwest and warm air from the remnants of Hurricane Grace, this storm became a large and powerful nor'easter that caused extremely high waves and resulted in severe coastal damage along the U.S. East Coast.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Hurricane_Grace_%281991%29.JPG/220px-Hurricane_Grace_%281991%29.JPG
