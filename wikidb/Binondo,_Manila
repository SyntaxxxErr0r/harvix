15.23	Binondo,_Manila	Binondo, Manila	Binondo is an enclave in Manila primarily populated by ethnic Chinese living in the Philippines. It is the oldest Chinatown in the world, established in 1594. Historically, this was where the Spanish permitted converted sangleys, their indigenous Filipino wives, and their mixed-race descendants, the mestizos de sangley or Chinese mestizos, to reside. Similarly, Parían, an area near Intramuros, was where the Spanish first restricted unconverted Chinese immigrants. They allowed sangley settlement at Parían because it was within the range of Intramuros' cannons, and they felt they could control any uprising from the labourers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Manila_3rd_congressional_district.PNG/200px-Manila_3rd_congressional_district.PNG
