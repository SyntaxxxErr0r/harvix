52.7	Popcorn	Popcorn	Popcorn, or popping corn, is corn which expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated. Corn is able to pop because, like sorghum, quinoa and millet, its kernels have a hard moisture-sealed hull and a dense starchy interior. This allows pressure to build inside the kernel until an explosive "pop" results. Some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Popcorn_-_Studio_-_2011.jpg/220px-Popcorn_-_Studio_-_2011.jpg
