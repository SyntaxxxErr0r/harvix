95.7	Fantasy	Fantasy	Fantasy is a genre of fiction that commonly uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Dobryna.jpg/220px-Dobryna.jpg
