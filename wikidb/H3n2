3.01	H3n2	Influenza A virus subtype H3N2	Influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (also H3N2) is a subtype of viruses that causes influenza (flu). H3N2 Viruses can infect birds and mammals. In birds, humans, and pigs, the virus has mutated into many strains. H3N2 is increasingly abundant in seasonal influenza, which kills an estimated 36,000 people in the United States each year. In the last half of 2011, a dozen human cases of a new variant of the disease have been found in the U.S.A. This new variant is called H3N2v. It appears to be transmissible among humans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/H1N1_navbox.jpg/185px-H1N1_navbox.jpg
