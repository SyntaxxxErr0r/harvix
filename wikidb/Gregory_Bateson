114.7	Gregory_Bateson	Gregory Bateson	Gregory Bateson (9 May 1904 â€“ 4 July 1980) was an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician and cyberneticist whose work intersected that of many other fields. In the 1940s he helped extend systems theory/cybernetics to the social/behavioral sciences, and spent the last decade of his life developing a "meta-science" of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in various fields of science. Some of his most noted writings are to be found in his books, Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972) and Mind and Nature (1979). Angels Fear (published posthumously in 1987) was co-authored by his daughter Mary Catherine Bateson.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b0/Arnhein_and_Bateson.jpg/220px-Arnhein_and_Bateson.jpg
