56.0	Financial_crisis	Financial crisis	The term financial crisis is applied broadly to a variety of situations in which some financial institutions or assets suddenly lose a large part of their value. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many financial crises were associated with banking panics, and many recessions coincided with these panics. Other situations that are often called financial crises include stock market crashes and the bursting of other financial bubbles, currency crises, and sovereign defaults. Financial crises directly result in a loss of paper wealth; they do not directly result in changes in the real economy unless a recession or depression follows.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png
