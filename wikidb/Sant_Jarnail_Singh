1.00	Sant_Jarnail_Singh	Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale	Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale (Punjabi: , born Jarnail Singh Brar (Punjabi: )) (12 February 1947 âˆ’ 6 June 1984) was the leader of the Damdami Taksal, a Sikh religious group based in India, who supported implementation of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution. In 1981, Bhindranwale was arrested for his suspected involvement in the murder of Jagat Narain, the proprietor of the Hind Samachar Group. He surrendered to police and was later released due to lack of evidence. Bhindranwale was also, however, kept on close watch by Indian police officials. Bhindranwale is more notable for his involvement in Operation Blue Star in which he and his supporters who believed in Bhindranwale's objectives, occupied the Akal Takht complex, including the Golden Temple, in Amritsar. He was killed by the Indian Army, who had orders from Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to remove all armed militants inside the temple. Since his death, Bhindranwale has remained a controversial figure in Indian history. While the Sikhs highest authority Akal Takht describe him a great martyr of the Sikh Nation, who made supreme sacrifice for the sake of faith, the Indian government views him as a misguided militant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/97/Sant_Jarnail_Singh_Bhindranwale.jpg/300px-Sant_Jarnail_Singh_Bhindranwale.jpg
