1.10	Mary,_Mother_of_God	Mary (mother of Jesus)	Mary , variously called Saint Mary, Mother Mary, the Virgin Mary, the Theotokos, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mary, Mother of God, and, in Islam, as Maryam, mother of 'Isa, was a Jewish woman of Nazareth in Galilee who lived in the late 1st century BC and early 1st century AD, and is considered by Christians to be the first proselyte to Christianity. She is identified in the New Testament and in the Qur'an as the mother of Jesus through divine intervention. Jesus is viewed as the messiah—the Christ—in both traditions, giving rise to the common name of Jesus Christ.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/The_Madonna_in_Sorrow.jpg/220px-The_Madonna_in_Sorrow.jpg
