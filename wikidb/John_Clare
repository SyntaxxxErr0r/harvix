52.0	John_Clare	John Clare	John Clare (13 July 1793 â€“ 20 May 1864) was an English poet, born the son of a farm labourer who came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation of its disruption. His poetry underwent a major re-evaluation in the late 20th century and he is often now considered to be among the most important 19th-century poets. His biographer Jonathan Bate states that Clare was "the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/John_Clare.jpg/220px-John_Clare.jpg
