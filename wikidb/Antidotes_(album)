8.31	Antidotes_(album)	Antidotes (album)	Antidotes is the debut studio album by British indie rock band Foals. It was released on 24 March 2008 in the United Kingdom on Transgressive Records, and on 8 April 2008 in the United States through Sub Pop. The album was recorded in Stay Gold Studios Brooklyn in summer 2007, and was produced by TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek. However, Foals remixed Antidotes in London, complaining that he made it sound like it was "recorded in the Grand Canyon."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Foalsantidotescover.jpg/220px-Foalsantidotescover.jpg
