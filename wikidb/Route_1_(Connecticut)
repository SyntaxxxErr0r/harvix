1.00	Route_1_(Connecticut)	U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut	In the U.S. state of Connecticut, U.S. Route 1 is a major east–west state highway along Long Island Sound. It has been replaced by Interstate 95 as a through route, which it closely parallels, and now primarily serves as a local business route. Despite its east–west orientation, it is part of a north–south route, and so most signs show it as north–south.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/US_1_%28CT%29_map.svg/290px-US_1_%28CT%29_map.svg.png
