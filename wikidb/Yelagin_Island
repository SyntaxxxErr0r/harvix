Yelagin Island is home to the Yelagin Palace but has few other buildings; the island initially served as a wooded retreat for the ruling class. Originally known as Melgunov Island, the island takes its present name from its former owner, Ivan Yelagin (1725-93), best known as a founding father of the Russian Freemasonry. After the Russian Revolution, the isle was opened to the public as an urban park which still bears the name of Sergei Kirov.
