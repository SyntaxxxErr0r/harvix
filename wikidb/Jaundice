70.1	Jaundice	Jaundice	Jaundice (also known as icterus; attributive adjective: icteric) is a yellowish pigmentation of the skin, the conjunctival membranes over the sclerae (whites of the eyes), and other mucous membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia (increased levels of bilirubin in the blood). This hyperbilirubinemia subsequently causes increased levels of bilirubin in the extracellular fluid. Concentration of bilirubin in blood plasma does not normally exceed 1 mg/dL (&gt;17µmol/L). A concentration higher than 1.8 mg/dL (&gt;30µmol/L) leads to jaundice. The term jaundice comes from the French word jaune, meaning yellow.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Jaundice08.jpg/220px-Jaundice08.jpg
