2.11	Tiara_of_Pope_Paul_VI	Tiara of Pope Paul VI	The Tiara of Pope Paul VI was the last papal tiara worn to date. It was donated by the see of Milan when its cardinal, Giovanni Montini, was elected Pope Paul VI in the 1963 papal conclave. It was this tiara that was used to crown Pope Paul VI in 1963, which was the last papal coronation to date. Previously, the Palatine Tiara had been used in coronations since 1877.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Pope_Paul_VI_Tiara_2.jpg/220px-Pope_Paul_VI_Tiara_2.jpg
