70.1	Reservoir_Dogs	Reservoir Dogs	Reservoir Dogs is a 1992 American crime film marking the debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It depicts the events before and after a botched diamond heist, but not the heist itself. Reservoir Dogs stars an ensemble cast: Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker. It incorporates many themes that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profuse profanity, and a nonlinear storyline. The film contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City On Fire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Reservoir_dogs_ver1.jpg/220px-Reservoir_dogs_ver1.jpg
