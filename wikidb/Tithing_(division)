1.10	Tithing_(division)	Tithing	The English land division called the tithing was a grouping of ten households (Scandinavian: ten = ti, assembly = thing). Allied to this concept was a local administrative unit also called a tithing or tything, with essentially legal responsibilities, exercised by a "tithingman". Both meanings originated in Anglo-Saxon times, through arrangements for the management of estates, taxation and criminal law, for example in the procedure known as "view of frankpledge." In Kent, the equivalent to a tithing was a "borgh", or "borough", not to be confused with ancient boroughs, and the equivalent to the tithingman was the "borsholder", "borough-holder" or "headborough".
