1.00	Italian_general_election,_1972	Italian general election, 1972	General elections were held in Italy on 7 May 1972. Democrazia Cristiana (DC) remained stable with around 38% of the votes, as it happened to the Communist Party (PCI) which obtained the same 27% of 1968. The Socialist Party (PSI) continued in its decline, reducing to less than 10%. The most important growth was that of the post-fascist Italian Social Movement, who nearly doubled its votes from 4.5 to c. 9%, after that its leader Giorgio Almirante launched the formula of the National Right, proposing his party as the sole group of the Italian right side. After the dismaying result, less than 2%, against 4.5% of 1968, the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity was disbanded, its majority joining the Italian Communist Party.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/Arnaldo_Forlani.jpg/120px-Arnaldo_Forlani.jpg
