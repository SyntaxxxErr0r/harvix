62.9	Kesha	Kesha	Kesha Rose Sebert (born March 1, 1987), known professionally as Kesha , is an American singer-songwriter and rapper. In 2005, at 18, Kesha was signed to Dr. Luke's record label, Kemosabe Entertainment, and publishing company. Although an active musician since then, singing background vocals and writing songs for other artists, her breakthrough came in early 2009 after appearing on Flo Rida's number one single, "Right Round." Her debut album, Animal and its re-release, Cannibal, were released in 2010. Kesha's irreverent music and image propelled her to immediate commercial success, with Animal debuting as the US's number-one album and producing two number-one singles, "Tik Tok" and "We R Who We R", and a string of top ten hits as well. At the same time, she continued to write songs for other artists, including co-writing "Till the World Ends" for Britney Spears.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Kesha_2011_2_crop_adj.jpg/220px-Kesha_2011_2_crop_adj.jpg
