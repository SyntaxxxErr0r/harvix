114.1	Framing_(social_sciences)	Framing (social sciences)	A frame in social theory consists of a schema of interpretation, a collection of anecdotes and stereotypes, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events. In other words, people build a series of mental filters through biological and cultural influences. They use these filters to make sense of the world. The choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame. Framing is also a key component of sociology, the study of social interaction among humans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Daniel_KAHNEMAN.jpg
