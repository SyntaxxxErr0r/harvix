1.10	Hemitriccus	Hemitriccus	Hemitriccus is a genus of small South American birds in the Tyrannidae family. They are commonly known as tody-tyrants or bamboo tyrants, but the former name is (or was) also shared with several members of the genus Poecilotriccus. Several species from the genus Hemitriccus are very similar, and consequently best separated by their voice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Hemitriccus_granadensis_2.jpg/220px-Hemitriccus_granadensis_2.jpg
