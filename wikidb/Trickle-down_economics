114.1	Trickle-down_economics	Trickle-down economics	"Trickle-down economics" and "the trickle-down theory" are terms in United States politics often used by the American left to refer to the idea that tax breaks or other economic benefits provided by government to businesses and the wealthy will benefit poorer members of society by improving the economy as a whole. The term has been attributed to humorist Will Rogers, who said during the Great Depression that "money was all appropriated for the top in hopes that it would trickle down to the needy." The term is considered pejorative by some proponents of tax cuts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/CBO_Revenues_Outlays_Percentage_GDP.svg/300px-CBO_Revenues_Outlays_Percentage_GDP.svg.png
