2.00	Tower_Mounted_Amplifier	Tower Mounted Amplifier	A Tower Mounted Amplifier or Mast Head Amplifier is a Low-noise amplifier (LNA) mounted as close as practical to the antenna in mobile masts or Base Transceiver Stations. A TMA reduces the base transceiver station noise figure (NF) and therefore improve its overall sensitivity; in other words the mobile mast is able to receive weaker signals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/PhoneMast_Elsie.jpg/220px-PhoneMast_Elsie.jpg
