29.83	Matt_Hamill	Matt Hamill	Matthew Stanley Hamill (born October 5, 1976) is a retired American wrestler and mixed martial artist. He is a three-time NCAA Division III National Champion in wrestling (167 lb class in 1997, 190 lb class in 1998 and 197 lb class in 1999) while attending the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester, New York. Hamill also has a silver medal in Greco-Roman wrestling and a gold medal in freestyle wrestling from the 2001 Summer Deaflympics. He is notable for being the only man to defeat the current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones. The defeat however, came by disqualification, as a result of Jones employing illegal elbow strikes. Many consider this a highly tainted way to "earn" a victory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Matt_Hamill_cropped.jpg/200px-Matt_Hamill_cropped.jpg
