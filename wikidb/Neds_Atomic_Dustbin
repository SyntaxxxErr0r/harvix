1.10	Neds_Atomic_Dustbin	Ned's Atomic Dustbin	Ned's Atomic Dustbin are an English rock band formed in Stourbridge in West Midlands in November 1987. The band took their name from an episode of The Goon Show. The band were unusual for using two bass players in their lineup: Alex Griffin played melody lines high up on one bass, and Mat Cheslin played the regular bass lines on the other. This gave the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/NedsWolves07.jpg/220px-NedsWolves07.jpg
