119.1	Carbohydrate	Carbohydrate	A carbohydrate is an organic compound with the empirical formula , that consists only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with a hydrogen:oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water). However, there are exceptions to this. One common example would be deoxyribose, a component of DNA, which has the empirical formula C5H10O4. Carbohydrates are not technically hydrates of carbon. Structurally it is more accurate to view them as polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Lactose.svg/310px-Lactose.svg.png
