1.21	Australopithicus	Australopithecus	Australopithecus (Latin australis "southern", Greek πίθηκος pithekos "ape") is a genus of hominids that is now extinct. From the evidence gathered by palaeontologists and archaeologists, it appears that the Australopithecus genus evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 2 million years ago. During this time period various forms of australopiths existed, including Australopithecus anamensis, A. afarensis, A. sediba, and A. africanus. There is still some debate amongst academics whether certain African hominid species of this time, such as A. robustus and A. boisei, constitute members of the same genus; if so, they would be considered to be robust australopiths whilst the others would be considered gracile australopiths. However, if these species do indeed constitute their own genus, then they may be given their own name, the Paranthropus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Australopithecusafarensis_reconstruction.jpg/250px-Australopithecusafarensis_reconstruction.jpg
