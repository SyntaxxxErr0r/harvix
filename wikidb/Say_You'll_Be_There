3.30	Say_You'll_Be_There	Say You'll Be There	"Say You'll Be There" is a song by British pop group Spice Girls. It was written by the Spice Girls and Eliot Kennedy, for their debut album Spice, released in November 1996. Production duo Absolute incorporated a mix of pop and R&amp;B into the song, which includes an harmonica solo, played by Judd Lander. The lyrics—which described the things the group have been through together and how they always have been there for each other—received mixed reviews from critics, who described them as "confusing" and felt that the R&amp;B-infused production was a "bid for street cred".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Say_You%27ll_Be_There.jpg/220px-Say_You%27ll_Be_There.jpg
