74.4	Statute_of_Anne	Statute of Anne	The Statute of Anne (c.19), an act of the Parliament of Great Britain, was the first statute to provide for copyright regulated by the government and courts, rather than by private parties. Prior to the statute's enactment in 1710, copying restrictions were authorized by the Licensing Act. These restrictions were enforced by the Stationers' Company, a guild of printers given the exclusive power to print—and the responsibility to censor—literary works. The censorship administered under the Licensing Act led to public protest; as the act had to be renewed at two-year intervals, authors and others sought to prevent its reauthorisation. In 1694, Parliament refused to renew the Licensing Act, ending the Stationers' monopoly and press restrictions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Coat_of_Arms_of_Great_Britain_%281714-1801%29.svg/140px-Coat_of_Arms_of_Great_Britain_%281714-1801%29.svg.png
