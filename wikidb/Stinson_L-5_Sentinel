4.20	Stinson_L-5_Sentinel	Stinson L-5 Sentinel	The Stinson L-5 Sentinel was a World War II era liaison aircraft used by all branches of the U.S. military and by the British Royal Air Force. Along with the Stinson L-1 Vigilant, the L-5 was the only other American liaison aircraft of WWII that was purpose-built for military use and had no civilian counterpart. All other military liaison airplanes adopted during World War II were lightly modified "off-the-shelf" civilian models.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/L-5futureshox.jpg/300px-L-5futureshox.jpg
