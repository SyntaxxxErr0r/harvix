10.10	Buckboard	Buckboard	A buckboard is a four-wheeled wagon of simple construction meant to be drawn by a horse or other large animal. The "buckboard" is the front-most board on the wagon that could act as both a footrest for the driver and protection for the driver from the horse's rear hooves in case of a "buck". The buckboard is steered by its front wheels, which are connected to each other by a single axle. The front and rear axle are connected by a platform of one or more boards to which the front axle is connected on a pivoting joint at its midpoint. A buckboard wagon often carries a seat for a driver. Such a seat may be supported by springs. The main platform between axles is not suspended by springs like a carriage. Made in the 18th century around the same time as carriages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Duke%27s_Cigarrettes_insert_card_Buckboard2.JPG/220px-Duke%27s_Cigarrettes_insert_card_Buckboard2.JPG
