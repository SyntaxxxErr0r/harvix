Satay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu; the more authentic version uses skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond, although bamboo skewers are often used. These are grilled or barbecued over a wood or charcoal fire, then served with various spicy seasonings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Sate_Ponorogo.jpg/250px-Sate_Ponorogo.jpg
