The name "Art Nouveau" is French for "new art". It is known also as Jugendstil, pronounced , German for "youth style", named after the magazine Jugend, which promoted it, as Modern (Модерн) in Russia, perhaps named after Parisian gallery "La Maison Moderne", as Secession in Austria-Hungary and its successor states after the Viennese group of artists, and, in Italy, as Stile Liberty from the department store in London, Liberty &amp; Co., which popularised the style. A reaction to academic art of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, not only in flowers and plants but also in curved lines. Architects tried to harmonize with the natural environment. It is also considered a philosophy of design of furniture, which was designed according to the whole building and made part of ordinary life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Alfons_Mucha_-_F._Champenois_Imprimeur-%C3%89diteur.jpg/200px-Alfons_Mucha_-_F._Champenois_Imprimeur-%C3%89diteur.jpg
