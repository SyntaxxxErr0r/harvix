196.6	NoSQL	NoSQL	In computing, NoSQL is a broad class of database management systems that differ from the classic model of the relational database management system (RDBMS) in some significant ways, most important being they do not use SQL as their primary query language. These data stores may not require fixed table schemas, usually do not support join operations, may not give full ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) guarantees, and typically scale horizontally. Academic researchers typically refer to these databases as structured storage, a term that includes classic relational databases as a subset. Network databases, semantic web technologies such as resolvers, and object-oriented databases have recently been renamed "NoSQL" although their capabilities haven't changed. Googles MapReduce, Riak's and other map, filter, reduce pipelines in functional programming that employ fold_(higher-order_function) mechanics also lay claim to the name. Thus NoSQL used in this general sense may be a buzzword. It is questionable in part because there is a specific NoSQL (RDBMS) technology whose name seems deliberately designed to exploit the confusion. See ontological warfare.
