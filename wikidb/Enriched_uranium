94.1	Enriched_uranium	Enriched uranium	Enriched uranium is a kind of uranium in which the percent composition of uranium-235 has been increased through the process of isotope separation. Natural uranium is 99.284% 238U isotope, with 235U only constituting about 0.711% of its weight. 235U is the only nuclide existing in nature (in any appreciable amount) that is fissile with thermal neutrons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Uranium_enrichment_proportions.svg/220px-Uranium_enrichment_proportions.svg.png
