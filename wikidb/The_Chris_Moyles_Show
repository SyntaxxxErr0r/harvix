From 2004 to 2007, the show was broadcast 6:55â€“10:00 am each weekday, but since 15 October 2007 it has started from 6:30 am. It is the longest running Radio 1 breakfast show in the station's history. On 1 July 2011 it was announced that Moyles had signed a contract to keep him at the station until 2014, making it (assuming he stays on the show) a decade on breakfast.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/The_Chris_Moyles_Show_Team_in_2010.jpg/250px-The_Chris_Moyles_Show_Team_in_2010.jpg
