51.2	Baby_boom	Baby boom	A baby boom is any period marked by a greatly increased birth rate. This demographic phenomenon is usually ascribed within certain geographical bounds and when the number of annual births exceeds 2 per 100 women (or approximately 1% of the total population size). People born during such a period are often called baby boomers; however, some experts distinguish between those born during such demographic baby booms and those who identify with the overlapping cultural generations. Conventional wisdom states that baby booms signify good times and periods of general economic growth and stability.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/US_Birth_Rates.svg/500px-US_Birth_Rates.svg.png
