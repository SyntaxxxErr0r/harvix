52.0	Jimmy_Reed	Jimmy Reed	Mathis James "Jimmy" Reed (September 6, 1925 â€“ August 29, 1976) was an American blues musician and songwriter, notable for bringing his distinctive style of blues to mainstream audiences. Reed was a major player in the field of electric blues, as opposed to the more acoustic-based sound of many of his contemporaries. His lazy, slack-jawed singing, piercing harmonica and hypnotic guitar patterns were one of the blues' most easily identifiable sounds in the 1950s and 1960s, and had a significant impact on many rock and roll artists who followed, such as Elvis Presley and the Rolling Stones.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cc/JimmyReed.jpg/220px-JimmyReed.jpg
