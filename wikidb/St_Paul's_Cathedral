108.8	St_Paul's_Cathedral	St Paul's Cathedral	St Paul's Cathedral, London, is a Church of England cathedral and seat of the Bishop of London. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. St Paul's sits at the top of Ludgate Hill, the highest point in the City of London, and is the mother church of the Diocese of London. The present church dating from the late 17th century was built to an English Baroque design of Sir Christopher Wren, as part of a major rebuilding program which took place in the city after the Great Fire of London, and was completed within his lifetime.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/St_Pauls_Cathedral_in_1896.JPG/250px-St_Pauls_Cathedral_in_1896.JPG
