Established in 1883, the team originated in Brooklyn, New York, where it was known by a number of nicknames before becoming the Dodgers definitively by 1932. The team moved to Los Angeles before the 1958 season. They played their first four seasons in Los Angeles at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving to their current home of Dodger Stadium, the third-oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball (trailing Fenway Park and Wrigley Field).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_Logo.png/100px-Los_Angeles_Dodgers_Logo.png
