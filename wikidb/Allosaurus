54.6	Allosaurus	Allosaurus	Allosaurus ( ) is a genus of large theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 150 million years ago during the late Jurassic period . The name Allosaurus means "different lizard". It is derived from the Greek /allos ("different, other") and /sauros ("lizard"). The first remains that can definitely be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several films and documentaries about prehistoric life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Allosaurus_SDNHM.jpg/300px-Allosaurus_SDNHM.jpg
