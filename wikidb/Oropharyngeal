7.22	Oropharyngeal	Human pharynx	The human pharynx (plural: pharynges) is the part of the throat situated immediately posterior to (behind) the mouth and nasal cavity, and superior to the esophagus and larynx. The human pharynx is conventionally divided into three sections: the nasopharynx (epipharynx), the oropharynx (mesopharynx), and the laryngopharynx (hypopharynx). The pharynx is part of the digestive system and also the respiratory system; it is also important in vocalization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Illu01_head_neck.jpg/250px-Illu01_head_neck.jpg
