56.4	Zoom_lens	Zoom lens	A zoom lens is a mechanical assembly of lens elements for which the focal length (and thus angle of view) can be varied, as opposed to a fixed focal length (FFL) lens (see prime lens). They are commonly used with still, video, motion picture cameras, projectors, some binoculars, microscopes, telescopes, telescopic sights, and other optical instruments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Nikkor_28-200_zoom.jpg/220px-Nikkor_28-200_zoom.jpg
