85.2	Central_bank	Central bank	A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a nation's currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also usually oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the nation's monetary base, and usually also prints the national currency, which usually serves as the nation's legal tender. Examples include the European Central Bank (ECB), the Federal Reserve of the United States, and the People's Bank of China.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Government-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg/220px-Government-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg
