7.31	2001-02_in_English_football	2001â€“02 in English football	One of the seven Albion wins in their promotion run came on 16 March 2002, against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. This match, unfortunately, would turn into one of the most ill-tempered in recent English football history, with three United players sent off, two of them for violent conduct in the second half. The match was abandoned with Albion up 3-0 after two other United players came up injured, reducing them to six players. Ultimately, The FA let the 3-0 scoreline stand.
