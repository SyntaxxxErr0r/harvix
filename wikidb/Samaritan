52.7	Samaritan	Samaritan	The Samaritans are an ethnoreligious group of the Levant. Religiously the Samaritans are adherents of Samaritanism, an Abrahamic religion closely related to Judaism. Based on the Samaritan Torah, Samaritans claim their worship is the true religion of the ancient Israelites prior to the Babylonian Exile, preserved by those who remained in the Land of Israel, as opposed to Judaism, which they assert is a related but altered and amended religion brought back by those returning from exile.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Samaritans_marking_Passover_on_Mount_Gerizim%2C_West_Bank_-_20060418.jpg/250px-Samaritans_marking_Passover_on_Mount_Gerizim%2C_West_Bank_-_20060418.jpg
