3.00	Big_Blue_Wrecking_Crew	Big Blue Wrecking Crew	This defensive unit first truly came to the fore front during the 1986 season, and was among the most fearsome of all time, a beautiful example of the 3-4 defense. It featured a powerful defensive line, with George Martin and Leonard Marshall at defensive end, and Jim Burt at nose tackle. The linebacker corp for this team was relentless, featuring Lawrence Taylor as the "Jack", Gary Reasons as the "Will", Harry Carson as the "Mike" and Carl Banks as the "Sam". This front 7 formed what is among the greatest rushing defenses of all time, giving up merely 80.2 rushing yards per game. Additionally, the team accrued 59 sacks, 24 interceptions, and only gave up 14.8 points per game powering the Giants to a 14-2 record.
