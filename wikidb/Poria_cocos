2.00	Poria_cocos	Fu Ling	Wolfiporia extensa (Peck) Ginns (formerly known as Poria cocos F.A. Wolf) is a fungus in the Polyporaceae family. It is a wood-decay fungus but has a terrestrial growth habit. It is notable in the development of a large, long-lasting underground sclerotium that resembles a small coconut. This sclerotium (called "Tuckahoe", or Indian bread) was used by Native Americans as a source of food in times of scarcity. It is also used as a medicinal mushroom in Chinese medicine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/Tuckahoe.jpg/220px-Tuckahoe.jpg
