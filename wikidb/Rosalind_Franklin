87.0	Rosalind_Franklin	Rosalind Franklin	Rosalind Elsie Franklin (25 July 1920 â€“ 16 April 1958) was a British biophysicist and X-ray crystallographer who made critical contributions to the understanding of the fine molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal and graphite. The DNA work achieved the most fame because DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) plays essential roles in cell metabolism and genetics, and the discovery of its structure helped scientists understand how genetic information is passed from parents to children.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/97/Rosalind_Franklin.jpg/160px-Rosalind_Franklin.jpg
