1.00	Common_factor	Factorization	In mathematics, factorization or factoring is the decomposition of an object (for example, a number, a polynomial, or a matrix) into a product of other objects, or factors, which when multiplied together give the original. For example, the number 15 factors into primes as 3 × 5, and the polynomial x2 − 4 factors as (x − 2)(x + 2). In all cases, a product of simpler objects is obtained.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Factorisatie.svg/220px-Factorisatie.svg.png
