2.00	Homilist	Homily	A homily is a commentary that follows a reading of scripture. In Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox Churches, a homily is usually given during Mass (Divine Liturgy for Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, and Divine Service for the Lutheran Church) at the end of the Liturgy of the Word. Many people consider it synonymous with a sermon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/Lutheran_elevation.jpg/120px-Lutheran_elevation.jpg
