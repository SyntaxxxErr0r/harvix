1.00	Laszlo_Rajk	László Rajk	László Rajk (March 8, 1909 Székelyudvarhely – October 15, 1949 Budapest) was a Hungarian Communist; politician, former Minister of Interior and former Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was an important organizer of the Hungarian communist's power (for example, organized the State Protection Authority (ÁVH)); but he eventually fell victim to Rákosi's show trials, probably, apart from the Communist parties' endemic power struggles, because he was a homegrown Communist, as opposed to the Stalin-backed Rákosi.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7f/Laszlo_Rajk.jpg
