19.27	Occupation_of_Denmark	Occupation of Denmark	Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark began with Operation Weser√ºbung on 9 April 1940, and lasted until German forces withdrew at the end of World War II following their surrender to the Allies on 5 May 1945. Contrary to the situation in other countries under German occupation, most Danish institutions continued to function relatively normally until 1943. Both the Danish government and king remained in the country in an uneasy relationship between a democratic and a totalitarian system until German authorities dissolved the government following a wave of strikes and sabotage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Schalburgerblegdamsvej.jpg/220px-Schalburgerblegdamsvej.jpg
