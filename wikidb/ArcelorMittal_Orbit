23.42	ArcelorMittal_Orbit	ArcelorMittal Orbit	The ArcelorMittal Orbit is a 115 metres (377 ft) high observation tower in the Olympic Park in Stratford, London. The steel sculpture is Britain's largest piece of public art, and is a permanent, lasting legacy of London's hosting of the 2012 Summer Olympics, assisting in the post-Olympics regeneration of the Stratford area. Sited between the Olympic Stadium and the Aquatics Centre, allows visitors to view the whole Olympic Park from two observation platforms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/ArcelorMittal_Orbit.png/220px-ArcelorMittal_Orbit.png
