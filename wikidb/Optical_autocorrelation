2.00	Optical_autocorrelation	Optical autocorrelation	In optics, various autocorrelation functions can be experimentally realized. The field autocorrelation may be used to calculate the spectrum of a source of light, while the intensity autocorrelation and the interferometric autocorrelation are commonly used to estimate the duration of ultrashort pulses produced by modelocked lasers. The laser pulse duration cannot be easily measured by optoelectronic methods, since the response time of photodiodes and oscilloscopes are at best of the order of 200 femtoseconds, yet laser pulses can be made as short as a few femtoseconds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Kinds_of_optical_autocorrelation.svg/313px-Kinds_of_optical_autocorrelation.svg.png
