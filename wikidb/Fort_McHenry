54.6	Fort_McHenry	Fort McHenry	Fort McHenry, in Baltimore, Maryland, is a star-shaped fort best known for its role in the War of 1812, when it successfully defended Baltimore Harbor from an attack by the British navy in Chesapeake Bay. It was during the bombardment of the fort that Francis Scott Key was inspired to write "The Star-Spangled Banner," the poem that would eventually be set to the tune of "To Anacreon in Heaven" and become the national anthem of the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Fort_McHenry2.JPG/284px-Fort_McHenry2.JPG
