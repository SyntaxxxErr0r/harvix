55.0	G-force	g-force	The g-force (with g from gravitational) associated with an object is its acceleration relative to free-fall. This acceleration experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of non-gravitational forces acting on an object free to move. The accelerations that are not produced by gravity are termed proper accelerations, and it is only these that are measured in g-force units. They cause stresses and strains on objects, which are felt as weight (any g-force can thus be simply described, and measured, as a "weight per unit mass"). Because of these strains (weight forces), large proper accelerations (large g-forces), may be destructive.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Nitrolympics_TopFuel_2005.jpg/300px-Nitrolympics_TopFuel_2005.jpg
