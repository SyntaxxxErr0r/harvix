1.00	Differentiability	Differentiable function	In calculus (a branch of mathematics), a differentiable function is a function whose derivative exists at each point in its domain. The graph of a differentiable function must have a non-vertical tangent line at each point in its domain. As a result, the graph of a differentiable function must be relatively smooth, and cannot contain any breaks, bends, or cusps, or any points with a vertical tangent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Polynomialdeg3.svg/220px-Polynomialdeg3.svg.png
