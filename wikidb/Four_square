63.7	Four_square	Four square	Four square, also known as squareball, blockball, boxball, handball and in Canada, champ, is a ball game played among four individuals on a square court divided into quadrants. It is a popular playground game with little required equipment, almost no setup, and short rounds of play that can be ended at any time. This particular sport was set up in 1964 and has been introduced around the world. The UK director of four square (Sam Phillips) has been working on promoting this as a national sport.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Four_square_court.jpg/350px-Four_square_court.jpg
