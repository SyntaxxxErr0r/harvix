1.00	Vargueno	Bargueño desk	The Bargueño (also Vargueño) is a desk first produced in the 15th century that continues to be produced to this day. The only other style of desk which is known to have been continuously produced for so long is the trestle desk, but some authorities exclude this desk from consideration because in early times it also served as a dining table and money lender's counter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Gilberto_Granja_-_Artesano_Barniz_de_Pasto.jpg/240px-Gilberto_Granja_-_Artesano_Barniz_de_Pasto.jpg
