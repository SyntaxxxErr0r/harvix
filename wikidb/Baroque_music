108.3	Baroque_music	Baroque music	Baroque music is the style of Western music extending approximately from 1600 to 1750. This era follows the Renaissance and was followed in turn by the Classical era. The word "baroque" comes from the Portuguese word barroco, meaning "misshapen pearl", a negative description of the ornate and heavily ornamented music of this period; later, the name came to be applied also to its architecture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Ceskystage.jpg/265px-Ceskystage.jpg
