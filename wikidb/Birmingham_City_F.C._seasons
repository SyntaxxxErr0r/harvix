1.01	Birmingham_City_F.C._seasons	List of Birmingham City F.C. seasons	Birmingham City Football Club, an association football club based in Birmingham, England, was founded in 1875 as Small Heath Alliance. For the first thirteen years of their existence, there was no league football, so matches were arranged on an ad hoc basis, supplemented by cup competitions organised at local and national level. Small Heath first entered the FA Cup in the 1881â€“82 season, and won their first trophy, the Walsall Cup, the following season. During the 1880s, they played between 20 and 30 matches each season.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/SmallHeath1893.jpg/300px-SmallHeath1893.jpg
