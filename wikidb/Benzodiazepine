64.6	Benzodiazepine	Benzodiazepine	A benzodiazepine (sometimes colloquially "benzo"; often abbreviated "BZD") is a psychoactive drug whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring. The first benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955, and made available in 1960 by Hoffmannâ€“La Roche, which has also marketed diazepam (Valium) since 1963.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Benzodiazepine_a.svg/152px-Benzodiazepine_a.svg.png
