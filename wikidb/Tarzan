Created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan first appeared in the novel Tarzan of the Apes (magazine publication 1912, book publication 1914), and then in twenty-five sequels, three authorized books by other authors, and innumerable works in other media, authorized or not.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Tarzan_of_the_Apes_in_color.jpg
