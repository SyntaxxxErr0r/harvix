27.23	Boston_Strangler	Boston Strangler	The Boston Strangler is a name attributed to the murderer (or murderers) of several women in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, in the early 1960s. Though the crimes were attributed to Albert DeSalvo, investigators of the case have since suggested the murders (sometimes known as the silk stocking murders) were not committed by one person.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Gainsborough.jpg/180px-Gainsborough.jpg
