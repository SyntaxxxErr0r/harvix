While he plays singles, he is also a doubles player, who partners with friend Rafael Nadal. In 2007 at the Open Seat Open in Barcelona, Spain, Salvà and Nadal made it to the final (on red clay, the surface that Nadal excels on), defeating Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram (both ranked 13) and Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor (both ranked fifth) in straight sets on both occasions. They made it to the finals, but Alexander Waske and Andrei Pavel defeated them 6–3, 7–6 (1).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/P1000203.JPG_%28139267020%29.jpg/150px-P1000203.JPG_%28139267020%29.jpg
