1.00	Folling_disease	Phenylketonuria	Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive metabolic genetic disorder characterized by a mutation in the gene for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), rendering it nonfunctional.:541 This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to the amino acid tyrosine. When PAH activity is reduced, phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylpyruvate (also known as phenylketone), which is detected in the urine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Phenylketonuria_testing.jpg/220px-Phenylketonuria_testing.jpg
