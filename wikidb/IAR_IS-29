1.00	IAR_IS-29	ICA IS-29	The ICA IS-29 was a sailplane built in Romania in the 1970s. The prefix IS comes from Iosif Silimon, the Romanian IAR aeronautical engineer who designed it. The 15-metre (49 feet) single place sister of the IS-28 series, the IS-29D2 single-seater has retractable gear, camber-changing flaps and Hütter type airbrakes on the upper wing surface only. The T-tail has a fixed stabilizer and elevator. The –29D model is of all metal construction while the earlier –29B has wooden wings. Developments include 19 metre (62 ft) -29E2 and 20 m (66 ft) -29E3 versions and a flapless, fixed gear 16.5-metre (54 feet) ‘club’ model -29G.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/IS_29D2.jpeg/300px-IS_29D2.jpeg
