13.06	Marital_rape	Marital rape	Marital rape, also known as spousal rape, is non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. As such, it is a form of partner rape, of domestic violence, and of sexual abuse. Once widely condoned or ignored by law, spousal rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/MaritalRapeCriminalizedMap.svg/300px-MaritalRapeCriminalizedMap.svg.png
