132.7	Chrysler_Building	Chrysler Building	The Chrysler Building is an Art Deco style skyscraper in New York City, located on the east side of Manhattan in the Turtle Bay area at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue. At 1,047 feet (319 m), the structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before it was surpassed by the Empire State Building in 1931. After the destruction of the World Trade Center, it was again the second-tallest building in New York City until December 2007, when the spire was raised on the 1,200 foot (365.8 m) Bank of America Tower, pushing the Chrysler Building into third position. In addition, The New York Times Building, which opened in 2007, is exactly level with the Chrysler Building in height. Both buildings were then pushed into 4th position, when the under construction One World Trade Center surpassed their height.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Chrysler_Building_by_David_Shankbone_Retouched.jpg/250px-Chrysler_Building_by_David_Shankbone_Retouched.jpg
