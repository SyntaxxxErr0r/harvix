8.30	Al-Faluja	Al-Faluja	al-Faluja (Arabic: â€Ž) was an Arab village in the British Mandate for Palestine, located 30 kilometers northeast of Gaza City. The village and the neighbouring village of Iraq al-Manshiyya formed part of the Faluja pocket, where 4,000 Egyptian troops had entered the area as a result of the '48 war, were besieged for four months by the newly established Israel Defense Forces. The 1949 Armistice Agreements allowed for a peaceful transfer of the those areas outside Gaza to Israeli control, allowing Egyptian troops to remain in Gaza. Following the agreements, the Arab residents of the pocket slowly left their homes. The Israeli town of Kiryat Gat, as well as the moshav Revaha, border the site of the former town.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Al_Faluja.jpg/250px-Al_Faluja.jpg
