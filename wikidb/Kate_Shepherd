1.00	Kate_Shepherd	Kate Shepherd	Kate Shepherd (born 1961 in New York City) is an American artist whose work has been shown in galleries and museums since 1996. She is represented by Galerie Lelong in New York City and Paris, Barbara Krakow Gallery in Boston, and Anthony Meier Fine Art in San Francisco. In her unique approach to painting, Shepherd applies thread-like lines of oil paint upon highly saturated layers of enamel. The refined lines suggest a diagrammatic drawing of both recognizable, referential structures, and also more abstracted forms. In every instance the work implies a depth of space, whether shallow or far reaching. Shepherd had a brief architectural training and uses drafting programs to build the painting images.
