1.40	Zinc_shakes	Metal fume fever	Metal fume fever also known as brass founders' ague, brass shakes, zinc shakes, Galvie Flu, or Monday morning fever is an illness caused primarily by exposure to certain fumes. Workers breathe in fumes from chemicals such as zinc oxide (ZnO) or magnesium oxide (MgO), which are themselves created by heating or welding certain metals, particularly galvanized steel. Chromium is also a hazard, from stainless steel. Cadmium, present in some older silver solder alloys can, in extreme cases, cause loss of consciousness within a matter of minutes. Iron itself, and so most simple steels, does not give rise to it.
