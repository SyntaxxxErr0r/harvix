62.1	Aqua_(user_interface)	Aqua (user interface)	Aqua is the GUI and primary visual theme of Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X operating system. It is based around the theme of water, as its name suggests, with droplet-like elements and liberal use of translucency and reflection effects. Steve Jobs noted Aqua's glossy aesthetic: "One of the design goals was when you saw it you wanted to lick it."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/AquaControlsIB.png/400px-AquaControlsIB.png
