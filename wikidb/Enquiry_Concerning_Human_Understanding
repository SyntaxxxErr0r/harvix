It was a revision of an earlier effort, Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, published anonymously in London in 1739â€“40. Hume was disappointed with the reception of the Treatise, which "fell stillborn from the press," as he put it, and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/David_Hume.jpg/150px-David_Hume.jpg
