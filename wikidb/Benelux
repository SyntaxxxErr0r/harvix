57.1	Benelux	Benelux	The Benelux is an economic union in Europe comprising three neighbouring countries, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. These countries are located in northwestern Europe between France and Germany. The Union's name is formed from the beginning of each country's name; it was possibly created for the Benelux Customs Union. However, according to The Economist it was coined somewhat earlierâ€”in August 1946, by that newspaper's correspondent in Belgium. It is now used in a more generic way to refer to the cultural, economic, and geographic grouping.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Flag_of_Benelux.svg/125px-Flag_of_Benelux.svg.png
