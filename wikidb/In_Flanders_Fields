77.8	In_Flanders_Fields	In Flanders Fields	"In Flanders Fields" is a war poem in the form of a rondeau, written during the First World War by Canadian physician and Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae. He was inspired to write it on May 3, 1915, after presiding over the funeral of friend and fellow soldier Alexis Helmer, who died during the Second Battle of Ypres. According to tradition, McCrae was initially unsatisfied with his work and discarded it, only to be retrieved by fellow soldiers. It was first published on December 8 of that year in the London-based magazine Punch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Johnmccraememorialbookcloseup02.JPG/220px-Johnmccraememorialbookcloseup02.JPG
