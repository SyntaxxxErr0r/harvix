206.1	Corporation	Corporation	A corporation is created under the laws of a state as a separate legal entity that has privileges and liabilities that are distinct from those of its members. There are many different forms of corporations, most of which are used to conduct business. Early corporations were established by charter (i.e. by an ad hoc act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Stora_Kopparberg_1288.jpg/220px-Stora_Kopparberg_1288.jpg
