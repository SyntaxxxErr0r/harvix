115.0	Synthesizer	Synthesizer	A sound synthesizer (often abbreviated as "synthesizer" or "synth") is an electronic instrument capable of producing a wide range of sounds. Synthesizers may either imitate other instruments ("imitative synthesis") or generate new timbres. They can be played (controlled) via a variety of different input devices (including keyboards, music sequencers and instrument controllers). Synthesizers generate electric signals (waveforms), and can finally be converted to sound through the loudspeakers or headphones.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/R.A.Moog_minimoog_2.jpg/220px-R.A.Moog_minimoog_2.jpg
