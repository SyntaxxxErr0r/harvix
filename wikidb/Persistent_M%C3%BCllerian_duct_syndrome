1.10	Persistent_M%C3%BCllerian_duct_syndrome	Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome	Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome refers to the presence of a uterus and sometimes other Müllerian duct derivatives in a genetically male animal. In humans, PMDS typically is due to an autosomal recessive congenital disorder and is considered by some to be a form of pseudohermaphroditism due to the presence of uterine tissue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Autorecessive.svg/220px-Autorecessive.svg.png
