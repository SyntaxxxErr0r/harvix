3.00	CARP	CSMA/CARP	In computer networking, Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Avoidance and Resolution using Priorities is a Channel access method. CSMA/CARP is similar in nature to the CSMA/CD Channel access method used in Ethernet networks, but CSMA/CARP provides no detection of network collisions. Instead of detecting network collisions, CSMA/CARP attempts to avoid collisions by using a system of transmission priorities. Again, CSMA/CARP is similar to the functions of the CSMA/CA. However, the /CA (Collision Avoidance) employs a different approach of how to make packets get transmitted over the wire or medium without any difficulties.
