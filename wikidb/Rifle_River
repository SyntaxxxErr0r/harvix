It rises in northeastern Ogemaw County and flows through Arenac County to enter Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron. Once a logging river during the Michigan forestry boom at the turn of the 20th century, the river is now primarily used for recreation, and is a state-designated natural river. It is a popular river for canoeing, with no portages or dams and an average depth of 18 to 24 inches (460 to 610 mm).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Rifle_River_Map_US_MI.svg/288px-Rifle_River_Map_US_MI.svg.png
