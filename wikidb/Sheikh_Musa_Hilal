1.10	Sheikh_Musa_Hilal	Musa Hilal	Musa Hilal was born in 1961. His family exercised tribal leadership of the Arab Mahameed clan in Darfur. He is Sudanese Arab Janjaweed militia leader and adviser to the Sudanese minister of internal affairs. The Janjaweed militia were responsible for a massive military campaign against civilians in Darfur in 2003, as part of a counterinsurgency effort against Darfur rebel groups. On 21 January 2008, the Federal Government of Sudan announced the nomination of Musa Hilal as the chief advisor of the Ministry of Federal Affairs in Sudan. This position allows Mr. Hilal to coordinate with regional leaders surrounding Darfur, as well as with Arab tribal groups, on the relations of the military regime. This political position further permits the military leader power over decisions made in Khartoum pertaining the recruitment of Janjaweed militias.
