2.00	Ground_blizzard	Ground blizzard	Ground blizzard refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. The primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time, but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Ground_blizzard.JPG/300px-Ground_blizzard.JPG
