12.41	Apple_Mail	Mail (application)	Mail (also known as Mail.app or Apple Mail) is an email program included with Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X operating system. Originally developed by NeXT as NeXTMail, a part of their NeXTSTEP operating system, it was adapted, following Apple's acquisition of NeXT, to become OS X's Mail application. Mail uses the SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, and supports Yahoo! Mail, AOL Mail, Gmail, MobileMe and Exchange via IMAP. iOS features a mobile version of Apple Mail with added ActiveSync support, though it is still missing the functionality of attaching files to replay emails. Starting with the version shipped with Mac OS X v10.6, Mail has Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 support using Exchange Web Services.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Mail_Windows.png/250px-Mail_Windows.png
