10.40	Cranborne_Chase	Cranborne Chase	Cranborne Chase (grid reference ) is a chalk plateau in central southern England, straddling the counties Dorset, Hampshire and Wiltshire. The plateau is part of the English Chalk Formation and is adjacent to Salisbury Plain and the West Wiltshire Downs in the north, and the Dorset Downs to the south west. The scarp slope of the hills faces the Blackmore Vale to the west, and to some extent the Vale of Wardour to the north. The chalk gently slopes south and dips under clays and gravels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Dorset_ashmore_01.jpg/220px-Dorset_ashmore_01.jpg
