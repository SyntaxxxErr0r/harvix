69.6	Cider	Cider	Cider or cyder ( -d…ôr) is a fermented alcoholic beverage made from apple juice. Cider varies in alcohol content from 2% abv to 8.5% abv or more in traditional English ciders. In some regions, such as Germany and America, cider may be termed "apple wine". In current usage of the term in the United States and Canada, the term "hard cider" is used for the alcoholic beverage discussed in this article, while the term "cider" usually refers to a non-alcoholic apple juice beverage. When sugar or extra fruit has been added and a secondary fermentation increases the alcoholic strength, a cider is classified as "apple wine" in the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Cider-thatchers.jpg/220px-Cider-thatchers.jpg
