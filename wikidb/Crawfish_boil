6.00	Crawfish_boil	Seafood boil	Shrimp, crab, and crawfish boils can be found across southern Louisiana and Southeast Texas. But it is the crawfish boil that is most closely associated with the region. The Breaux Bridge Crawfish Festival has been named one of the top 10 food events by USA Today and is a showcase for Cajun music and culture. Major crawfish boils are held by churches and other organizations as fundraisers throughout the spring. Tulane University holds an annual "Crawfest" in April, and the University of New Orleans holds an annual crawfish boil for all students at the end of the spring semester (Students unwinding on Crawfish and Unprecedented Funâ€”SUCAUF). Smaller events can be found in backyards and parks throughout April, May, and June. Locals traditionally eat crawfish, as well as crabs, without tools such as shell crackers or picks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/BoiledCrawdads.jpeg/220px-BoiledCrawdads.jpeg
