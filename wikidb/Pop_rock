55.3	Pop_rock	Pop rock	Pop rock is a music genre which mixes a catchy pop style and light lyrics in its (typically) guitar-based rock songs. There are varying definitions of the term, ranging from a slower and mellower form of rock music to a subgenre of pop music. Scholars have noted that pop and rock are usually depicted as opposites; the detractors of pop often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Linda_Hopper_and_Ruthie_Morris_1994_02.jpg/220px-Linda_Hopper_and_Ruthie_Morris_1994_02.jpg
