85.6	Ford_Mustang	Ford Mustang	The Ford Mustang is an automobile manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. It was initially based on the second generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car. Introduced early on April 17, 1964, dubbed as a "1964Â½" model by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A. The model is Ford's third oldest nameplate in production and has undergone several transformations to its current fifth generation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/2010_Ford_Mustang_--_07-18-2009.jpg/250px-2010_Ford_Mustang_--_07-18-2009.jpg
