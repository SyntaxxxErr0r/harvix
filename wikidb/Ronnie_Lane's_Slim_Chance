3.01	Ronnie_Lane's_Slim_Chance	Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance	Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance was the second album done by Ronnie Lane, one of the founders of Small Faces and Faces, after he left the Faces to live on a farm in Shropshire. In homage to his perceived chances of commercial success, he named his band Slim Chance. Most songs on this album were written by Lane, the rest of Slim Chance, and Kate Lambert, his wife. Haunting, profound, and witty, the album did not exceed his commercial expectations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/Ronnie_Lane_Slim_Chance.jpg/220px-Ronnie_Lane_Slim_Chance.jpg
