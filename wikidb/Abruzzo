77.7	Abruzzo	Abruzzo	Abruzzo is a region in Italy, its western border lying less than 50 miles (80 km) due east of Rome. Abruzzo borders the region of Marche to the north, Lazio to the west and south-west, Molise to the south-east, and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Although it is geographically more of a central than southern region, ISTAT (the Italian statistical authority) considers it part of Southern Italy, a vestige of Abruzzo's historic association with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Abruzzo_bandiera.svg/100px-Abruzzo_bandiera.svg.png
