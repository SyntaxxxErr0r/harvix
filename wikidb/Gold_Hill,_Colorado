8.41	Gold_Hill,_Colorado	Gold Hill, Colorado	Gold Hill is a census-designated place (CDP) in Boulder County, Colorado, United States. The population was 230 at the 2010 census. This settlement is located to the northwest of Boulder, perched on a mountainside above Left Hand Canyon at an elevation of 8,300 feet. Originally a mining camp, it was the site of the first major discovery of gold during the 1859 Colorado Gold Rush and remained an important mining camp throughout the late 19th century, with a population approaching 1500 at its height, before falling into decline. It has been revived somewhat in recent years as a quiet isolated haven, with no paved streets, but easily accessed by dirt roads. The town contains numerous historic wooden structures, some restored in recent years, as well decaying ruins from its mining heyday. It has a small museum and two-room schoolhouse, the Gold Hill School, which since 1873 has been the oldest continuously operating public school in Colorado. Other businesses include a General Store and a restored inn listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town is laid out on a small grid of dirt streets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Gold_Hill_Historic_District_Gold_Hill_CO.jpg/250px-Gold_Hill_Historic_District_Gold_Hill_CO.jpg
