1.00	Lehigh_Valley_Xtreme	United Hockey League	The United Hockey League (UHL) was a low-level professional ice hockey league (self-described as AA, although professional hockey does not use letter designations for league levels), with teams in the United States. The UHL, in general, was equal to the ECHL in on-ice skill level and players often moved back and forth between the leagues; however, UHL franchises were much less valuable than ECHL franchises and were generally not profitable, with franchises folding mid-season on several occasions. The league was headquartered in Rochester, Michigan prior to its 2010 merger with the Central Hockey League, and in its last year, consisted of seven teams.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9b/United_Hockey_League.svg/150px-United_Hockey_League.svg.png
