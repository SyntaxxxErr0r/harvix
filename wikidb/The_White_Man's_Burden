88.8	The_White_Man's_Burden	The White Man's Burden	"The White Man's Burden" is a poem by the English poet Rudyard Kipling. It was originally published in the popular magazine McClure's in 1899, with the subtitle The United States and the Philippine Islands. Although Kipling's poem mixed exhortation to empire with somber warnings of the costs involved, imperialists within the United States understood the phrase "white man's burden" as a characterization for imperialism that justified the policy as a noble enterprise.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/The_white_mans_burden.gif/250px-The_white_mans_burden.gif
