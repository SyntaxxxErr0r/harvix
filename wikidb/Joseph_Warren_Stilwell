1.10	Joseph_Warren_Stilwell	Joseph Stilwell	General Joseph Warren Stilwell (March 19, 1883 â€“ October 12, 1946) was a United States Army four-star General known for service in the China Burma India Theater. His caustic personality was reflected in the nickname "Vinegar Joe". Although distrustful of his allies Stilwell showed himself to be a capable and daring tactician in the field but a lack of resources meant he was forced continually to improvise. He famously differed as to strategy, ground troops versus air power, with his subordinate, Claire Chennault, who had the ear of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. George Marshall acknowledged he had given Stilwell "one of the most difficult" assignments of any theater commander.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/2WWstilwell.JPG
