1.20	Symfonia	Symfonia	Symfonia was a power metal supergroup formed in 2010 by André Matos, Timo Tolkki, Jari Kainulainen, Mikko Härkin and Uli Kusch. On February 18 of 2011, the band made its debut performance at Finnish Metal Expo. The band released its debut album In Paradisum in March 2011. By October 2011 last news were that drummer Uli Kusch officially left the band to continue recovering from his nerve damage which makes impossible for him to play drums for a year. The band did a tour in South America (mostly in Brazil) and would start to record a new album subsequently. By December 2011, Timo Tolkki announced in his official Facebook page that he will probably never record again. In his long text, Timo cited some problems during the recording and touring of the first Symfonia album. Symfonia's homepage has since been replaced with a big red square with the verse "the key to the universe is love", which appears at the song "Key to the Universe" from Tolkki's solo album Hymn to Life. In a post at Symfonia's official forum Timo Tolkki stated that "ending the Symfonia as it is, was a rational decision based on both the opinions of me and Andre Matos and the hard evidence or facts.", thus confirming that the band is no more.
