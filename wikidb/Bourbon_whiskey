64.7	Bourbon_whiskey	Bourbon whiskey	Bourbon is a type of American whiskey â€“ a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn. The name of the spirit derives from its historical association with an area known as Old Bourbon, around what is now Bourbon County, Kentucky (which, in turn, was named after the French House of Bourbon royal family). It has been produced since the 18th century. While it may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South in general, and Kentucky in particular.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/DecaturBourbons.jpg/250px-DecaturBourbons.jpg
