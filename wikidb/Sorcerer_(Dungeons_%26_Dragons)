3.00	Sorcerer_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)	Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)	The sorcerer is a playable character class in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy role-playing game. A sorcerer is weak in melee combat, but a master of arcane magic, the most generally powerful form of D&amp;D magic. Sorcerers' magical ability is innate rather than studied. In the words of the 3.5 Player's Handbook: "Sorcerers create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice."
