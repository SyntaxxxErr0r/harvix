1.00	Six4one	six4one	six4one is a six-piece musical group formed in November 2005 for the sole purpose of representing Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The group is made up of six individuals who were chosen at a casting session, which took place from November 25â€“27, 2005. The group were not created as a long-term manufactured band, but instead as "six strong voices" who could collaborate at the contest, and then go their separate ways after the final.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/ff/Six4one.PNG/280px-Six4one.PNG
