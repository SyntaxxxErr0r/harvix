166.8	History_of_the_Internet	History of the Internet	The history of the Internet began with the development of computers in the 1950s. This began with point-to-point communication between mainframe computers and terminals, expanded to point-to-point connections between computers and then early research into packet switching. Packet switched networks such as ARPANET, Mark I at NPL in the UK, CYCLADES, Merit Network, Tymnet, and Telenet, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols. The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking, where multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Leonard-Kleinrock-and-IMP1.png/200px-Leonard-Kleinrock-and-IMP1.png
