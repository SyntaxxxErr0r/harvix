85.1	Industrial_music	Industrial music	Industrial music is a style of experimental music that draws on transgressive and provocative themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by the band Throbbing Gristle, and the creation of the slogan "industrial music for industrial people". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. Allmusic defines industrial as the "most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music"; "initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concr√®te, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Frank_Zappa_-_Capt._Beefheart.jpg/125px-Frank_Zappa_-_Capt._Beefheart.jpg
