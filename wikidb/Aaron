55.1	Aaron	Aaron	In the Hebrew Bible and the Qur'an, Aaron ( or ; Hebrew: ‎ Ahărōn, Arabic: ‎ Hārūn, Greek : Ααρών ), who is often called "'Aaron the Priest"' () and once Aaron the Levite () (Exodus 4:14), was the older brother of Moses, (Exodus 6:16-20; Qur'an 28:34) and a prophet of God. He represented the priestly functions of his tribe, becoming the first High Priest of the Israelites. While Moses was receiving his education at the Egyptian royal court, and during his exile among the Midianites, Aaron and his sister Miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen). There, Aaron gained a name for eloquent and persuasive speech, so that when the time came for the demand upon the Pharaoh to release Israel from captivity, Aaron became his brother’s nabi, or spokesman, to his own people (Exodus 7:1) and, after their unwillingness to hear, to the Pharaoh himself (Exodus 7:9). Various dates for his life have been proposed, ranging from approximately 1600 to 1200 BC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/DD_Frauenkirche_Aaron.jpg/250px-DD_Frauenkirche_Aaron.jpg
