116.0	DARPA_Grand_Challenge	DARPA Grand Challenge	The DARPA Grand Challenge is a prize competition for driverless vehicles, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the most prominent research organization of the United States Department of Defense. Congress has authorized DARPA to award cash prizes to further DARPA's mission to sponsor revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and military use. DARPA has technologies needed to create the first fully autonomous ground vehicles capable of completing a substantial off-road course within a limited time. The third event, The DARPA Urban Challenge, which took place on November 3, 2007 and was broadcast via webcast, further advanced vehicle requirements to include autonomous operation in a mock urban environment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/DesertToCity.jpg/300px-DesertToCity.jpg
