2.10	Light_utility_vehicle	Light Utility Vehicle	The Willys MB US Army Jeep of World War II is the most widely known vehicle of this class. Over 640,000 Jeeps were built for World War II, and they inspired many vehicles similar in layout, or function. The M38A1 Jeep was used in the Korean War. It was followed by the Vietnam-era M151 MUTT, which was designed by Ford. By the mid-1980s, this role would be taken over by the larger Humvee, which would be used as a combat vehicle in Iraq. The US also purchased Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicles based on commercially available light trucks. US forces are currently defining the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle which would be designed to be armored from the outset, with the smallest 4-person payload capacity class corresponding to the traditional jeep role.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Covered_Willy%27s_jeep_Wings_Over_Wine_Country_2007.JPG/220px-Covered_Willy%27s_jeep_Wings_Over_Wine_Country_2007.JPG
