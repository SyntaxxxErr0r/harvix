3.00	Forum_des_Halles	Les Halles	Les Halles ( ) is an area of Paris, France, located in the 1er arrondissement, just south of the fashionable rue Montorgueil. It is named for the large central wholesale marketplace, which was demolished in 1971, to be replaced with an underground modern shopping precinct, the Forum des Halles. It is notable in that the open air center area is below street level, like a sunken garden, and contains sculptures, fountains, and mosaics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/RuePierreLescot.JPG/200px-RuePierreLescot.JPG
