45.38	Pope_Joan	Pope Joan	Pope Joan was a legendary female Pope who allegedly reigned for a few years some time during the Middle Ages. The story first appeared in 13th-century chronicles, and subsequently spread and embellished throughout Europe. It was widely believed for centuries, though modern religious scholars consider it fictitious, perhaps deriving from historicized folklore regarding Roman monuments or from anti-papal satire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Boccacio_De_Ioanne_Anglica_Papa.png/220px-Boccacio_De_Ioanne_Anglica_Papa.png
