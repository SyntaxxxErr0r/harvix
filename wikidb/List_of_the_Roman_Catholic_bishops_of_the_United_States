1.01	List_of_the_Roman_Catholic_bishops_of_the_United_States	List of the Catholic bishops of the United States	The following is a List of Lists of groups within the Roman Catholic Church in America. By combining lists of bishops from each of the groupings, one may create a single List of the Catholic bishops of the United States, including the five overseas dependencies of the U.S. The Catholic Church in the United States comprises 177 Latin-rite dioceses and 17 Eastern Catholic eparchies led by diocesan bishops or eparchs, plus an apostolic exarchate, the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA, and the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter. Dioceses led by archbishops are called archdioceses. In most archdioceses and some large dioceses, one or more auxiliary bishops serve in association with the diocesan bishop. There are thirty-two Latin-rite and two Eastern Catholic archbishops who serve as metropolitan archbishops of their respective Latin-rite ecclesiastical provinces or Eastern Catholic metropoliae. (One archbishop — that of the Archdiocese for the Military Services — is not a metropolitan.) As of February 2012, five of these metropolitans are cardinals of the Catholic Church.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/US_Roman_Catholic_dioceses_map.png/350px-US_Roman_Catholic_dioceses_map.png
