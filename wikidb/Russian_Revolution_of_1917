63.7	Russian_Revolution_of_1917	Russian Revolution	The Russian Revolution is the collective term for a series of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which destroyed the Tsarist autocracy and led to the creation of the Soviet Union. The Tsar was deposed and replaced by a provisional government in the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time). In the second revolution, during October, the Provisional Government was removed and replaced with a Bolshevik government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.jpg/300px-Russian_Revolution_of_1917.jpg
