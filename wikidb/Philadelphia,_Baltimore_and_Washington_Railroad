1.00	Philadelphia,_Baltimore_and_Washington_Railroad	Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad	The Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad (PB&amp;W) was a railroad that operated in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and the District of Columbia in the 20th century was a key component of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) system. Its 131 mile (211 km) main line ran from Philadelphia to Washington.:228 The PB&amp;W main line is currently known as a portion of the Northeast Corridor, owned by Amtrak. On April 2, 1956, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad was merged into the PB&amp;W by the corporate parent of both lines, the Pennsylvania Railroad. This expanded the "official" reach of the PB&amp;W into several additional states, though from a marketing standpoint the result of this combination was transparent to most railroad customers and to the overall general public.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Philadelphia-broadst-138288pv-bis.jpg/200px-Philadelphia-broadst-138288pv-bis.jpg
