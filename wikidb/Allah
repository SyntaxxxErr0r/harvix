154.9	Allah	Allah	The term Allāh is derived from a contraction of the Arabic definite article al- "the" and "deity, god" to meaning "the deity, God" (, ho theos monos). Cognates of the name "Allāh" exist in other Semitic languages, including Hebrew and Aramaic. Biblical Hebrew mostly uses the plural form (but functional singular) Elohim. The corresponding Aramaic form is in Biblical Aramaic and in Syriac as used by the Assyrian Church, both meaning simply "God". In the Sikh scriptures, Guru Granth Sahib, the term Allah (Punjabi: ) is used 46 times respectively.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Allah-eser-green.png/220px-Allah-eser-green.png
