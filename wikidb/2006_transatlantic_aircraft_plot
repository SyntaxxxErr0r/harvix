The plot was discovered and foiled by British police before it could be carried out and, as a result, unprecedented security measures were immediately put in place.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/2006-08-10_police_raid_walthamstow_london_uk-NOISEedit.jpg/190px-2006-08-10_police_raid_walthamstow_london_uk-NOISEedit.jpg
