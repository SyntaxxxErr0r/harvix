1.00	Cavernous_lymphangioma	Cystic hygroma	A cystic hygroma is a congenital multiloculated lymphatic lesion that can arise anywhere, but is classically found in the left posterior triangle of the neck. This is the most common form of lymphangioma. It contains large cyst like cavities containing watery fluid. Microscopically cystic hygroma consists of multiple locules filled with lymph. In the depth the locules are quite big but they decrease in size towards the surface.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Lymphangioma.jpg/230px-Lymphangioma.jpg
