80.7	Medusa	Medusa	In Greek mythology Medusa (Greek: ), "guardian, protectress") was a Gorgon, a chthonic monster, and a daughter of Phorcys and Ceto. The author Hyginus, (Fabulae, 151) interposes a generation and gives Medusa another chthonic pair as parents. Gazing directly upon her would turn onlookers to stone. She was beheaded by the hero Perseus, who thereafter used her head as a weapon until he gave it to the goddess Athena to place on her shield. In classical antiquity the image of the head of Medusa appeared in the evil-averting device known as the Gorgoneion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Medusa_by_Carvaggio.jpg/200px-Medusa_by_Carvaggio.jpg
