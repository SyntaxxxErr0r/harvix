1.10	Peter_Rindisbacher	Peter Rindisbacher	Peter Rindisbacher (12 April 1806 â€“ 12 August or 13 August 1834) was a North American artist who specialized in watercolors and illustrations dealing with First Nation tribes of mid-Western Canada and the United States, mostly depictions of the Anishinaabe, Cree, and Sioux, usually in group action or genre scenes. He seldom did individual portraits; however, he painted himself into a few interior tipi scenes, usually smoking a pipe. He commonly referred to the tipis as tents, such as in the title, Inside a Skin Tent.
