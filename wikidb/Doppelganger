51.1	Doppelganger	Doppelg채nger	The word also is used to describe the sensation of having glimpsed oneself in peripheral vision, in a position where there is no chance that it could have been a reflection. Doppelg채ngers often are perceived as a sinister form of bilocation and are regarded by some to be harbingers of bad luck. In some traditions, a doppelg채nger seen by a person's friends or relatives portends illness or danger, while seeing one's own doppelg채nger is an omen of death.
