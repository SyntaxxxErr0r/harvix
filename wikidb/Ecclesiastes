57.5	Ecclesiastes	Ecclesiastes	The Book of Ecclesiastes (Greek: Ἐκκλησιαστής), originally called Qoheleth (Hebrew: ‎‎, literally, "Preacher") in Hebrew, is a book of the Tanakh's Ketuvim and the Old Testament. The literal sense of the Greek translation, "Member of the Assembly," approaches "Preacher," using the root ekklesia for "assembly," or "church," to maintain similarity with Qoheleth. In English, the book is commonly referred to simply as Ecclesiastes (abbreviated "Ecc.").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Aleppo_Codex_Joshua_1_1.jpg/170px-Aleppo_Codex_Joshua_1_1.jpg
