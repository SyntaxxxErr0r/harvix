7.20	Datsun_200B	Datsun 200B	The Datsun 200B is an Australian-market mid-size car sold from 1977 to 1981. Continuing with the Japanese styling, the first 200B's were all fully imported in sedan, station wagon and coupe, the latter retaining the SSS badge. In January 1978 local assembly began for the sedan, followed shortly by the wagon. The sedan trim levels were GL and GX, while the coupe remained as a hardtop, however unlike the previous model, Datsun added an opera window in the rear pillar. The coupe was discontinued in Australia in 1979.
