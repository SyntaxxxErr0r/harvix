4.01	Communion_(film)	Communion (1989 film)	Communion is a 1989 drama/thriller film based on the book of the same name by Whitley Strieber. Starring Christopher Walken and Frances Sternhagen, it tells a story of a family that experiences the extraterrestrial phenomenon while on vacation at a remote vacation home in the wilderness. According to Strieber, the story is a real-life account of his own encounter with "visitors", with Walken playing the role of the author. The score was composed by Eric Clapton. It received a mostly negative critical reaction due to Walken's performance and was panned by Strieber himself due to its non factual portrayal of him.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a3/CommunionPoster.jpg
