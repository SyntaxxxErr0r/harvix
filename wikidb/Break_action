4.00	Break_action	Break-action	A break-action firearm is one whose barrels are hinged, and rotate perpendicular to the bore axis to expose the breech and allow loading and unloading of ammunition. A separate operation may be required for the cocking of a hammer to fire the new round. Break open actions are universal in double-barrelled shotguns, double-barrelled rifles and combination guns, and are also common in single shot rifles, pistols, and shotguns, and can also be found in flare guns, grenade launchers, air guns and some older revolver designs. They are also known as break-open, break-barrel, break top, or (on old revolvers) top-break actions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/ShotgunAction.JPG/220px-ShotgunAction.JPG
