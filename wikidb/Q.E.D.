89.4	Q.E.D.	Q.E.D.	Q.E.D. is an initialism of the Latin phrase , which translates as "which was to be demonstrated" or "as was to be expected". The phrase is traditionally placed in its abbreviated form at the end of a mathematical proof or philosophical argument when what was specified in the enunciation — and in the setting-out — has been exactly restated as the conclusion of the demonstration. The abbreviation thus signals the completion of the proof.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Philippe_van_Lansberge_1604_QED.png/400px-Philippe_van_Lansberge_1604_QED.png
