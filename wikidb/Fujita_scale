52.7	Fujita_scale	Fujita scale	The Fujita scale , or Fujita-Pearson scale, is a scale for rating tornado intensity, based primarily on the damage tornadoes inflict on human-built structures and vegetation. The official Fujita scale category is determined by meteorologists (and engineers) after a ground and/or aerial damage survey; and depending on the circumstances, ground-swirl patterns (cycloidal marks), radar tracking, eyewitness testimonies, media reports and damage imagery, as well as photogrammetry/videogrammetry if motion picture recording is available.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Fujita_scale_technical.svg/300px-Fujita_scale_technical.svg.png
