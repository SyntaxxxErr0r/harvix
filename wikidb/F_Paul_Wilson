2.20	F_Paul_Wilson	F. Paul Wilson	Francis Paul Wilson (b. May 17, 1946 in Jersey City) is an American author, primarily in the science fiction and horror genres. His debut novel was Healer (1976). Wilson is also a part-time practicing family physician. He made his first sales in 1970 to Analog while still in medical school (graduating in 1973), and continued to write science fiction throughout the seventies. In 1981 he ventured into the horror genre with the international bestseller, The Keep, and helped define the field throughout the rest of the decade. In the 1990s he became a true genre hopper, moving from science fiction to horror to medical thrillers and branching into interactive scripting for Disney Interactive and other multimedia companies. He, along with Matthew J. Costello, created and scripted FTL Newsfeed which ran daily on the Sci-Fi Channel from 1992-1996.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Wilson%2C_F_Paul_%282007%29_crop.jpg/220px-Wilson%2C_F_Paul_%282007%29_crop.jpg
