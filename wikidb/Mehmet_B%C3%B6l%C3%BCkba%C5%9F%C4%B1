Sebatspor youth academy. Journeyman Mehmet spent most of his professional career with the UEFA Cup winner Galatasaray after being discovered by Fatih Terim while playing in the third division. He directly found a place in first eleven, however, with the arrival of Cláudio Taffarel he could never get the chance to play regularly. He was capped for the Turkish U21 team in 1998. When he became the third choice goalkeeper for Galatasaray, he left for İstanbulspor where his career went further down. After playing for several Anatolian sides, he returned to İstanbulspor in January 2008.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/Replace_this_image_male.svg/150px-Replace_this_image_male.svg.png
