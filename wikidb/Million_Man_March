52.1	Million_Man_March	Million Man March	The Million Man March was a gathering of social activists, en masse, held on and around the National Mall in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1995. The Nation of Islam, working in conjunction with scores of civil rights organizations including many local chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (but not the national NAACP) and the National African American Leadership Summit, a leading group of civil rights activists formed the Million Man March Organizing Committee. The committee invited many prominent speakers to address the audience, and Louis Farrakhan delivered the keynote address. African American men from across the United States converged on Washington in an effort to “convey to the world a vastly different picture of the Black male” and to unite in self-help and self-defense against economic and social ills plaguing the African American community.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/The_million_march_man.jpg/300px-The_million_march_man.jpg
