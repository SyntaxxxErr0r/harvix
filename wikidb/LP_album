54.4	LP_album	LP record	The LP , or long-playing microgroove record, is a format for phonograph (gramophone) records, an analog sound storage medium. Introduced by Columbia Records in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound capability, it has remained the standard format for vinyl "albums" up to the present.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Vynil_vinil_92837841.png/220px-Vynil_vinil_92837841.png
