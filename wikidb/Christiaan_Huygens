81.6	Christiaan_Huygens	Christiaan Huygens	Huygens achieved note for his argument that light consists of waves, now known as the Huygensâ€“Fresnel principle, which two centuries later became instrumental in the understanding of wave-particle duality. He generally receives credit for his discovery of the centrifugal force, the laws for collision of bodies, for his role in the development of modern calculus and his original observations on sound perception (see repetition pitch). Huygens is seen as the first theoretical physicist as he was the first to use formulae in physics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Christiaan_Huygens-painting.jpeg/200px-Christiaan_Huygens-painting.jpeg
