62.3	Gingivitis	Gingivitis	Gingivitis ("inflammation of the gum tissue") is a term used to describe non-destructive periodontal disease. The most common form of gingivitis is in response to bacterial biofilms (also called plaque) adherent to tooth surfaces, termed plaque-induced gingivitis, and is the most common form of periodontal disease. In the absence of treatment, gingivitis may progress to periodontitis, which is a destructive form of periodontal disease.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Gingivitis_before_and_after-2.jpg/230px-Gingivitis_before_and_after-2.jpg
