59.1	Sewing	Sewing	Sewing is the craft of fastening or attaching objects using stitches made with a needle and thread. Sewing is one of the oldest of the textile arts, arising in the Paleolithic era. Before the discovery of spinning yarn or weaving fabric, archaeologists believe Stone Age people across Europe and Asia sewed fur and skin clothing using bone, antler or ivory needles and "thread" made of various animal body parts including sinew, catgut, and veins.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Syende_fiskerpige.jpeg/220px-Syende_fiskerpige.jpeg
