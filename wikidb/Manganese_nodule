20.42	Manganese_nodule	Manganese nodule	Nodules vary in size from tiny particles visible only under a microscope to large pellets more than 20 centimetres (8 in) across. However, most nodules are between 5 and 10 cm (2 and 4 in) in diameter, about the size of potatoes. Their surface is generally smooth, sometimes rough, mammilated (knobby) or otherwise irregular. The bottom, buried in sediment, is generally rougher than the top.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Manganknolle.jpg/220px-Manganknolle.jpg
