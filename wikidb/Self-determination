77.0	Self-determination	Self-determination	Self-determination is the principle in international law that nations have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no external compulsion or external interference. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, or what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or even full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations should be â€” or even what constitutes a nation. In fact, there are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination. Moreover, self-determination is just one of many principles applied to determining international borders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Decolonization_-_World_In_1945_en.svg/500px-Decolonization_-_World_In_1945_en.svg.png
