6.71	Finite_state_automata	Finite-state machine	A finite-state machine or finite-state automaton (plural: automata), or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model used to design computer programs and digital logic circuits. It is conceived as an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states. The machine is in only one state at a time; the state it is in at any given time is called the current state. It can change from one state to another when initiated by a triggering event or condition, this is called a transition. A particular FSM is defined by a list of the possible transition states from each current state, and the triggering condition for each transition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/UML_state_machine_Fig5.png/250px-UML_state_machine_Fig5.png
