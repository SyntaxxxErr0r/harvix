1.00	Like_A_Boss	Like a Boss	"Like a Boss" is the tenth track and fourth single from The Lonely Island's debut album Incredibad. The song is a parody of the first official single from Slim Thug's first album Already Platinum, also named 'Like a Boss'. Lonely Island writer Andy Samberg revealed in an interview with NME that the content of the song, whilst parodying Slim Thug's song of the same title, drew from his experiences of a senior manager from his time working at Los Angeles law firm, PV Legal.
