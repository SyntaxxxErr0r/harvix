1.00	%E4%B8%B9%E4%B8%9C	Dandong	Dandong , previously known as Andong and Antung, is a city in Liaoning Province, Northeast China. It lies on the border between China and North Korea, which is marked by the Yalu River, and is the largest border city in China. Also, to the southwest of the city, the river flows into Korea Bay. The city has therefore had a dynamic history because of its strategic location for the northeast's rich natural resources and because of its convenient access to the ocean.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Dandong%2C_Liaoning_Province.jpg/250px-Dandong%2C_Liaoning_Province.jpg
