87.9	Free_will	Free will	Free will is the ability of agents to make choices free from certain kinds of constraints. The existence of free will and its exact nature and definition have long been debated in philosophy. Historically, the constraint of dominant concern has been the metaphysical constraint of determinism. Two prominent opposing positions within that debate are metaphysical libertarianism, the claim that determinism is false and thus that free will exists (or is at least possible); and hard determinism, the claim that determinism is true and thus that free will does not exist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Toppledominos.jpg/220px-Toppledominos.jpg
