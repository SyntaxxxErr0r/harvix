1.00	-thiol	Thiol	In organic chemistry, a thiol ( ) is an organosulfur compound that contains a carbon-bonded sulfhydryl (–C–SH or R–SH) group (where R represents an alkane, alkene, or other carbon-containing group of atoms). Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of an alcohol), and the word is a portmanteau of "thio" + "alcohol," with the first word deriving from Greek θεῖον ("thion") = "sulfur". note 1 The –SH functional group itself is referred to as either a thiol group or a sulfhydryl group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Mercapto_Group_General_Formulae.png/120px-Mercapto_Group_General_Formulae.png
