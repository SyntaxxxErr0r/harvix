51.3	Rioja_(wine)	Rioja (wine)	Rioja is a wine, with Denominación de Origen Calificada (D.O.C. Qualified designation of origin) named after La Rioja, in Spain. Rioja is made from grapes grown not only in the Autonomous Community of La Rioja, but also in parts of Navarre and the Basque province of Álava. Rioja is further subdivided into three zones: Rioja Alta, Rioja Baja and Rioja Alavesa. Many wines have traditionally blended fruit from all three regions though there is a slow growth in single zone wines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Rioja_vineyards.JPG/220px-Rioja_vineyards.JPG
