66.4	Anton_Bruckner	Anton Bruckner	Anton Bruckner (4 September 1824) â€“ 11 October 1896)) was an Austrian composer known for his symphonies, masses, and motets. The first are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German Romanticism because of their rich harmonic language, strongly polyphonic character, and considerable length. Bruckner's compositions helped to define contemporary musical radicalism, owing to their dissonances, unprepared modulations, and roving harmonies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Anton_Bruckner.jpg/250px-Anton_Bruckner.jpg
