119.2	Intelligent_dance_music	Intelligent dance music	Intelligent dance music (commonly IDM or intelligent dance) is a term that describes an electronic music genre that emerged in the early 1990s. The genre is influenced by a wide range of musical styles particularly electronic dance music (EDM) such as Detroit Techno. Stylistically, IDM tends to rely upon individualistic experimentation rather than on a particular set of musical characteristics. The range of post-techno styles to emerge in the early 1990s were described variously as art techno, ambient techno, intelligent techno, and electronica. In the United States, the latter term is now used by the music industry as a catchall to describe EDM and its many derivatives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Autechre1.jpg/220px-Autechre1.jpg
