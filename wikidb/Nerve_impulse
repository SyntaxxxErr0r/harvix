7.12	Nerve_impulse	Action potential	All cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized â€” in other words, they maintain a voltage difference across the cell's plasma membrane, known as the membrane potential. This electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between protein structures embedded in the membrane called ion pumps and ion channels. In neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell, giving the dendrites, axon, and cell body different electrical properties. As a result, some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials), whereas others are not. The most excitable part of a neuron is usually the axon hillock (the point where the axon leaves the cell body), but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Action_potential_vert.png/300px-Action_potential_vert.png
