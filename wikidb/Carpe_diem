107.4	Carpe_diem	Carpe diem	Carpe diem is a phrase from a Latin poem by Horace (see "Source" section below) that has become an aphorism. It is popularly translated as "seize the day". Carpe literally means "to pick, pluck, pluck off, cull, crop, gather", but Ovid used the word in the sense of, "to enjoy, seize, use, make use of".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Yvoire_cadran_solaire.jpg/220px-Yvoire_cadran_solaire.jpg
