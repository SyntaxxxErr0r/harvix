133.0	Military	Military	A military is an organization authorized by its greater society to use lethal force, usually including use of weapons, in defending its country by combating actual or perceived threats. The military may have additional functions of use to its greater society, such as advancing a political agenda e.g. communism during cold war era, supporting or promoting economic expansion through imperialism, and as a form of internal social control. As an adjective the term "military" is also used to refer to any property or aspect of a military. Militaries often function as societies within societies, by having their own military communities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Praetorian_GuardSoldiers_basrelief_cropped.jpg/220px-Praetorian_GuardSoldiers_basrelief_cropped.jpg
