Alonso de Sotomayor went to Peru on July 30, 1592 to petition the viceroy there for more men leaving Pedro de Viscarra with the title of lieutenant governor of Chile. Upon the arrival of Martín García Óñez de Loyola on 23 September 1592 to replace Sotomayor, Viscarra relinquished his office.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Qui%C3%B1ones%2C_O%C3%B1es_de_Loyola_y_Viscarra.JPG/220px-Qui%C3%B1ones%2C_O%C3%B1es_de_Loyola_y_Viscarra.JPG
