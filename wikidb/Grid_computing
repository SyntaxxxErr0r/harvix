319.2	Grid_computing	Grid computing	Grid computing is a term referring to the federation of computer resources from multiple administrative domains to reach a common goal. The grid can be thought of as a distributed system with non-interactive workloads that involve a large number of files. What distinguishes grid computing from conventional high performance computing systems such as cluster computing is that grids tend to be more loosely coupled, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed. Although a grid can be dedicated to a specialized application, it is more common that a single grid will be used for a variety of different purposes. Grids are often constructed with the aid of general-purpose grid software libraries known as middleware.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/AmdahlsLaw.svg/200px-AmdahlsLaw.svg.png
