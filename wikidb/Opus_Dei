60.1	Opus_Dei	Opus Dei	Opus Dei, formally known as The Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei (Latin: ), is an organization of the Catholic Church that teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity. The majority of its membership are lay people, with secular priests under the governance of a prelate (bishop) elected by specific members and appointed by the Pope. Opus Dei is Latin for Work of God; hence the organization is often referred to by members and supporters as the Work.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Opus_Dei_cross.svg/200px-Opus_Dei_cross.svg.png
