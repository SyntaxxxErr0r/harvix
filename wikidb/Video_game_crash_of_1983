42.40	Video_game_crash_of_1983	North American video game crash of 1983	The North American video game crash was a massive contraction of the video game industry that occurred from 1983 to 1985. Revenues that had peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983 fell to around $100 million—a drop of almost 97 percent—by 1985. The crash was a serious event that brought an abrupt end to what is considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America. The crash almost destroyed the then-fledgling industry and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles in North America. It lasted about two years, and many business analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles. The video-game industry was revitalized a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), which was released in North America in 1985 and had become extremely popular by 1987.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Video_game_history_icon.svg/100px-Video_game_history_icon.svg.png
