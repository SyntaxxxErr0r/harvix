114.6	Anthropocene	Anthropocene	The Anthropocene is a recent and informal geologic chronological term that serves to mark the evidence and extent of human activities that have had a significant global impact on the Earth's ecosystems. The term was coined by ecologist Eugene F. Stoermer but has been widely popularized by the Nobel Prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen, who regards the influence of human behavior on the Earth's atmosphere in recent centuries as so significant as to constitute a new geological era for its lithosphere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Earthlights_dmsp.jpg/220px-Earthlights_dmsp.jpg
