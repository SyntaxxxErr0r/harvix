It did not achieve its present name until the late 19th century and it now advocates secular humanism and is a member of the International Humanist and Ethical Union.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Conway_Hall_South_Place_Ethical_Society_night.jpg/220px-Conway_Hall_South_Place_Ethical_Society_night.jpg
