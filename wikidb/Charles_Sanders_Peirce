Peirce was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, and semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism. In 1934, the philosopher Paul Weiss called Peirce "the most original and versatile of American philosophers and America's greatest logician".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Charles_Sanders_Peirce.jpg/200px-Charles_Sanders_Peirce.jpg
