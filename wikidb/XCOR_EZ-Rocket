2.21	XCOR_EZ-Rocket	XCOR EZ-Rocket	The XCOR EZ-Rocket is a test platform for the XCOR rocket propulsion system. The plane is a modified Rutan Long-EZ, with the propeller replaced by first one, then a pair of pressure-fed regeneratively cooled liquid-fuelled rocket engines and an underslung rocket-fuel tank. The engines are restartable in flight, and are contained within Kevlar armour shielding for safety reasons. The EZ-Rocket is registered as an experimental aircraft.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Xcor-ezrocket-N132EZ-020627-02.jpg/220px-Xcor-ezrocket-N132EZ-020627-02.jpg
