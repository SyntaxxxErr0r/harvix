1.10	Chavuma	Chavuma	Chavuma is a town in North Western Zambia, lying immediately south of the border with Angola. It lies on the Zambezi River and the M8 road. Local attractions include the Chavuma Falls, while a market takes place on the border, permitting people from both nations to trade. Chavuma has a population of fewer than 25,000 mostly from the Luvale people. Most are subsistence farmers and fishermen. The Chavuma area has rich traditions, including the Makishi dancers, Mwali, and Chilende. With relative peace in Angola there is a lot of cross border trade. Chavuma also has an American mission school and hospital (Christian Mission in Many Lands) that was built in the 1900s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/ZM-Chavuma.png/225px-ZM-Chavuma.png
