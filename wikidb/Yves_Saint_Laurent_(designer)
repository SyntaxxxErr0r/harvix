In 1985, Caroline Rennolds Milbank wrote, "The most consistently celebrated and influential designer of the past twenty-five years, Yves Saint Laurent can be credited with both spurring the couture's rise from its sixties ashes and with finally rendering ready-to-wear reputable." He is also credited with having introduced the tuxedo suit for women, became the first designer to use ethnic models in his runway shows, and referenced other non-European cultures in his work.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Study_of_Yves_Saint_Laurent_by_Reginald_Gray.jpg/220px-Study_of_Yves_Saint_Laurent_by_Reginald_Gray.jpg
