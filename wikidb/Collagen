187.8	Collagen	Collagen	Collagen ( ) is a group of naturally occurring proteins found in animals, especially in the flesh and connective tissues of mammals. It is the main component of connective tissue, and is the most abundant protein in mammals, making up about 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content. Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendon, ligament and skin, and is also abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral disc. The fibroblast is the most common cell which creates collagen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Tropocollagen_cross-linkage_lysyl_oxidase_%28EN%29.svg/220px-Tropocollagen_cross-linkage_lysyl_oxidase_%28EN%29.svg.png
