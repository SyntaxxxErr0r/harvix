6.23	Death_of_Dianne_Brimble	Death of Dianne Brimble	Dianne Elizabeth Brimble (10 April 1960 â€“ 24 September 2002) died aboard a P&amp;O Cruises cruise ship of a drug overdose. She is alleged to have been neglected and received callous treatment at the hands of passengers she was with at the time of taking the drug. The investigation into her death has resulted in widespread media coverage in Australia, and criticism of both party culture aboard cruise ships and of the investigation immediately following Brimble's death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/57/Diannebrimble.jpg/220px-Diannebrimble.jpg
