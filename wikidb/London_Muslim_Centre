It lies near the edge of the City of London, the capital's busy business area, and just a couple of miles from the fast-expanding London Docklands. Combined with the adjoining London Muslim Centre, it is one of the largest mosques in the United Kingdom, holding up to 5000 people.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/ELM_and_LMC_Angled_View_1.jpg/300px-ELM_and_LMC_Angled_View_1.jpg
