Since then, Sonic has become one of the world's best-known video game characters, with his series having sold more than 80 million copies. In 2005, Sonic was one of the first game character inductees into the Walk of Game, alongside Mario and Link.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Sonic_modern_and_classic_designs.png
