139.3	Hash_function	Hash function	A hash function is any algorithm or subroutine that maps large data sets of variable length, called keys, to smaller data sets of a fixed length. For example, a person's name, having a variable length, could be hashed to a single integer; and that integer can then serve as an index to an array . The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, checksums or simply hashes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg/240px-Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg.png
