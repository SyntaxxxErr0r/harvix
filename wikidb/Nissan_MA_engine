4.10	Nissan_MA_engine	Nissan MA engine	The MA is an all aluminium straight-4 SOHC 0.9 L, 1.0 L, or 1.2 L engine made by Nissan. It had an 8-valve hemispherical cylinder head. Unusually, the specified ignition timing for the MA10 running on the specified 90 RON gasoline was 2 degrees after top dead centre, reflecting a very high flame speed in the compact combustion chambers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/St-engine-bay-cropped.jpg/100px-St-engine-bay-cropped.jpg
