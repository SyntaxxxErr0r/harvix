108.5	Mutual_fund	Mutual fund	A mutual fund is a type of professionally-managed collective investment scheme that pools money from many investors. While there is no legal definition of mutual fund, the term is most commonly applied only to those collective investment schemes that are regulated, available to the general public and open-ended in nature. Hedge funds are not considered a type of mutual fund.
