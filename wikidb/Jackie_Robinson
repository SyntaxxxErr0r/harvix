148.4	Jackie_Robinson	Jackie Robinson	Jack Roosevelt "Jackie" Robinson (January 31, 1919 â€“ October 24, 1972) was an American baseball player who became the first black Major League Baseball (MLB) player of the modern era. Robinson broke the baseball color line when he debuted with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. As the first black man to play in the major leagues since the 1880s, he was instrumental in bringing an end to racial segregation in professional baseball, which had relegated black players to the Negro leagues for six decades. The example of his character and unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation, which then marked many other aspects of American life, and contributed significantly to the Civil Rights Movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Jrobinson.jpg/240px-Jrobinson.jpg
