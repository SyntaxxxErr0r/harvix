1.00	Blokhedz	Blokhedz	Blokhedz is an independent comic book/graphic novel series created by the Madtwiinz, Mark and Mike Davis. Since the release of Issue #1 in 2004, the 4-book comic series has developed a small but dedicated underground fanbase. It is characterized by a gritty style, and its "unflinching" look at the harsh realities of inner city life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Comic_image_missing.svg/125px-Comic_image_missing.svg.png
