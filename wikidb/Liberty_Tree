24.23	Liberty_Tree	Liberty Tree	The Liberty Tree (1646â€“1775) was a famous elm tree that stood in Boston near Boston Common, in the days before the American Revolution. Ten years before the American Revolution, colonists in Boston staged the first act of defiance against the British government at the tree. The tree became a rallying point for the growing resistance to the rule of Britain over the American colonies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Philip_Dawe_%28attributed%29%2C_The_Bostonians_Paying_the_Excise-man%2C_or_Tarring_and_Feathering_%281774%29_-_02.jpg
