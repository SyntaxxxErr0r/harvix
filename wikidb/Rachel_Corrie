98.9	Rachel_Corrie	Rachel Corrie	Rachel Aliene Corrie (April 10, 1979 â€“ March 16, 2003) was an American member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM). She died in disputed circumstances while acting as a human shield. An IDF investigation concluded that she died after being struck by falling debris. It also stated that as she was standing behind debris, the driver, who already had a very limited field of vision due to the protective cage he was working in, could not see her. Members of the International Solidarity Movement said that she was killed by the bulldozer and that there was nothing to obscure the driver's view. A student at The Evergreen State College, she had taken a year off to travel to the Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Rachel_corrie.jpeg/225px-Rachel_corrie.jpeg
