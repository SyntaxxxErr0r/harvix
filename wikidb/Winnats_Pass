6.02	Winnats_Pass	Winnats Pass	Winnats Pass is in the High Peak area of the English county of Derbyshire. It lies to the west of the village of Castleton, in the National Trust's High Peak Estate. The road winds through a cleft, surrounded by towering limestone pinnacles. The pass was once thought to have originated as a giant collapsed cavern; however, a more recent explanation is that it was a ravine between the coral reefs that originally formed the limestone. The name is a corruption of 'wind gates'. A local legend is that the pass is haunted after a young couple were murdered by miners.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/WinnatsPass.jpg/180px-WinnatsPass.jpg
