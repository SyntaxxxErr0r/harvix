1.00	Rag_Doll	Rag doll	A rag doll is a children's toy. It is a cloth figure, a doll traditionally home-made from (and stuffed with) spare scraps of material. They are one of the most ancient children's toys in existence; the British Museum has a Roman rag doll, found in a child's grave dating from 300 BC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Hand_made_dolls.jpg/200px-Hand_made_dolls.jpg
