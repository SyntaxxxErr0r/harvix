1.00	A_solis_ortus_cardine	A solis ortus cardine	A solis ortus cardine is a Latin poem by Coelius Sedulius (died circa 450), narrating Christ's life from His birth to His resurrection. Its 23 verses each begin with a consecutive letter of the alphabet, making the poem an Abecedarius. It is the basis for two hymns in the Roman Catholic liturgy, both later adapted by Martin Luther.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/A_solis_ortus.jpg/220px-A_solis_ortus.jpg
