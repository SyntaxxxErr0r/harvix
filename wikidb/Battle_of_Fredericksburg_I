2.00	Battle_of_Fredericksburg_I	Battle of Fredericksburg	The Battle of Fredericksburg was fought December 11â€“15, 1862, in and around Fredericksburg, Virginia, between General Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside. The Union army's futile frontal assaults on December 13 against entrenched Confederate defenders on the heights behind the city is remembered as one of the most one-sided battles of the American Civil War, with Union casualties more than twice as heavy as those suffered by the Confederates.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Battle_of_Fredericksburg%2C_Dec_13%2C_1862.png/300px-Battle_of_Fredericksburg%2C_Dec_13%2C_1862.png
