59.4	Temple	Temple	A temple (from the Latin word ) is a structure reserved for religious or spiritual activities, such as prayer and sacrifice, or analogous rites. A templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or augur. It has the same root as the word "template," a plan in preparation of the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur. Templa also became associated with the dwelling places of a god or gods. The word "temple" dates to about the 6th century BCE. Despite the specific set of meanings associated with the religion of the ancient Rome, the word has now become quite widely used to describe a house of worship for any number of religions and is even used for time periods prior to the Romans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Hephaistos.temple.AC.02.jpg/300px-Hephaistos.temple.AC.02.jpg
