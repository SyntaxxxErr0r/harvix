57.1	Barcode_reader	Barcode reader	A barcode reader (or barcode scanner) is an electronic device for reading printed barcodes. Like a flatbed scanner, it consists of a light source, a lens and a light sensor translating optical impulses into electrical ones. Additionally, nearly all barcode readers contain decoder circuitry analyzing the barcode's image data provided by the sensor and sending the barcode's content to the scanner's output port.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Barcode-scanner.jpg/220px-Barcode-scanner.jpg
