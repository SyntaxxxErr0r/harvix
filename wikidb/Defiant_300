1.00	Defiant_300	Defiant 300	The Defiant 300 is a prototype aircraft of the Philippines developed in cooperation with the PADC, Philippine Air Force and the PASF. The project was made possible through the Capt. Panfillo Villaruel, the man who designed the aircraft. The first prototype was completed in 1986 and had its maiden flight in 1987, which lasted a little more than an hour. The Defiant 300's fuselage was composite construction (wood and fiberglass) and was powered by a 300hp Lycoming piston engine. Landing gear was taken from the Beech T-34 and provided by the PAF. The intent of the program was to provide the PAF with a trainer and light strike aircraft similar in performance to the Tucano. The Defiant 300 was to have been followed by a larger version equipped with a turboprop engine and designated the "Defiant 500". The project languished soon after the development of the prototype because of lack of government support. The sole remaining prototype now lies abandoned at an empty lot in Villamor Air Base.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/Defiant_300-Construction-0001.jpg/220px-Defiant_300-Construction-0001.jpg
