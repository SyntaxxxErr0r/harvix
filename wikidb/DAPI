8.10	DAPI	DAPI	DAPI or 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole is a fluorescent stain that binds strongly to A-T rich regions in DNA. It is used extensively in fluorescence microscopy. DAPI can pass through an intact cell membrane therefore it can be used to stain both live and fixed cells, though it passes through the membrane less efficiently in live cells and therefore the effectiveness of the stain is lower.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/DAPI.svg/200px-DAPI.svg.png
