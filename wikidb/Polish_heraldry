1.30	Polish_heraldry	Polish heraldry	Polish heraldry is a branch of heraldry focused on studying the development of coats of arms in the lands of historical Poland (and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), as well as specifically-Polish traits of heraldry. The term is also used to refer to Polish heraldic system, as opposed to systems used elsewhere, notably in Western Europe. As such, it is an integral part of the history of the szlachta, the Polish nobility.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Herb_Rzeczpospolitej_Obojga_Narodow_%28Alex_K%29.svg/200px-Herb_Rzeczpospolitej_Obojga_Narodow_%28Alex_K%29.svg.png
