2.01	HLA-DQ1	HLA-DQ1	HLA-DQ1 is a serotype that covers a broad range of HLA-DQ haplotypes. Historically it was identified as a DR-like alpha chain called DC1, later, it was among 3 types DQw1 (later DQ1, and split into DQ5 and DQ6), DQw2 and DQw3. Of these three serotyping specificities only DQw1 recognized DQ alpha chain. The serotype is positive in individuals who bear the DQA1*01 alleles. The most frequently found within this group are: DQA1*0101, *0102, *0103, and *0104. In the illustration on the right, DQ1 serotyping antibodies recognizes the DQ Î± (magenta), where antibodies to DQA1* gene products bind variable regions close to the peptide binding pocket.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/DQ_Illustration.PNG/250px-DQ_Illustration.PNG
