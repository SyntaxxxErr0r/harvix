307.6	Uncertainty_principle	Uncertainty principle	In quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states a fundamental limit on the accuracy with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously known. In layman's terms, the more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be controlled, determined, or known.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Uncertainty_principle.gif/220px-Uncertainty_principle.gif
