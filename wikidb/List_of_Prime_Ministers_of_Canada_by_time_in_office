7.10	List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada_by_time_in_office	List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office	Prime ministers of Canada do not have a fixed term of office; instead, they may stay in office as long as their government is supported by parliament under a system of responsible government. Both the number of terms served and the length of individual terms have varied considerably since Confederation. Historically, elections have been held every three to five years, although since 2006 a government act set fixed election days every four years unless parliament is dissolved earlier by the Governor General. Prime ministers can be re-elected to serve any number of consecutive mandates, and some have served up to six terms, while several others have served for less than one full term. There are also four prime ministers who served multiple non-consecutive terms in the office.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/WilliamLyonMackenzieKing.jpg/220px-WilliamLyonMackenzieKing.jpg
