78.5	Intersex	Intersex	Intersex, in humans and other animals, is the presence of intermediate or atypical combinations of physical features that usually distinguish female from male. This is usually understood to be congenital, involving chromosomal, morphologic, genital and/or gonadal anomalies, such as diversion from typical XX-female or XY-male presentations, e.g., sex reversal (XY-female, XX-male), genital ambiguity, or sex developmental differences. An intersex individual may have biological characteristics of both the male and the female sexes. Intersexuality as a term was adopted by medicine during the 20th century, and applied to human beings whose biological sex cannot be classified as clearly male or female. Intersex was initially adopted by intersex activists who criticize traditional medical approaches to sex assignment and seek to be heard in the construction of new approaches.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/French_School%2C_Hermaphroditus%2C_from_a_Herculanese_fresco_%28c.1800%2C_coloured_engraving%29.jpg/180px-French_School%2C_Hermaphroditus%2C_from_a_Herculanese_fresco_%28c.1800%2C_coloured_engraving%29.jpg
