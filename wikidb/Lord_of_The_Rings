4.21	Lord_of_The_Rings	The Lord of the Rings	The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier, less complex children's fantasy novel The Hobbit (1937), but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War II. It is the third best-selling novel ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/Jrrt_lotr_cover_design.jpg/250px-Jrrt_lotr_cover_design.jpg
