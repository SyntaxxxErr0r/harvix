77.4	Priming_(psychology)	Priming (psychology)	Priming while improving performance decreases neural processing in the cerebral cortex of sensory stimuli with stimulus repetition. This has been found in single-cell recordings and in electroencephalography (EEG) upon gamma waves, with PET and functional MRI. This reduction is due to representational sharpening in the early sensory areas which reduces the number of neurons representing the stimulus. This leads to a more selective activation of neurons representing objects in higher cognitive areas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Brodmann_areas_17_18_19.png/220px-Brodmann_areas_17_18_19.png
