In Plato's Symposium, Porus, or Poros, was the personification of plenty. He was seduced by Penia (poverty) while drunk on more than his fill of nectar at Aphrodite's birthday. Penia gave birth to Eros (love) from their union. Porus was the son of Metis. This figure exists in Roman mythology as well, in which Porus is the personification of abundance. He is the brother of Athena.
