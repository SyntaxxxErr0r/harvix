73.7	Glossolalia	Glossolalia	Glossolalia or speaking in tongues is the fluid vocalizing (or less commonly, the writing of), speech-like syllables which lack any readily comprehended meaning, in some cases, as part of religious practice. The significance of glossolalia has varied in context, with some minorities considering it as a part of a sacred language. It is most prominently practiced within Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity, but it is also practiced in non-Christian religions as well. Many believe that the vocalizations are a reaction to externally induced hysteria.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/026_la_times.gif/290px-026_la_times.gif
