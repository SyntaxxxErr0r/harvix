97.4	Pasteurization	Pasteurization	Pasteurization (or pasteurisation, see spelling differences) is a process of heating a food, usually a liquid, to a specific temperature for a definite length of time and then cooling it immediately. This process slows spoilage due to microbial growth in the food.
