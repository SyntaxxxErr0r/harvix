3.00	Rocky_Dzidzornu	Rocky Dzidzornu	Rocky Dzidzornu, also known as Rocky Dijon, is an African percussionist. He is known for his playing contributions to the The Rolling Stones, among others. Critic Ned Sublette has written that the addition of his conga drumming on "Sympathy for the Devil" transformed the song from "a dirge, and a dull one at that . . . making it come alive". He continued playing with them through 1968, on tracks like "Child of the Moon", "Factory Girl" and "You Can't Always Get What You Want" and also participated in the same era on the Rock and Roll Circus event. In 1970 they used him again on "Can't You Hear Me Knockin'". During that decade he went on to record extensively with Taj Mahal. He also recorded with artists such as Nick Drake, Ginger Baker, Stevie Wonder and Billy Preston. Bill Wyman also enlisted him on his 1976 solo album Stone Alone.
