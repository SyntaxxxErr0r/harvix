4.21	Culture_of_South_Korea	Culture of South Korea	South Korea's academic environment is extremely competitive. Korean society regards getting into a prestigious university as a prerequisite to success. Most of a student's career is focused on admission to such universities, although this attitude has shifted in recent years. Nearly all of the nation's top schools (both high schools and universities) are located in Seoul, inviting criticism that rural areas face structural disadvantages. Rural students undergo hours of daily commute if admitted to a Seoul school.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Classroom_in_FTC.JPG/250px-Classroom_in_FTC.JPG
