53.9	Optical_coherence_tomography	Optical coherence tomography	Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical signal acquisition and processing method. It captures micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within optical scattering media (e.g., biological tissue). Optical coherence tomography is an interferometric technique, typically employing near-infrared light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. Confocal microscopy, another similar technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Nibib_030207_105309_sarcoma.jpg/230px-Nibib_030207_105309_sarcoma.jpg
