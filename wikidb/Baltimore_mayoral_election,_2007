2.11	Baltimore_mayoral_election,_2007	Baltimore mayoral election, 2007	The 2007 Baltimore mayoral election was held on November 6, 2007. Because Baltimore's electorate is overwhelmingly Democratic, Sheila Dixon's victory in the Democratic primary on September 11 all but assured her of victory in the general election, and she defeated Republican candidate Elbert Henderson in the general election by an overwhelming majority. Dixon, who as president of the Baltimore City Council became mayor in January 2007 when Martin O'Malley resigned to become Governor of Maryland, was the first woman to be elected to the office.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Great_Seal_of_Maryland_reverse.png/180px-Great_Seal_of_Maryland_reverse.png
