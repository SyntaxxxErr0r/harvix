97.8	Paleolithic	Paleolithic	The Paleolithic (or Palæolithic) Age, Era or Period, is a prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Modes I and II), and covers roughly 99% of human technological prehistory. It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools, probably by Hominins such as Australopithecines, 2.6 million years ago, to the end of the Pleistocene around 10,000 BP. The Paleolithic era is followed by the Mesolithic. The date of the Paleolithic—Mesolithic boundary may vary by locality as much as several thousand years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Homo_heidelbergensis-Cranium_-5.jpg/220px-Homo_heidelbergensis-Cranium_-5.jpg
