103.0	J._Robert_Oppenheimer	J. Robert Oppenheimer	Julius Robert Oppenheimernote 1 (April 22, 1904 â€“ February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. Along with Enrico Fermi, he is often called the "father of the atomic bomb" for his role in the Manhattan Project, the World War II project that developed the first nuclear weapons. The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945 in the Trinity test in New Mexico; Oppenheimer remarked later that it brought to mind words from the Bhagavad Gita: "Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."note 2	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/JROppenheimer-LosAlamos.jpg/200px-JROppenheimer-LosAlamos.jpg
