6.00	Autonomous_research_robot	Autonomous research robot	The Denning Mobile Robot Company of Boston was the first company to offer ready-made autonomous robots that were subsequently purchased primarily by researchers. Grinnell More's Real World Interface, Inc. (RWI) and James Slater's Nomadic Technologies , along with Francesco Mondada's K-Team (Switzerland), were other pioneering companies in this field, addressing the need for ready-made robots to be made available to robotics researchers. RWI created the B-21, Nomadic the XR4000, whilst the tiny Khepera mobile robot emerged from the stables of the Swiss K-Team. However, the high price of these inventions meant that only a few graduate students and military researchers could afford them. Eventually, the low-cost Pioneer robot was introduced in 1995 (from a collaboration between RWI and ActivMedia Robotics), a project that was to open the floodgates to new research in mobile robotics due the broader accessibility that the affordable price facilitated.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/ActivMedia_Pioneer_3-AT_robot.jpg/220px-ActivMedia_Pioneer_3-AT_robot.jpg
