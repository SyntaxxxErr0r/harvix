77.7	The_Master_and_Margarita	The Master and Margarita	The Master and Margarita (Russian: ) is a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov, woven around the premise of a visit by the Devil to the fervently atheistic Soviet Union. Many critics consider it to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, and the foremost of Soviet satires, directed against a suffocatingly bureaucratic social order.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/MasterAndMargerita.jpg/200px-MasterAndMargerita.jpg
