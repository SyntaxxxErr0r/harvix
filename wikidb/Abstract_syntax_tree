114.1	Abstract_syntax_tree	Abstract syntax tree	In computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST), or just syntax tree, is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The syntax is 'abstract' in the sense that it does not represent every detail that appears in the real syntax. For instance, grouping parentheses are implicit in the tree structure, and a syntactic construct such as an if-condition-then expression may be denoted by a single node with two branches.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Abstract_syntax_tree_for_Euclidean_algorithm.svg/400px-Abstract_syntax_tree_for_Euclidean_algorithm.svg.png
