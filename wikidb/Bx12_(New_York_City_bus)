1.00	Bx12_(New_York_City_bus)	207th Street Crosstown Line	The 207th Street Crosstown Line is a public transit line in New York City serving the boroughs of Manhattan and The Bronx. The line, originally a streetcar pre-dating 1910, ran from Inwood in Manhattan to Belmont in the Bronx. The line is now the Bx12 bus route, operated by the New York City Transit Authority. After buses replaced streetcars in 1948, there have been a number of changes to the route. Most notably, it is the first Bus Rapid Transit route to enter service in the City of New York, branded as Select Bus Service. Both the Bx12 local and SBS carried a combined total of 45,777 riders each weekday. The total ridership in 2009 was 14,736,515, ranking it third in ridership citywide and the busiest in the Bronx.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/MTA_New_York_City_Bus_Nova_Bus_LFSA_%282010%29.jpg/250px-MTA_New_York_City_Bus_Nova_Bus_LFSA_%282010%29.jpg
