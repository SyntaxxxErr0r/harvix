42.88	Kaiser_Wilhelm_Memorial_Church	Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church	The Protestant Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (in German: Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche, but mostly just known as Gedächtniskirche) is located in Berlin on the Kurfürstendamm in the centre of the Breitscheidplatz. The original church on the site was built in the 1890s. It was badly damaged in a bombing raid in 1943. The present building, which consists of a church with an attached foyer and a separate belfry with an attached chapel, was built between 1959 and 1963. The damaged spire of the old church has been retained and its ground floor has been made into a memorial hall.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Berlin_Eiermann_Memorial_Church.JPG/220px-Berlin_Eiermann_Memorial_Church.JPG
