1.00	Oh!_Wot_a_Dream	Oh! Wot a Dream	"Oh! Wot A Dream" was a Kevin Ayers single taken from his fourth solo album Bananamour. Ayers has stated in interviews that ‘Oh! Wot A Dream’ was about his friend and colleague Syd Barrett – “You are the most extraordinary person / You write the most peculiar kind of tunes / I met you floating as I was boating / One Afternoon”. ‘Connie On A Rubber Band’ was a non album track that would later be included on 1976 compilation Odd Ditties.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/Kevin_Ayers_-_Oh%21_Wot_A_Dream.jpg/220px-Kevin_Ayers_-_Oh%21_Wot_A_Dream.jpg
