3.20	Gerhard_Douw	Gerrit Dou	Gerrit Dou (April 7, 1613 â€“ February 9, 1675), also known as Gerard and Douw or Dow, was a Dutch Golden Age painter, whose small, highly-polished paintings are typical of the Leiden fijnschilders. He specialised in genre scenes and is noted for his trompe l'oeil "niche" paintings and candlelit night-scenes with strong chiaroscuro.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Painter_with_a_pipe_and_book_by_Gerard_Dou.jpg/170px-Painter_with_a_pipe_and_book_by_Gerard_Dou.jpg
