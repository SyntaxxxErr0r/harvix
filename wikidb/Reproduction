58.6	Reproduction	Reproduction	Reproduction (or procreation) is the biological process by which new "offspring" individual organisms are produced from their "parents". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. The known methods of reproduction are broadly grouped into two main types: sexual and asexual.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Kalanchoe_veg.jpg/350px-Kalanchoe_veg.jpg
