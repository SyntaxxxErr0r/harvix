1.01	Bank_of_the_People	Bank of the People	The Bank of the People was created from the defection of investors from Farmer's Bank in 1835. Sir Francis Hincks, head cashier at the Farmer's Bank, became cashier at the new bank. A “Provincial Loan Office” in which farmers could borrow small sums guaranteed by their land holdings became the Bank of the People in 1836. Among its stockholders were David Willson and the Children of Peace. William Lyon Mackenzie founded the Constitution newspaper on July 4, 1836 with a loan from the Bank of the People to organize the democratic reformers of Upper Canada.
