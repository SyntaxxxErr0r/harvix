102.5	Pharmaceutical_industry	Pharmaceutical industry	Drug discovery is the process by which potential drugs are discovered or designed. In the past most drugs have been discovered either by isolating the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery. Modern biotechnology often focuses on understanding the metabolic pathways related to a disease state or pathogen, and manipulating these pathways using molecular biology or biochemistry. A great deal of early-stage drug discovery has traditionally been carried out by universities and research institutions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Zoloftsoap.jpg/150px-Zoloftsoap.jpg
