55.7	Ballpoint_pen	Ballpoint pen	A ballpoint pen is a writing instrument with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber is filled with a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The sphere, usually from 0.5 mm to 1.2 mm in diameter, may be made of brass, steel, tungsten carbide, or any durable, hard (nondeformable) material.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Ballpoint-pen-parts.jpg/250px-Ballpoint-pen-parts.jpg
