257.1	Madagascar	Madagascar	Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar (older name Malagasy Republic, Malagasy: , French: ) is an island country located in the Indian Ocean off the southeastern coast of Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), as well as numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from India around 88 million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in complete isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot in which over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by human settlement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Flag_of_Madagascar.svg/125px-Flag_of_Madagascar.svg.png
