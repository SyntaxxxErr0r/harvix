58.9	Pickett's_Charge	Pickett's Charge	Pickett's Charge was an infantry assault ordered by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee against Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's Union positions on Cemetery Ridge on July 3, 1863, the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. Its futility was predicted by the charge's commander, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, and it was arguably an avoidable mistake from which the Southern war effort never fully recovered psychologically. The farthest point reached by the attack has been referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Edwin_Forbes_Pickett%27s_Charge.jpg/350px-Edwin_Forbes_Pickett%27s_Charge.jpg
