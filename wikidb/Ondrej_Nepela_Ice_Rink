It is primarily used for ice hockey and it is the home arena of HC Slovan Bratislava. It opened in 1940 and held 8,350 people until its full reconstruction started in 2009. The reconstructed arena is due to open in spring 2011. It will have increased capacity of 10,000 spectators. In the past Samsung arena was called ST Arena and T-Com Arena. So-called "reconstruction" under command of SZLH president's company costs 96 million â‚¬. Beside the reconstruction SZLH president built a new hotel next to arena, which was built without building permit in the beginning. In this hotel will be accommodated Slovak and Czech ice-hockey players and team staff at the IHWC 2011.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/OndrejNepela1.JPG/250px-OndrejNepela1.JPG
