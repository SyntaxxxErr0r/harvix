80.8	Mind_mapping	Mind map	A mind map is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks, or other items linked to and arranged around a central key word or idea. Especially in British English, the terms "spidergram" and "spidergraph" are more common, but they can cause confusion with the term "spider diagram" used in mathematics and logic. Mind maps are used to generate, visualize, structure, and classify ideas, and as an aid to studying and organizing information, solving problems, making decisions, and writing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Guru_Mindmap.jpg/300px-Guru_Mindmap.jpg
