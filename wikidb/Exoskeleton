53.9	Exoskeleton	Exoskeleton	An exoskeleton is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton of, for example, a human. In popular usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as "shells". Examples of exoskeleton animals include insects such as grasshoppers and cockroaches, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. The shells of the various groups of shelled mollusks, including those of snails, clams, tusk shells, chitons and nautilus, are also exoskeletons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Dragonfly-nymph-exoskeleton.jpg/220px-Dragonfly-nymph-exoskeleton.jpg
