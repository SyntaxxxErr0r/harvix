(ICHC for short) is the name of a weblog featuring lolcats, which are pictures of cats or other animals with captions, paired for humor value. It was created in 2007 by Eric Nakagawa (Cheezburger), a blogger from Hawaii and his girlfriend, Kari Unebasami (Tofuburger). The website is one of the most popular internet sites displaying lolcats, receiving as many as 1,500,000 hits per day. ICHC was instrumental in bringing animal-based image macros and lolspeak into mainstream usage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Ichc_logo.png
