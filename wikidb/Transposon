63.43	Transposon	Transposable element	A transposable element is a DNA sequence that can change its relative position (self-transpose) within the genome of a single cell. The mechanism of transposition can be either "copy and paste" or "cut and paste". Transposition can create phenotypically significant mutations and alter the cell's genome size. Barbara McClintock's discovery of these jumping genes early in her career earned her a Nobel prize in 1983.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Composite_transposon.svg/400px-Composite_transposon.svg.png
