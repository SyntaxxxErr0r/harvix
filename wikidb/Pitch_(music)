98.0	Pitch_(music)	Pitch (music)	Pitch is an auditory perceptual property that allows the ordering of sounds on a frequency-related scale. Pitches are compared as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies, which require "sound whose frequency is clear and stable enough to be heard as not noise". Pitch is a major auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c5/Bach_-_Taylor_1873.png/250px-Bach_-_Taylor_1873.png
