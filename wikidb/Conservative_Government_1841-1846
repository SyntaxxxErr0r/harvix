1.00	Conservative_Government_1841-1846	Tory Government 1841â€“1846	Sir Robert Peel's second government came to power in 1841 after the Conservative victory in the General Election caused the Whig government of Lord Melbourne to resign. Henry Goulburn was Chancellor of the Exchequer, the future Prime Minister Lord Aberdeen Foreign Secretary and Sir James Graham Home Secretary. William Ewart Gladstone, who was yet to join the Liberal Party, became a member of the cabinet for the first time in 1843 when he was appointed President of the Board of Trade. His future rival Benjamin Disraeli was overlooked by Peel and was a sharp critic of the government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Robert_Peel.jpg/200px-Robert_Peel.jpg
