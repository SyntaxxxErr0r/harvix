12.77	Exalted	Exalted	Exalted is a role-playing game published by White Wolf Publishing. The game is classified as high fantasy, but may be more accurately described as "mythic fantasy", as the developer specifically avoided drawing on J. R. R. Tolkien, but rather turned to a mixture of world mythologies, as well as manga for inspiration. The game is currently in its second edition, and with revised and expanded second edition supplementary materials being released. First Edition is no longer in development, but was originally created by Robert Hatch, Justin Achilli and Stephan Wieck. The original core rulebook was published in July 2001.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/Exalted_Second_Edition_Core_Book.jpg/220px-Exalted_Second_Edition_Core_Book.jpg
