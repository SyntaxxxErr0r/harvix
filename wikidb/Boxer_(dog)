51.8	Boxer_(dog)	Boxer (dog)	Developed in Germany, the Boxer is a breed of stocky, medium-sized, short-haired dog. The coat is smooth and fawn or brindled, with or without white markings. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), and have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser and is part of the Molosser group.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Rj_boxer.jpg/220px-Rj_boxer.jpg
