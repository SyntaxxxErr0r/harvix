66.1	2010_Copiap%C3%B3_mining_accident	2010 Copiapó mining accident	The 2010 Copiapó mining accident, also known as the "Chilean mining accident", began in the afternoon of Thursday, 5 August 2010 as a significant cave-in at the troubled 121-year-old San José copper–gold mine. The mine is located deep in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest and harshest regions on earth, about 45 kilometers (28 mi) north of Copiapó, in northern Chile, South America. The buried men, who became known as "Los 33" ("The 33"), were trapped 700 meters (2,300 ft) underground and about 5 kilometers (3 mi) from the mine's entrance via spiraling underground service ramps. The mixed crew of experienced miners and technical support personnel subsequently survived for a record 69 days deep underground before their rescue. Previous geological instability at the old mine and a long record of fines and safety violations for the mine's owners had resulted in a series of accidents, including eight deaths, during the dozen years leading up to this accident. As a result of the mine's notorious history, it was originally thought that the workers had probably not survived the collapse or would starve to death before they were found, if ever.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Mina_San_Jos%C3%A9_de_Copiap%C3%B3_en_2010.jpg/240px-Mina_San_Jos%C3%A9_de_Copiap%C3%B3_en_2010.jpg
