1.00	Semifinal	Single-elimination tournament	A single-elimination tournament, also called a knockout, cup or sudden death tournament, is a type of elimination tournament where the loser of each match or bracket is immediately eliminated from winning the championship or first prize in the event. This does not always mean that the defeated competitor will not participate further in the tournament: in some such tournaments, consolation or "classification" contests are subsequently held among those already defeated to determine the awarding of lesser places, for example, a third place playoff.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Mitbat-2007-bracket-large.png/250px-Mitbat-2007-bracket-large.png
