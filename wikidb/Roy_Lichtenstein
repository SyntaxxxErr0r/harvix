128.6	Roy_Lichtenstein	Roy Lichtenstein	Roy Lichtenstein (October 27, 1923 â€“ September 29, 1997) was a prominent American pop artist. During the 1960s his paintings were exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City and along with Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and others he became a leading figure in the new art movement. His work defined the basic premise of pop art better than any other through parody. Favoring the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Lichtenstein produced hard-edged, precise compositions that documented while it parodied often in a tongue-in-cheek humorous manner. His work was heavily influenced by both popular advertising and the comic book style. He described Pop Art as, "not 'American' painting but actually industrial painting".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Roy_Lichtenstein.jpg/250px-Roy_Lichtenstein.jpg
