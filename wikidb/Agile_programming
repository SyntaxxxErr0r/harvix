15.21	Agile_programming	Agile software development	Agile software development is a group of software development methods based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It is a conceptual framework that promotes foreseen interactions throughout the development cycle. The Agile Manifesto introduced the term in 2001.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Agile_Software_Development_methodology.jpg/320px-Agile_Software_Development_methodology.jpg
