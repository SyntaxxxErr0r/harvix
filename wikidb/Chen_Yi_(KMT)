3.00	Chen_Yi_(KMT)	Chen Yi (Kuomintang)	Chen Yi (traditional Chinese: ; simplified Chinese: ; pinyin: Chén Yí; courtesy names Gongxia (公俠) and later Gongqia (公洽), sobriquet Tuisu (退素); 1883 – June 18, 1950) was the Chief Executive and Garrison Commander (警備總司令) of Taiwan after it was surrendered by Japan to the Republic of China, which acted on behalf of the Allied Powers, in 1945. His infamous mishandling of the tension between Taiwanese locals and Mainlanders precipitated the February 28 Incident, and he was later dismissed and executed for disloyalty (though for reasons unrelated to his tenure in Taiwan).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Chen_Yi.jpg/150px-Chen_Yi.jpg
