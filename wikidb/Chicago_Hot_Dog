7.12	Chicago_Hot_Dog	Chicago-style hot dog	A Chicago-style hot dog, or Chicago Dog, is a steamed or water-simmered all-beef frankfurter on a poppy seed bun, originating from the city of Chicago, Illinois. The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard; chopped white onions; sweet pickle relish with a large amount of fresh chopped mint leaves mixed in, giving it a bright green color (some fast food chains just use green food dye, however, the mint is essential to get the correct "Chicago Dog" flavor); a dill pickle spear; tomato slices or wedges; pickled sport peppers; and a dash of celery salt. The complete assembly of a Chicago hot dog is said to be "dragged through the garden" due to the many toppings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Chicago-style_hot_dog.jpg/300px-Chicago-style_hot_dog.jpg
