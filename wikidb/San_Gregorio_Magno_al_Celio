3.00	San_Gregorio_Magno_al_Celio	San Gregorio Magno al Celio	San Gregorio Magno al Celio, also known as San Gregorio al Celio or simply San Gregorio, is a church in Rome, Italy, which is part of a monastery of monks of the Camaldolese branch of the Benedictine Order. St. Augustine of Canterbury and his Benedictines were sent by Pope Saint Gregory the Great, the basilica's namesake and patron saint, to evangelize England in 597 AD. The 1,100th anniversary of the founding of their order was celebrated here at an evening Lenten Vespers service on Saturday, March 10, 2012. It was attended by Anglican and Catholic prelates, and was jointly led by the Holy Father, His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI, and His Grace, the Most Reverend Archbishop Dr. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury. It is located on the Caelian Hill, in front of the Palatine. Next to the basilica and monastery is a convent of nuns and a homeless shelter run by the order Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta founded, the Missionaries of Charity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Celio_-_san_Gregorio_-_1733.JPG/275px-Celio_-_san_Gregorio_-_1733.JPG
