120.3	The_Prince	The Prince	The Prince (Italian: Il Principe) is a political treatise by the Italian diplomat, historian and political theorist Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, De Principatibus . But the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but "long before then, in fact since the first appearance of the Prince in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Machiavelli_Principe_Cover_Page.jpg
