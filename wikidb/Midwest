53.0	Midwest	Midwestern United States	The Midwestern United States as defined by the United States Census Bureau, is one of the four U.S. geographic regions. Though it is geographically in the north, and more eastern than western, the term refers to the fact that the region is midway to the opposite coast when heading directly west from New England and New York, where the term originated. The area is now called the Midwest throughout the English-speaking world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Map_of_USA_Midwest.svg/300px-Map_of_USA_Midwest.svg.png
