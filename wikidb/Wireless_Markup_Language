73.1	Wireless_Markup_Language	Wireless Markup Language	Wireless Markup Language (WML), based on XML, is a markup language intended for devices that implement the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) specification, such as mobile phones. It provides navigational support, data input, hyperlinks, text and image presentation, and forms, much like HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It preceded the use of other markup languages now used with WAP, such as HTML itself, and XHTML (which are gaining in popularity as processing power in mobile devices increases).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Mobile_Web_Standards_Evolution_Vector.svg/300px-Mobile_Web_Standards_Evolution_Vector.svg.png
