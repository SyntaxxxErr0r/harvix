123.6	Taiko	Taiko	Taiko ) means "drum" in Japanese (etymologically "great" or "wide drum"). Outside Japan, the word is often used to refer to any of the various Japanese drums (和太鼓, "wa-daiko", "Japanese drum", in Japanese) and to the relatively recent art-form of ensemble taiko drumming (sometimes called more specifically, "kumi-daiko" (組太鼓)). The performances can last between 5 and 25 minutes and typically follow a jo-ha-kyū (beginning, middle, end/rapid, sudden, urgent, and emergency) structure, which means the performance will speed up significantly towards the grand finale.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/TaikoDrummersAichiJapan.jpg/250px-TaikoDrummersAichiJapan.jpg
