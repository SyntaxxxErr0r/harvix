2.00	Norse_rituals	Norse rituals	Norse pagan worship is the traditional religious rituals practiced by Norse pagans in Scandinavia in pre-Christian times. Norse paganism was a folk religion (as opposed to organised religion) that had the survival and regeneration of society as its main purpose. Thus the cult was decentralized and tied to the village and the family, although evidence of great national religious festivals exists. The leaders - for instance the chiefs - managed the cult on behalf of society. On each farm it was the head of the family and nation-wide it was the king. Pre-Christian Scandinavians thus had no word for religion in a modern sense. The closest counterpart is the word sidr, meaning custom. This meant that during the conversion period, Christianity was called n√Ωr sidr (the new custom) while paganism was called forn sidr (ancient custom). The centre of gravity of pre-Christian religion lay in religious practice, that is sacred acts, rituals and worship of the gods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Detail_from_G_181.jpg/300px-Detail_from_G_181.jpg
