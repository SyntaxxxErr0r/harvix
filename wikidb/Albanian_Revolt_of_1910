1.00	Albanian_Revolt_of_1910	Albanian Revolt of 1910	The Albanian Revolt of 1910 was a reaction to the new centralization policies of the Young Turk Ottoman government in Albania. It was the first of a series of major uprisings which led to the Albanian Declaration of Independence in 1912. New taxes levied in the early months of 1910 led to Isa Boletini's activity to convince Albanian leaders who had already been involved in a 1909 uprising to try another revolt against the Ottoman Empire. The Albanian attacks on the Ottomans in Prishtinë and Ferizaj, the killing of the Ottoman commander in Peć, and the insurgents' blocking of the railway to Skopje at the Kaçanik Pass led to the Ottoman government's declaration of martial law in the area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Isa_boletini_vlora_1912.jpg/270px-Isa_boletini_vlora_1912.jpg
