185.2	Fourth_Estate	Fourth Estate	The Fourth Estate (or fourth estate) is a societal or political force or institution whose influence is not consistently or officially recognized. "Fourth Estate" most commonly refers to the news media; especially print journalism or "The Press". Thomas Carlyle attributed the origin of the term to Edmund Burke, who used it in a parliamentary debate in 1787 on the opening up of Press reporting of the House of Commons of Great Britain. Earlier writers have applied the term to lawyers, to the British queens consort (acting as a free agent, independent of the king), and to the proletariat. The term makes implicit reference to the earlier division of the three Estates of the Realm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Il_quarto_stato_%28Volpedo%29.jpg/220px-Il_quarto_stato_%28Volpedo%29.jpg
