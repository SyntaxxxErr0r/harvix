93.4	Sea	Sea	A sea generally refers to a large body of salt water, but the term is used in other contexts as well. Most commonly, it means a large expanse of saline water connected with an ocean, and is commonly used as a synonym for ocean. It is also used sometimes to describe a large saline lake that lacks a natural outlet, such as the Caspian Sea.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Waves_lajolla.jpg/300px-Waves_lajolla.jpg
