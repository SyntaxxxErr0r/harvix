Images of women representing mother earth, and mother nature, are timeless. In prehistoric times, goddesses were worshipped for their association with fertility, fecundity, and agricultural bounty. Priestesses held dominion over aspects of Incan, Algonquian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Slavonic, Germanic, Roman, Greek, Indian, and Iroquoian religions in the millennia prior to the inception of patriarchal religions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Aion_mosaic_Glyptothek_Munich_W504.jpg/190px-Aion_mosaic_Glyptothek_Munich_W504.jpg
