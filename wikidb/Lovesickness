2.01	Lovesickness	Lovesickness	Lovesickness describes the informal syndrome of rejected or unrequited love and covers physical as well as mental symptoms. It is not to be confused with the condition of being lovestruck. Almost all humans suffer from love sickness one or more times in their lives. Although typically harmless it can lead for some personalities to serious physical or mental illness, suicide or possibly even death. In psychology, love sickness is seldom acknowledged.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Der-Liebeskranke-Antiochus-1.jpg/220px-Der-Liebeskranke-Antiochus-1.jpg
