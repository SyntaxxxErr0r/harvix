72.5	Sandro_Botticelli	Sandro Botticelli	Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, better known as Sandro Botticelli (c. 1445 â€“ May 17, 1510) was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. He belonged to the Florentine school under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement that Giorgio Vasari would characterize less than a hundred years later as a "golden age", a thought, suitably enough, he expressed at the head of his Vita of Botticelli. Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting. Among his best known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Sandro_Botticelli_083.jpg/220px-Sandro_Botticelli_083.jpg
