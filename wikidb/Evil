78.6	Evil	Evil	Evil is the violation of, or intent to violate, some moral code. Evil is usually seen as the dualistic opposite of The Good. Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its root motives and causes; however, evil is commonly associated with conscious and deliberate wrongdoing, discrimination designed to harm others, humiliation of people designed to diminish their psychological well-being and dignity, destructiveness, motives of causing "unnecessary" pain or suffering and acts of unnecessary or indiscriminate violence. The philosophical question of whether morality is absolute or relative leads to questions about the nature of evil, with views falling into one of four opposed camps: moral absolutism, amoralism, moral relativism, and moral universalism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Ary_Scheffer_-_The_Temptation_of_Christ_%281854%29.jpg/220px-Ary_Scheffer_-_The_Temptation_of_Christ_%281854%29.jpg
