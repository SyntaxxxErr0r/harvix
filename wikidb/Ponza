12.42	Ponza	Ponza	The island was inhabited from neolithic through Roman times. According to local legends, Ponza was named after Pontius Pilate, Roman governor of Judea who tried Jesus of Nazareth for heresy. Pontius Pilate's family owned a grotto on Ponza, which is still named after him. The Pontius Pilate legend of Ponza's name has recently come into dispute amongst historians, because the name "Pontia" appears in Strabo's Geography. This pre-dates the birth of Pilate. It is not known if this is the same name as Ponza or a similar name. "Pontia" means "Land of Bridges" in Latin and Ponza has many natural arches and natural bridges, so that may be the origin of the name Pontia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Pontine_Islands_map.png/300px-Pontine_Islands_map.png
