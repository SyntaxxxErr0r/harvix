66.9	Prophet	Prophet	In religion, a prophet, from the Greek word προφήτης (profétés) meaning "advocate", is an individual who is claimed to have been contacted by the supernatural or the divine, and to speak for them, serving as an intermediary with humanity, delivering this newfound knowledge from the supernatural entity to other people. The message that the prophet conveys is called a prophecy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Isaiah%27s_Lips_Anointed_with_Fire.jpg
