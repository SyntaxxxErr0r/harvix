12.81	Gene_Ray	Time Cube	Time Cube is a website created by Gene Ray, also known as Otis E. Ray, in 1997 where he sets out his personal model of reality, which he calls Time Cube. He suggests that all of modern physics is wrong, in addition to claiming religion to be evil, specifically Christianity, and that the idea of family is poisoning children. The model proposes that each day is really four separate days occurring simultaneously. John C. Dvorak wrote in PC Magazine that "Metasites that track crackpot sites often say this is the number one nutty site."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/Timegrab.png/300px-Timegrab.png
