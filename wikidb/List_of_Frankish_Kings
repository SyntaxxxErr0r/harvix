2.73	List_of_Frankish_Kings	List of Frankish kings	The Franks were originally led by dukes (military leaders) and reguli (petty kings). The Salian Merovingians rose to dominance among the Franks and conquered most of Roman Gaul. They also conquered the Visigoths in 507. The sons of Clovis conquered the Burgundians and Alamanni. They acquired the Provence and made the Bavarii and Thuringii their clients. The Merovingians were later replaced by a new dynasty called the Carolingians in the 8th century. By the end of the 9th century, the Carolingians themselves were replaced throughout much of their realm by other dynasties. The idea of a "King of the Franks" or Rex Francorum gradually disappeared over the 12th and 13th centuries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Gr%C3%A9goire_de_Tours_Historia_Francorum_Fol._79v_initiale_orn%C3%A9e_A.jpg/195px-Gr%C3%A9goire_de_Tours_Historia_Francorum_Fol._79v_initiale_orn%C3%A9e_A.jpg
