2.00	Secondary_cell_wall	Secondary cell wall	The secondary cell wall has different ratios of wall constituents compared to the primary wall. An example of this is that wood secondary walls contain xylans, whereas the primary wall contains xyloglucans and the cellulose fraction is higher in the secondary wall. Pectins may also be absent from the secondary wall and apparently it contain no Structural proteins or enzymes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Plant_cell_showing_primary_and_secondary_wall_by_CarolineDahl.jpg/220px-Plant_cell_showing_primary_and_secondary_wall_by_CarolineDahl.jpg
