24.02	Tractor_pulling	Tractor pulling	Truck and Tractor pulling, also known as power pulling, is a motorsport competition, popular in America, Europe (especially in the Netherlands), Australia and Brazil, which requires modified tractors to pull a heavy sledge (sled) along a 35 ft wide and length of 100 meter or 300 ft+ track, with the winner being the tractor that pulls the sledge farthest. The sport is known as the world's most powerful motorsport, due to the multi-engined modified tractor pullers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/86/Tractor_pull_02.JPG/220px-Tractor_pull_02.JPG
