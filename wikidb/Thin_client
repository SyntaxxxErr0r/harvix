102.6	Thin_client	Thin client	A thin client (sometimes also called a lean or slim client) is a computer or a computer program which depends heavily on some other computer (its server) to fulfill its traditional computational roles. This stands in contrast to the traditional fat client, a computer designed to take on these roles by itself. The exact roles assumed by the server may vary, from providing data persistence (for example, for diskless nodes) to actual information processing on the client's behalf.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/PCExpanion.jpg/250px-PCExpanion.jpg
