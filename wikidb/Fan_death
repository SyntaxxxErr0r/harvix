57.2	Fan_death	Fan death	Fan death is a widely held belief in South Korea that an electric fan left running overnight in a closed room can cause the death of those inside. Fans sold in Korea are equipped with a timer switch that turns them off after a set number of minutes, which users are frequently urged to set when going to sleep with a fan on.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Korean_fans.jpg/220px-Korean_fans.jpg
