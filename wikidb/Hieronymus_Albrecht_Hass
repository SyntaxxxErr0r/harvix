The 16-foot bridge is seen closest to the bentside, on a separate, slightly raised section of soundboard. To its left are (in succession) the 8-foot hitchpin rail (resting on an internal bentside, not visible), the 8-foot bridge, and the 4-foot bridge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Hieronymus_Albrecht_Hass%2C_Hamburg%2C_1734_-_clavecin_-_IMG_3894.JPG/600px-Hieronymus_Albrecht_Hass%2C_Hamburg%2C_1734_-_clavecin_-_IMG_3894.JPG
