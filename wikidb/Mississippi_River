189.1	Mississippi_River	Mississippi River	The Mississippi River is the largest river system in North America. Flowing entirely in the United States, it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for 2,530 miles (4,070 km) to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains and even reaches into southern Canada. The Mississippi ranks fourth longest and tenth largest among the world's rivers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/FEMA_-_36449_-_Aerial_of_flooding_in_Missouri.jpg/280px-FEMA_-_36449_-_Aerial_of_flooding_in_Missouri.jpg
