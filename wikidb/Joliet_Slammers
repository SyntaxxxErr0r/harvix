They play their home games at Silver Cross Field in Joliet. They replaced the Joliet JackHammers of the Northern League after the franchise was crippled by numerous financial issues. The Jackhammers franchise was put up for sale and Steel City Baseball LLC bought out all assests, including the front office, ticketing system, and the lease of the ballpark.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/JolietSlammers.PNG/100px-JolietSlammers.PNG
