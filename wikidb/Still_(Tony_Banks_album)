2.00	Still_(Tony_Banks_album)	Still (Tony Banks album)	Still is the fourth studio album (and sixth album overall) released by Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks in 1991 on Virgin Records in the UK and Giant Records in the US. The album was originally going to be named after the track "Still It Takes Me By Surprise", but was later shorted to Still. Despite a fairly heavy promotional effort by Giant Records, the album still failed to sell well. However, many fans consider it to be his best solo album.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2e/TonyBanksStill.jpg/220px-TonyBanksStill.jpg
