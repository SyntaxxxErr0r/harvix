67.1	Rolling_shutter	Rolling shutter	Rolling shutter (also known as line scan) is a method of image acquisition in which each frame is recorded not from a snapshot of a single point in time, but rather by scanning across the frame either vertically or horizontally. In other words, not all parts of the image are recorded at exactly the same time, even though the whole frame is displayed at the same time during playback. This is in contrast with global shutter in which the entire frame is exposed for the same time window. This produces predictable distortions of fast-moving objects or when the sensor captures rapid flashes of light.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/CMOS_rolling_shutter_distortion.jpg/220px-CMOS_rolling_shutter_distortion.jpg
