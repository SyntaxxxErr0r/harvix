93.9	Bullying	Bullying	Bullying is a form of aggressive behavior manifested by the use of force or coercion to affect others, particularly when the behavior is habitual and involves an imbalance of power. It can include verbal harassment, physical assault or coercion and may be directed repeatedly towards particular victims, perhaps on grounds of race, religion, gender, sexuality, or ability. The "imbalance of power" may be social power and/or physical power. The victim of bullying is sometimes referred to as a "target".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Bullying_Irfe.jpg/220px-Bullying_Irfe.jpg
