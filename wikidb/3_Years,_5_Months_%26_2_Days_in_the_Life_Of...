13.32	3_Years,_5_Months_%26_2_Days_in_the_Life_Of...	3 Years, 5 Months &amp; 2 Days in the Life Of...	3 Years, 5 Months &amp; 2 Days in the Life Of... is the debut album by American hip hop group Arrested Development, released in 1992 (see 1992 in music). The album's chart success was the beginning of the popularization of Southern hip hop. 3 Years, 5 Months &amp; 2 Days in the Life Of... stood in stark contrast to the gangsta rap that ruled the hip hop charts in 1992 (such as Dr. Dre's The Chronic), in its focus on spirituality, peace and love. It was voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. The album's title refers to the length of time it took Arrested Development to get a record contract.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3e/ArrestedDevelopment3Years%2C5Months%262DaysintheLifeOf....jpg
