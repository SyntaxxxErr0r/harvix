60.5	Distributed_generation	Distributed generation	A microgrid is a localized grouping of electricity generation, energy storage, and loads that normally operates connected to a traditional centralized grid . This single point of common coupling with the macrogrid can be disconnected. The microgrid can then function autonomously. Generation and loads in a microgrid are usually interconnected at low voltage. From the point of view of the grid operator, a connected microgrid can be controlled as if it was one entity. Microgrid generation resources can include fuel cells, wind, solar, or other energy sources. The multiple dispersed generation sources and ability to isolate the microgrid from a larger network would provide highly reliable electric power. Byproduct heat from generation sources such as microturbines could be used for local process heating or space heating, allowing flexible trade off between the needs for heat and electric power.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Windgen59.JPG/260px-Windgen59.JPG
