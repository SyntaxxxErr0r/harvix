4.01	Ad-lib	Ad libitum	Ad libitum is Latin for "at one's pleasure"; it is often shortened to "ad lib" (as an adjective or adverb) or "ad-lib" (as a verb or noun). The roughly synonymous phrase a bene placito ("at good pleasure") is less common but, in its Italian form a piacere, entered the musical lingua franca (see below).
