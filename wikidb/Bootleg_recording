55.9	Bootleg_recording	Bootleg recording	A bootleg recording is an audio or video recording of a performance that was not officially released by the artist or under other legal authority. The process of making and distributing such recordings is known as bootlegging. A great many such recordings are simply copied and traded among fans of the artist without financial exchange, but some bootleggers are able to sell these rarities for profit, sometimes by adding professional-quality sound engineering and packaging to the raw material.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Tdkc60cassette.jpg/220px-Tdkc60cassette.jpg
