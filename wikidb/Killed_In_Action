1.10	Killed_In_Action	Killed in action	Many societies venerate those killed in action. They set aside days of remembrance for their militaries and combat dead, and they build memorials and cenotaphs in honor of their fallen. The families of those who die in combat, especially their next-of-kin, sometimes receive preferential treatment, such as military honors, exemption from taxes, and financial awards. National militaries also distinguish those killed in action with ceremonies and awards. They also build walls and memorials to honor those who died. Other awards are posthumously given, such as Purple Hearts, promotions, and other such medals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Omaha-beach-cemetery.jpg/220px-Omaha-beach-cemetery.jpg
