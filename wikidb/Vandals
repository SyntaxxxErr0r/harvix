55.8	Vandals	Vandals	The Vandals were an East Germanic tribe that entered the late Roman Empire during the 5th century. The Vandals under king Genseric entered Africa in 429 and by 439 established a kingdom which included the Roman Africa province, besides the islands of Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearics. In 455, they sacked the city of Rome. Their kingdom collapsed in the Vandalic War of 533â€“4, in which Justinian I managed to reconquer the Africa province for the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Heinrich_Leutemann%2C_Pl%C3%BCnderung_Roms_durch_die_Vandalen_%28c._1860%E2%80%931880%29.jpg/275px-Heinrich_Leutemann%2C_Pl%C3%BCnderung_Roms_durch_die_Vandalen_%28c._1860%E2%80%931880%29.jpg
