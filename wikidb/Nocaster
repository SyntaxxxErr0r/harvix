3.00	Nocaster	Nocaster	The so-called Nocaster was a short-lived variant of what is now known as the Fender Telecaster, the original solid-body electric guitar created by Leo Fender. The Nocaster, produced in early to mid-1951, was the result of legal action from the Gretsch company over the guitar's previous name, the Broadcaster (Gretsch already had the "Broadkaster" name registered for a line of drums). In the interim, before Fender had come up with an alternate name and printed appropriately revised headstock decals, factory workers simply snipped the "Broadcaster" name from its existing stock of decals, so guitars with these decals are identified simply as "Fender", without any model name. By the summer of 1951 the guitar was officially renamed as the Telecaster and has been known as such ever since.
