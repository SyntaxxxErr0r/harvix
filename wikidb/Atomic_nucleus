56.6	Atomic_nucleus	Atomic nucleus	The nucleus is the very dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom. It was discovered in 1911, as a result of Ernest Rutherford's interpretation of the famous 1909 Rutherford experiment performed by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the direction of Rutherford. The protonâ€“neutron model of nucleus was proposed by Dmitry Ivanenko in 1932. Almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus, with a very small contribution from the orbiting electrons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Helium_atom_QM.svg/300px-Helium_atom_QM.svg.png
