85.6	Slashdot	Slashdot	Slashdot (sometimes abbreviated as /.) is a technology-related news website owned by Geeknet, Inc. The site, which bills itself as "News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters", features user-submitted and â€‘evaluated current affairs news stories about science- and technology-related topics. Each story has a comments section attached to it. Slashdot was founded in 1997 as a blog, Chips &amp; Dips, by Hope College computer science student Rob Malda, also known as "Commander Taco" and fellow classmate Jeff Bates, also known as "Hemos". The name "Slashdot" is described by Malda as "a sort of obnoxious parody of a URL", chosen to confuse those who tried to pronounce the URL of the site ("h-t-t-p-colon-slash-slash-slashdot-dot-org").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/Slashdot_screen_capture.png/256px-Slashdot_screen_capture.png
