59.9	Backlight	Backlight	A backlight is a form of illumination used in liquid crystal displays (LCDs). As LCDs do not produce light themselves (unlike for example Cathode ray tube (CRT) displays), they need illumination (ambient light or a special light source) to produce a visible image. Backlights illuminate the LCD from the side or back of the display panel, unlike frontlights, which are placed in front of the LCD. Backlights are used in small displays to increase readability in low light conditions, and in computer displays and LCD televisions to produce light in a manner similar to a CRT display.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/EL_unlit-lit_animation.gif/220px-EL_unlit-lit_animation.gif
