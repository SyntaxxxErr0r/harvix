1.10	Filthy_Thievin'_Bastards	Filthy Thieving Bastards	The Filthy Thieving Bastards is an American folk/punk rock group formed in 2000 in San Francisco, California. The band was originally a side project put together by Johnny Bonnel and Darius Koski of the Swingin' Utters. Spike Slawson (also from Swingin' Utters) later joined the band, along with recording engineer Randy Burk. Greg Lisher from Camper Van Beethoven guested on guitar for several songs on their second release. Their music is influenced by folk rock, Celtic rock, country music, 60's pop, and punk rock, with an acknowledged and oft-noted debt to the music of The Pogues.
