1.10	Kerr_lake	Kerr Lake	Kerr Lake (officially John H. Kerr Reservoir, also known as Bugg's Island Lake) is a reservoir along the border of the U.S. states of North Carolina and Virginia created by the John H. Kerr Dam. The dam construction started in 1947 and took 2,100+ workers in three shifts, 24 hours a day/ 7 days a week, 365 days a year, more than four years to complete, and was finished in 1952 to produce electricity and to provide flood control. It is the largest reservoir in Virginia. It is owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. It is located in parts of Vance, Granville, and Warren counties in North Carolina, and Mecklenburg, Charlotte, and Halifax counties in Virginia. At its maximum capacity, it's one of the largest reservoirs in the Southeastern United States. The lake has over 850 miles of shoreline and covers approximately 50,000 acres (200 kmÂ²). The lake is named for Congressman John H. Kerr of North Carolina, who supported the original creation of the lake.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/USACE_John_H_Kerr_Dam_and_Lake.jpg/240px-USACE_John_H_Kerr_Dam_and_Lake.jpg
