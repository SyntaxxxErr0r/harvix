2.10	Honda_GL500	Honda CX series	The Honda CX series motorcycles, including the GL500 and GL650 variants, were developed and released by Honda in the late 1970s, with production ending in most markets by the mid 1980s. The design included innovative features and technologies that were uncommon or unused at the time such as liquid cooling, electric-only starting, low-maintenance shaft drive, modular wheels, and dual CV-type carburetors that were tuned for reduced emissions. The electronic ignition system was separated from the rest of the electrical system, enabling the motorcycle to be push-started and ridden in case of a total electrical system failure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Honda_cx500_1981_blue_rhs.jpg/300px-Honda_cx500_1981_blue_rhs.jpg
