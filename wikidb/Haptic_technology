77.4	Haptic_technology	Haptic technology	Haptic technology, or haptics, is a tactile feedback technology which takes advantage of the sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. This mechanical stimulation can be used to assist in the creation of virtual objects in a computer simulation, to control such virtual objects, and to enhance the remote control of machines and devices . It has been described as "doing for the sense of touch what computer graphics does for vision". Haptic devices may incorporate tactile sensors that measure forces exerted by the user on the interface.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Dreamcast-Jump-Pack.jpg/300px-Dreamcast-Jump-Pack.jpg
