112.5	Amiga_500	Amiga 500	The Amiga 500 - also known as the A500 (or its code name 'Rock Lobster') - was the first “low-end” Commodore Amiga 16/32-bit multimedia home/personal computer. It was announced at the winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1987 - at the same time as the high-end Amiga 2000 - and competed directly against the Atari 520ST. Before Amiga 500 was shipped, Commodore suggested that the list price of the Amiga 500 was 595.95 USD without a monitor. At delivery in 1987, Commodore announced that the Amiga 500 would carry a 699 USD list price.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Amiga500_system.jpg/280px-Amiga500_system.jpg
