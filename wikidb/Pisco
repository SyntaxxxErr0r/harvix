55.4	Pisco	Pisco	Pisco is a colorless or yellowish-to-amber colored grape brandy produced in winemaking regions of Peru and Chile. Pisco was developed by Spanish settlers in the 16th century as an alternative to orujo, a pomace brandy that was being imported from Spain. There are many theories about the origin of the name pisco some saying that it takes name from town of Pisco, located on the coast of Peru. The first vineyards were planted in the coastal valleys in the Viceroyalty of Peru, when vine plants arrived from the Canary Islands. Even though Spain imposed many restrictions on wine production and commerce, the wine-making industry developed rapidly, such as in the corregimientos of Ica.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Pisco_peru.jpg/230px-Pisco_peru.jpg
