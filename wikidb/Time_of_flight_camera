1.00	Time_of_flight_camera	Time-of-flight camera	The simplest version of a time-of-flight camera uses light pulses. The illumination is switched on for a very short time, the resulting light pulse illuminates the scene and is reflected by the objects. The camera lens gathers the reflected light and images it onto the sensor plane. Depending on the distance, the incoming light experiences a delay. As light has a speed of approximately c = 300,000,000 meters per second, this delay is very short: an object 2.5 m away will delay the light by:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/TOF-camera-principle.jpg/220px-TOF-camera-principle.jpg
