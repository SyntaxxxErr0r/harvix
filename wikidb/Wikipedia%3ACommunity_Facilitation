1.00	Wikipedia%3ACommunity_Facilitation	Wikipedia:Community Facilitation	Welcome to WikiProject Community Facilitation. The Wikipedians who have formed this group are dedicated to improving the decision making process of the Wikipedia community. This project organizes information and facilitates discussions on important community-wide issues. This page outlines how the group functions, and how it organizes itself. It is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of all Wikipedians who are interested in helping organize the community. This project is open to everyone. If you would like to help, please join the project, inquire on the talk page and see the to-do list below.
