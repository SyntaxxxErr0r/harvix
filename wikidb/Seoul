It continued as the capital of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty and the Korean Empire. The Seoul National Capital Area is home to four UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeokgung, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty. Seoul is the world's greenest major city, with over 27% of the city dedicated to public parks such as Namsan Park, home to the N Seoul Tower.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Seoul_Landmark_Montage.jpg/320px-Seoul_Landmark_Montage.jpg
