89.1	Make_(software)	Make (software)	In software development, Make is a utility that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. Though integrated development environments and language-specific compiler features can also be used to manage the build process in modern systems, Make remains widely used, especially in Unix.
