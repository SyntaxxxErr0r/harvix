7.00	Clan_(car)	Clan (car)	The Clan Crusader was a fibreglass monocoque British sports car based on running gear from the Hillman Imp Sport, including its Coventry Climax derived, rear-mounted 875 cc engine. It was first made in Washington, Co Durham, England, between 1971 and 1974, but since then several efforts have been made to bring the car back to production. Plans were made by Martin Phaff (of previous Ginetta fame) to re-resurrect the Clan in 2009, but nothing seems to have come of the project so far.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/1972-Clan_Crusader.JPG/250px-1972-Clan_Crusader.JPG
