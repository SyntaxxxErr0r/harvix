29.86	Bottom_quark	Bottom quark	The bottom quark or b quark (from its symbol, b), also known as the beauty quark, is a third-generation quark with a charge of âˆ’ e. Although all quarks are described in a similar way by the quantum chromodynamics, the bottom quark's large bare mass (around , a bit more than four times the mass of a proton), combined with low values of the CKM matrix elements Vub and Vcb, gives it a distinctive signature that makes it relatively easy to identify experimentally (using a technique called B-tagging). Because three generations of quark are required for CP violation (see CKM matrix), mesons containing the bottom quark are the easiest particles to use to investigate the phenomenon; such experiments are being performed at the BaBar and Belle experiments. The bottom quark is also notable because it is a product in almost all top quark decays, and would be a frequent decay product for the hypothetical Higgs boson if it is sufficiently light.
