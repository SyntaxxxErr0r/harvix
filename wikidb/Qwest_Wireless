3.10	Qwest_Wireless	Qwest Wireless	Owned by Qwest Communications, Qwest Wireless LLC is a cellular phone service offered in the United States. Qwest Wireless is a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) that currently operates on Verizon Wireless' CDMA network. While Qwest originally owned its own wireless network, it discontinued that network in 2004 as part of the move to become an MVNO. The network elements were sold to other carriers after shutdown. Qwest was the only Baby Bell that offered its wireless service as an MVNO; Since the wireless company used Sprint's network, most of their phones were Sprint phones with the Qwest name on them. Their phones included models from Sanyo, Samsung, Nokia, UT Starcom (formerly Audiovox), HTC, and Motorola. Qwest Wireless ended the year 2007 with 824,000 wireless subscribers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Qwest.svg/200px-Qwest.svg.png
