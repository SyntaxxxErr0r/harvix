10.13	Geology_of_the_Alps	Geology of the Alps	The Alps form part of a Tertiary orogenic belt of mountain chains, called the Alpide belt, that stretches through southern Europe and Asia from the Atlantic all the way to the Himalayas. This belt of mountain chains was formed during the Alpine orogeny. A gap in these mountain chains in central Europe separates the Alps from the Carpathians to the east. Orogeny took place continuously and tectonic subsidence has produced the gaps in between.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Alpe_Mali_Dru.jpg/190px-Alpe_Mali_Dru.jpg
