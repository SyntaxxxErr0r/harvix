91.1	Ich_bin_ein_Berliner	Ich bin ein Berliner	"Ich bin ein Berliner" (German pronunciation: , "I am a Berliner") is a quotation from a June 26, 1963, speech by U.S. President John F. Kennedy in West Berlin. He was underlining the support of the United States for West Germany 22 months after the Soviet-supported East Germany erected the Berlin Wall as a barrier to prevent movement between East and West. The message was aimed as much at the Soviets as it was at Berliners, and was a clear statement of U.S. policy in the wake of the construction of the Berlin Wall. Another notable (and defiant) phrase in the speech was also spoken in German, "Lass' sie nach Berlin kommen" ("Let them come to Berlin")--addressed at those who claimed "we can work with the Communists", a remark which Nikita Khrushchev scoffed at only days later.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Berlin_Blockade-map.svg/220px-Berlin_Blockade-map.svg.png
