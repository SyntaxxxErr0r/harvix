62.1	Farmer	Farmer	A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, who raises living organisms for food or raw materials, generally including livestock husbandry and growing crops, such as produce and grain. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are farm workers, farmhands, etc.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Old_farmer_woman.JPG/220px-Old_farmer_woman.JPG
