1.00	Machinist_square	Machinist square	A machinist square or engineer's square is the metalworkers' equivalent of a try square. It consists of a steel blade inserted and either welded or pinned into a heavier body at an angle of 90Â°. In the accompanying image, there is evidence of pinning at the intersection of the blade and body: the heads of three pins are visible as dark circles. A small notch has been added to the inside corner of the square to prevent small particles from accumulating and affecting the square's reading. This notch is typical of machinist squares and is occasionally found on carpentry squares as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/SquareEngineersMachinist.jpg/300px-SquareEngineersMachinist.jpg
