191.3	Grace_Hopper	Grace Hopper	Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 â€“ January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy officer. A pioneer in the field, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and developed the first compiler for a computer programming language. She conceptualized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first modern programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches (motivated by an actual moth removed from the computer). Due to the breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace." The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Grace_Hopper.jpg/300px-Grace_Hopper.jpg
