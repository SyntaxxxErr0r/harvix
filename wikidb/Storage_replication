7.20	Storage_replication	Replication (computing)	Active (real-time) storage replication is usually implemented by distributing updates of a block device to several physical hard disks. This way, any file system supported by the operating system can be replicated without modification, as the file system code works on a level above the block device driver layer. It is implemented either in hardware (in a disk array controller) or in software (in a device driver).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Storage_replication.png/220px-Storage_replication.png
