2.40	Corporate_Finance	Corporate finance	Corporate finance is the area of finance dealing with monetary decisions that business enterprises make and the tools and analysis used to make these decisions. The primary goal of corporate finance is to maximize shareholder value. Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial decisions of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Panorama_clip3.jpg/140px-Panorama_clip3.jpg
