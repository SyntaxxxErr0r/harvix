2.00	Bantam_in_Pine-Woods	Bantam in Pine-Woods	This poem can be read as a little declaration of independence for American poetry. The new world's inchling poets are defiant towards the traditional literary canon, confident of their powers in the New World. The poem can be compared to The Paltry Nude Starts on a Spring Voyage" on Helen Vendler's interpretation of it as an expression of confidence in new American art. On this reading Chieftan Iffucan represents the canon, making a claim to universality and a privileged access to inspiration that is challenged by the Appalachian inchlings. The richness of tradition is conceded ("Fat!...."), but it is relativized ("Your world is you.").
