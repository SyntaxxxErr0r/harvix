51.0	Moringa_oleifera	Moringa oleifera	Moringa oleifera is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Moringa, which is the only genus in the family Moringaceae. English common names include moringa, benzolive tree, and West Indian ben. It is also known as drumstick tree, from the appearance of the long, slender, triangular seed pods, horseradish tree, from the taste of the roots which resembles horseradish, or Ben oil tree, from the oil derived from the seeds. It is an exceptionally nutritious vegetable tree with a variety of potential uses. The tree itself is rather slender, with drooping branches that grow to approximately 10 m in height. In cultivation, it is often cut back annually to 1 meter or less and allowed to regrow so that pods and leaves remain within arm's reach.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Moringa_oleifera_flower_edit.jpg/220px-Moringa_oleifera_flower_edit.jpg
