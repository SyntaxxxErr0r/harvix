72.2	Suez_Crisis	Suez Crisis	The Suez Crisis, also referred to as the Tripartite Aggression or Suez War (Arabic: ‎ ; French: ; Hebrew: ‎ "Operation Kadesh," or , "Sinai War"), was a diplomatic and military confrontation in late 1956 between Egypt on one side, and Britain, France and Israel on the other, with the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations playing major roles in forcing Britain, France and Israel to withdraw. Less than a day after Israel invaded Egypt, Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to Egypt and Israel, and then began to bomb Cairo. Despite the denials of the Israeli, British and French governments, evidence began to emerge that the invasion of Egypt had been planned beforehand by the three powers. Anglo-French forces withdrew before the end of the year, but Israeli forces remained until March 1957, prolonging the crisis. In April, the canal was fully reopened to shipping, but other repercussions followed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Tanks_Destroyed_Sinai.jpg/250px-Tanks_Destroyed_Sinai.jpg
