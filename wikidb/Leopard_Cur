1.30	Leopard_Cur	Catahoula Cur	The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog or Catahoula Cur is an American dog breed. It is named after Catahoula Parish in the state of Louisiana in the United States. The Catahoula is believed to have occupied North America the next longest after the dogs descended from Native American-created breeds. The breed is sometimes referred to as the "Catahoula Hound" or "Catahoula Leopard Hound", although it is not a true hound, but a cur. It is also called the "Catahoula Hog Dog", reflecting its traditional use in hunting wild boar.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Iougtyfgh.jpg/220px-Iougtyfgh.jpg
