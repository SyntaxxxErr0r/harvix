170.2	LGBT	LGBT	LGBT is an initialism that collectively refers to "lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender" people. In use since the 1990s, the term "LGBT" is an adaptation of the initialism "LGB", which itself started replacing the phrase "gay community" beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s, which many within the community in question felt did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred. The initialism has become mainstream as a self-designation and has been adopted by the majority "sexuality and gender identity-based" community centers and media in the United States and some other English-speaking countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Palco_BolognaPride08.jpg/220px-Palco_BolognaPride08.jpg
