6.21	Scout_sign_and_salute	Scout sign and salute	The three-finger salute is used by members of Scout and Guide organizations around the world when greeting other Scouts and in respect of a national flag at ceremonies. In most situations, the salute is made with the palm face out, the thumb holding down the little finger, and with the fingertips on the brow of the head. There are some variations of the salute between national Scouting organisations and also within some programme sections.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Plast_-_Scout_Salute.jpg/220px-Plast_-_Scout_Salute.jpg
