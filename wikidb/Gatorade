54.4	Gatorade	Gatorade	Gatorade is a brand of sports-themed food and beverage products, built around its signature product: a line of sports drinks. Gatorade is currently manufactured by PepsiCo and distributed in over 80 countries. The beverage was first developed in 1965 by researchers at the University of Florida, to replenish the combination of water, carbohydrates, and electrolytes that the school's student-athletes lost (in sweat) during rigorous athletic competitions. Its name was derived from the collective nickname of the university's athletic teams, "the Gators".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3e/GatoradeGlogoconverted.svg/200px-GatoradeGlogoconverted.svg.png
