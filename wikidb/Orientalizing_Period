4.00	Orientalizing_Period	Orientalizing period	In the history of ancient Greece, the Orientalizing period is the cultural and art historical period informed by the art of Anatolia, Syria, Assyria, Phoenicia and Egypt, which started during the later part of the 7th century BCE. It encompasses a new, Orientalizing style, spurred by a period of increased cultural interchange in the Aegean world. The period is characterized by a shift from the prevailing Geometric style to a style with different sensibilities, which were inspired by the East. The intensity of the cultural interchange during this period is sometimes compared to that of the Late Bronze Age.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Loutrophoros_Analatos_Louvre_CA2985_n2.jpg/220px-Loutrophoros_Analatos_Louvre_CA2985_n2.jpg
