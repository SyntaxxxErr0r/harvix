112.6	Polenta	Polenta	Polenta is coarsely or finely ground yellow or white cornmeal (ground maize) used as a foodstuff. It is cooked by boiling to a paste in water or a liquid such as soup stock, and may be eaten with other ingredients. After boiling it may be baked or fried; left-over polenta is often used this way. As is common with many foods, the term may refer to the ingredient or a cooked dish made with it (as with rice, beans, etc.).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Polenta_con_sopressa_e_funghi.jpg/300px-Polenta_con_sopressa_e_funghi.jpg
