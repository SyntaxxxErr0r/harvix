62.9	Chianti	Chianti	Chianti is a red Italian wine produced in Tuscany. It was historically associated with a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a fiasco ("flask"; pl. fiaschi); however, the fiasco is only used by a few makers of the wine now; most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles. Baron Bettino Ricasoli (later Prime Minister in the Kingdom of Italy) created the Chianti recipe of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo and 15% Malvasia bianca in the middle of the nineteenth century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Fiasco_di_chianti_monteriggioni.jpg/220px-Fiasco_di_chianti_monteriggioni.jpg
