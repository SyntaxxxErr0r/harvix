132.7	Consumerism	Consumerism	Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages the purchase of goods and services in ever-greater amounts. The term is often associated with criticisms of consumption starting with Thorstein Veblen. Veblen's subject of examination, the newly emergent middle class arising at the turn of the twentieth century, comes to full fruition by the end of the twentieth century through the process of globalization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Mall_culture_jakarta35.jpg/220px-Mall_culture_jakarta35.jpg
