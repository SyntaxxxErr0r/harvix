4.00	Burmese_Kingdom	History of Burma	The history of Burma (Myanmar) covers the period from the time of first-known human settlements 13,000 years ago to the present day. The earliest inhabitants of recorded history were the Pyu who entered the Irrawaddy valley from Yunnan c. 2nd century BCE. By the 4th century CE, the Pyu had founded several city states as far south as Prome (Pyay), and adopted Buddhism. Farther south, the Mon, who had entered from Haribhunjaya and Dvaravati kingdoms in the east, had established city states of their own along the Lower Burmese coastline by the early 9th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/WikiProject_Burma_%28Myanmar%29_peacock.svg/100px-WikiProject_Burma_%28Myanmar%29_peacock.svg.png
