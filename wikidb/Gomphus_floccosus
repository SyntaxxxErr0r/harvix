2.10	Gomphus_floccosus	Gomphus floccosus	Gomphus floccosus, sometimes known as the shaggy-, scaly-, or woolly chanterelle or woolly gomphus, is a cantharelloid mushroom. The genus has been determined to be polyphyletic, which will more than likely lead to this species being renamed in the future. It forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with various types of conifer; fruiting bodies may be found in coniferous woodlands across Eastern Asia, from Korea to Pakistan, and in North America, more frequently in the west, in late summer and autumn. The orange-capped vase- or trumpet-shaped fruiting structures may reach 20 cm (8 in) high and 15 cm (6 in) wide; though mild tasting, they cause gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea when consumed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Gomphus_floccosus_6051.JPG/235px-Gomphus_floccosus_6051.JPG
