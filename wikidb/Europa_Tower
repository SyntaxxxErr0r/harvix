3.20	Europa_Tower	Europa Tower	The Europa Tower (Lithuanian: ) is the tallest skyscraper in the Baltic states. It is located in a district of Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, called Šnipiškės. It rises 148 meters above ground level. It was designed by the Vilnius based, Audrius Ambrasas Architects Company. Dominating the skyline of the newly developing New City Center, the building was completed and officially opened on 1 May 2004, as part of Lithuania's celebrations upon entering the European Union. The skyscraper caused some controversy among some of the public and some watch-dog groups because of its interference with the historic skyline of the Vilnius' Old Town. Despite varying opinions, the tower is now often regarded as a modern landmark of the Lithuanian capital. There is an observation deck on the open roof terrace at 114 m (374 ft).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Europa_Tower.Vilnius.Lithuania.JPG/250px-Europa_Tower.Vilnius.Lithuania.JPG
