109.2	Public_good	Public good	In economics, a public good is a good that is non-rivalrous and non-excludable. Non-rivalry means that consumption of the good by one individual does not reduce availability of the good for consumption by others; and non-excludability means that no one can be effectively excluded from using the good. In the real world, there may be no such thing as an absolutely non-rivalrous and non-excludable good; but economists think that some goods approximate the concept closely enough for the analysis to be economically useful.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Samuelson_condition.png/220px-Samuelson_condition.png
