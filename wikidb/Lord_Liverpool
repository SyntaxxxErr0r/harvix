7.12	Lord_Liverpool	Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool	Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool KG PC (7 June 1770 â€“ 4 December 1828) was a British politician and the longest-serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since the Union with Ireland in 1801. He was 42 years old when he became premier in 1812 which made him younger than all of his successors to date. During his time as Prime Minister from 1812 to 1827, Liverpool became known for repressive measures introduced to maintain order, but also for steering the country through the period of radicalism and unrest that followed the Napoleonic Wars.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Lord_Liverpool.jpg/245px-Lord_Liverpool.jpg
