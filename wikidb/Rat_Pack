65.9	Rat_Pack	Rat Pack	The Rat Pack was a group of actors originally centered on Humphrey Bogart. In the mid-1960s it was the name used by the press and the general public to refer to a later variation of the group, after Bogart's death, that called itself "the summit" or "the clan," featuring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, and finally, Joey Bishop, who appeared together on stage and in films in the early-1960s, including the movie Ocean's 11. Sinatra, Martin and Davis were regarded as the group's lead members.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Sabrina9.jpg/220px-Sabrina9.jpg
