57.8	Rambutan	Rambutan	The rambutan (taxonomic name: Nephelium lappaceum) is a medium-sized tropical tree in the family Sapindaceae. The fruit produced by the tree is also known as "rambutan." It is native to Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, although its precise natural distribution is unknown. It is closely related to several other edible tropical fruits including the lychee, longan, and mamoncillo. It is believed to be native to the Malay Archipelago, from where it spread westwards to Thailand, Burma, Sri Lanka and India; eastwards to Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia. The name rambutan is derived from the Malay word rambutan, meaning "hairy". In Vietnam, it is called chôm chôm (meaning "messy hair") due to the spines covering the fruit's skin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Rambutan_white_background_alt.jpg/220px-Rambutan_white_background_alt.jpg
