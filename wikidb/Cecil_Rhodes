He was the founder of the diamond company De Beers, which today markets 40% of the world's rough diamonds and at one time marketed 90%. An ardent believer in British colonial imperialism, he was the founder of the state of Rhodesia, which was named after him. In 1964, Northern Rhodesia became the independent state of Zambia and Southern Rhodesia was thereafter known simply as Rhodesia. In 1980, Rhodesia, which had been de-facto independent since 1965, was granted independence by Britain and was renamed Zimbabwe. South Africa's Rhodes University is also named after Cecil Rhodes. He set up the provisions of the Rhodes Scholarship, which is funded by his estate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Cecil_Rhodes_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16600.jpg/260px-Cecil_Rhodes_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16600.jpg
