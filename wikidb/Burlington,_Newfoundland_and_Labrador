3.20	Burlington,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador	Burlington, Newfoundland and Labrador	Burlington is an incorporated town located at the north side of the mouth of Green Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Burlington, once named Northwest Arm, is a small fishing and lumbering community that was permanently settled in the mid-19th century. The community was renamed in the early part of 1915 due to a mix-up in the mail service. After many residents complained that their mail was sent to another community with a similar name, the town leaders felt the need to have a name change. Out of three separate entries, 'Burlington' was chosen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Newfoundland_map.png/250px-Newfoundland_map.png
