95.5	African_Union	African Union	The African Union (abbreviated AU in English, and UA in its other official languages) is a union consisting of 54 African states. The only all-African state not in the AU is Morocco. Established on 9 July 2002, the AU was formed as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The most important decisions of the AU are made by the Assembly of the African Union, a semi-annual meeting of the heads of state and government of its member states. The AU's secretariat, the African Union Commission, is based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Flag_of_the_African_Union.svg/125px-Flag_of_the_African_Union.svg.png
