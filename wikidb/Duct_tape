108.5	Duct_tape	Duct tape	Duct tape, or duck tape, is cloth- or scrim-backed pressure sensitive tape often sealed with polyethylene. It is very similar to gaffer tape but differs in that gaffer tape was designed to be cleanly removed, while duct tape was not. It is generally silver or black but also available in other colors. In 1942 Revolite, formerly a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson, originally developed an adhesive tape made from a rubber-based adhesive applied to a durable duck cloth backing. This tape resisted water and was used as sealing tape on ammunition cases during World War II. Because of these properties, it was also used to repair military equipment quickly, including jeeps, firearms, and aircraft.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Duct-tape.jpg/300px-Duct-tape.jpg
