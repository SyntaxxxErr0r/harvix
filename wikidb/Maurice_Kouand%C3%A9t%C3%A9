He was born to Somba parents in the Gaba District of Dahomey. Kouandété enrolled in the army in his late teens. Over the years, he became popular among junior soldiers in the north and gained the contempt of those in the south. Jim Hoagland of The Washington Post described Kouandété as a "moody, brilliant and highly ambitious soldier".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Maurice_Kouand%C3%A9t%C3%A9.gif/220px-Maurice_Kouand%C3%A9t%C3%A9.gif
