Pendergrass first rose to fame as lead singer of Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes in the 1970s before a successful solo career at the end of the decade. In 1982, he was severely injured in an auto accident in Philadelphia, resulting in his being paralyzed from the waist down. After his injury, the affable entertainer founded the Teddy Pendergrass Alliance, a foundation that helps those with spinal cord injuries. Pendergrass commemorated 25 years of living after his spinal cord injury with star filled event, Teddy 25 - A Celebration of Life at Philadelphia's Kimmel Center. His last performance was on a PBS special at Atlantic City's Borgata Casino in November 2008.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/Teddy_Pendergrass_1970.jpg/220px-Teddy_Pendergrass_1970.jpg
