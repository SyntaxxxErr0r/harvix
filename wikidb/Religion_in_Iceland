7.31	Religion_in_Iceland	Religion in Iceland	Religion in Iceland was initially the Norse paganism that was a common belief among mediaeval Scandinavians until Christian conversion. Later, the nation became half-Christian and then more fully Christian. This increasing Christianization culminated in the Pietism period when non-Christian entertainments were discouraged. At present, the population is overwhelmingly, if nominally, Lutheran. However, Baptist, Catholic, Jehovah's Witness, Bahá'í, neopagan, Mormon, Muslim and other faiths exist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/SkalholtChurchInterior.jpg/250px-SkalholtChurchInterior.jpg
