70.8	Lynx	Lynx	A lynx (plural lynx or lynxes) is any of the four Lynx genus species of medium-sized wildcats. The name "lynx" originated in Middle English via Latin from Greek word "λύγξ", derived from the Indo-European root "*leuk-", meaning "light, brightness", in reference to the luminescence of its reflective eyes. There is considerable confusion about the best way to classify felids at present, and some authorities classify them as part of the genus Felis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Lynx_lynx_poing.jpg/220px-Lynx_lynx_poing.jpg
