7.00	Maoris	Māori people	The Māori are the native or indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand. They arrived in New Zealand from eastern Polynesia in several waves at some time before 1300 CE. Over several centuries in isolation, the Māori developed a unique culture with their own language, a rich mythology, distinctive crafts and performing arts. They formed a tribal society based on East Polynesian social customs and organisation. Horticulture flourished using plants they introduced, and after about 1450 a prominent warrior culture emerged.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Polynesian_Migration.svg/220px-Polynesian_Migration.svg.png
