238.4	Manhattan	Manhattan	Manhattan is the oldest and the most densely populated of the five boroughs of New York City. Located primarily on the island of Manhattan at the mouth of the Hudson River, the boundaries of the borough are identical to those of New York County, an original county of the state of New York. The borough and county consist of Manhattan Island and several small adjacent islands: Roosevelt Island, Randall's Island, Wards Island, Governors Island, Liberty Island, part of Ellis Island, Mill Rock, and U Thant Island; as well as Marble Hill, a very small area on the mainland bordering the Bronx. The original city of New York began at the southern end of Manhattan, expanded northwards, and then between 1874 and 1898, annexed land from surrounding counties.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/NYC_wideangle_south_from_Top_of_the_Rock.jpg/250px-NYC_wideangle_south_from_Top_of_the_Rock.jpg
