The family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including woodchucks), flying squirrels, and prairie dogs. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and have been introduced to Australia. The earliest known squirrels date from the Eocene and are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormouse among living species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Sciuridae.jpg/240px-Sciuridae.jpg
