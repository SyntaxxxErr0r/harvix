56.6	Parallax_barrier	Parallax barrier	A parallax barrier is a device placed in front of an image source, such as a liquid crystal display, to allow it to show a stereoscopic image or multiscopic image without the need for the viewer to wear 3D glasses. Placed in front of the normal LCD, it consists of a layer of material with a series of precision slits, allowing each eye to see a different set of pixels, so creating a sense of depth through parallax in an effect similar to what lenticular printing produces for printed products. A disadvantage of the technology is that the viewer must be positioned in a well-defined spot to experience the 3D effect. Another disadvantage is that the effective horizontal pixel count viewable for each eye is reduced by one half; however, there is research attempting to improve these limitations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Parallax_barrier_vs_lenticular_screen.svg/220px-Parallax_barrier_vs_lenticular_screen.svg.png
