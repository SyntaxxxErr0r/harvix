2.00	Magnetic_polarity	Magnet	A magnet (from Greek , "Magnesian stone") is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/MagnetEZ.jpg/220px-MagnetEZ.jpg
