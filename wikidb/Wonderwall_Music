20.40	Wonderwall_Music	Wonderwall Music	Wonderwall Music is George Harrison's first solo album and the soundtrack to the film Wonderwall. The songs are virtually all instrumental, except for some non-English vocals and a slowed-down spoken word track. The songs were recorded in December 1967 in England, and January 1968 in Bombay, India. Wonderwall Music is notable for being the first official solo album by one of the Beatles as well as Apple Records' first LP release. The album is currently out of print.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/75/Sapcor1_a.jpg/220px-Sapcor1_a.jpg
