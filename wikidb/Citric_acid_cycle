66.1	Citric_acid_cycle	Citric acid cycle	The citric acid cycle — also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle , the Krebs cycle, or the Szent-Györgyi–Krebs cycle — is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy through the oxidization of acetate derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide and water. In addition, the cycle provides precursors for the biosynthesis of compounds including certain amino acids as well as the reducing agent NADH that is used in numerous biochemical reactions. Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism and may have originated abiogenically.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Citric_acid_cycle_with_aconitate_2.svg/500px-Citric_acid_cycle_with_aconitate_2.svg.png
