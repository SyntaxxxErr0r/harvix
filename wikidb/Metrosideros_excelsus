The Pōhutukawa is one of twelve Metrosideros species endemic to New Zealand. Renowned for its vibrant colour and its ability to survive even perched on rocky, precarious cliffs, it has found an important place in New Zealand culture for its strength and beauty and is regarded as a chiefly tree (rākau rangatira) by Māori.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/PohutukawaCornwallis.jpg/220px-PohutukawaCornwallis.jpg
