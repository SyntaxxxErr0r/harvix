23.66	V-Model_(software_development)	V-Model (software development)	The V-model represents a software development process (also applicable to hardware development) which may be considered an extension of the waterfall model. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing. The horizontal and vertical axes represents time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Systems_Engineering_Process_II.svg/420px-Systems_Engineering_Process_II.svg.png
