6.00	Roman_rite	Roman Rite	The Roman Rite is the liturgical rite used in the Diocese of Rome in the Catholic Church. It is by far the most widespread of the Latin liturgical rites used within the Western or Latin autonomous particular Church, the particular Church that itself is also called the Latin Rite, and that is one of 23 particular churches in full communion with the Bishop of Rome. Like virtually all other liturgical rites, the Roman Rite has grown and been adapted over the centuries. The development of its Eucharistic liturgy can be divided into three stages: Pre-Tridentine, Tridentine, and the Post-Tridentine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Santa_Cecilia.jpg/220px-Santa_Cecilia.jpg
