51.3	Autostereoscopy	Autostereoscopy	Autostereoscopy is any method of displaying stereoscopic images (adding binocular perception of 3D depth) without the use of special headgear or glasses on the part of the viewer. Because headgear is not required, it is also called "glasses-free 3D" or "glassesless 3D". There are two broad approaches currently used to accommodate motion parallax and wider viewing angles: eye-tracking, and multiple views so that the display does not need to sense where the viewers' eyes are located. Examples of autostereoscopic displays include parallax barrier, lenticular, volumetric, electro-holographic, and light field displays.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Nintendo-3DS-AquaOpen.png/250px-Nintendo-3DS-AquaOpen.png
