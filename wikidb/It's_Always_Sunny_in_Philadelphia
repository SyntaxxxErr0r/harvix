New episodes continue to air on FX, with reruns playing on Comedy Central, general broadcast syndication, and WGN Americaâ€”the first-ever cable-to-cable syndication deal for a sitcom. The show was created, developed, and produced by Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day, who also star in the show. The series follows the exploits of "The Gang", a group of self-centered friends who run Paddy's Pub, a relatively unsuccessful Irish bar in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/IASIPTC.png/250px-IASIPTC.png
