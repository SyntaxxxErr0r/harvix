99.3	Milli_Vanilli	Milli Vanilli	Milli Vanilli was a pop and dance project created by Frank Farian in Munich, Germany, in 1988. The group was formed with Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus. The group's debut album Girl You Know It's True achieved international success and earned them a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on February 21, 1990. Milli Vanilli became one of the most popular pop acts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, their success turned to infamy when their Grammy was revoked after it was revealed that the lead vocals on the record were not the actual voices of Morvan and Pilatus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Milli_Vanilli_and_C._Michael_Greene.jpg/220px-Milli_Vanilli_and_C._Michael_Greene.jpg
