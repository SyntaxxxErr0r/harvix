71.6	Life_insurance	Life insurance	Life insurance is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer, where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money (the "benefits") upon the death of the insured person. Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness may also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as a lump sum. Other expenses (such as funeral expenses) are also sometimes included in the premium; however, in Australia the predominant form simply specifies a lump sum to be paid on the policy holder's death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/2005life_premia.PNG/220px-2005life_premia.PNG
