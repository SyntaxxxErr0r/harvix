Roads consist of one, or sometimes two, roadways (British English: carriageways) each with one or more lanes and also any associated sidewalks (British English: pavement) and road verges. Roads that are available for use by the public may be referred to as public roads or highways.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Evacuated_Highway_401_Color.jpg/250px-Evacuated_Highway_401_Color.jpg
