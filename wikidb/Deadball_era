1.00	Deadball_era	Dead-ball era	The dead-ball era is a baseball term used to describe the period between 1900 (though some date it to the beginning of baseball) and the emergence of Babe Ruth as a power hitter in 1919. In 1919, Ruth hit a then league record 29 home runs, a spectacular feat at that time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Ray_Caldwell_pitching_in_the_first_game_at_Ebbets_Field%2C_April_5%2C_1913.jpg/300px-Ray_Caldwell_pitching_in_the_first_game_at_Ebbets_Field%2C_April_5%2C_1913.jpg
