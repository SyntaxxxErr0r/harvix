76.3	Muscle_memory	Muscle memory	Muscle memory has been used synonymously with motor learning, which is a form of procedural memory that involves consolidating a specific motor task into memory through repetition. When a movement is repeated over time, a long-term muscle memory is created for that task, eventually allowing it to be performed without conscious effort. This process decreases the need for attention and creates maximum efficiency within the motor and memory systems. Examples of muscle memory improve's with practice, Providing a certain feel onto a muscle will inflict a memory of the feel and that muscle movement will continue without conscious effort activities such as Basketball, riding a bicycle, typing on a keyboard, typing in a PIN, playing a melody or phrase on a musical instrument, playing video games, or performing different algorithms for a puzzle cube.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/US_Navy_071017-N-0995C-008_Chief_Mineman_Kevin_Sperling%2C_an_officer_recruiter_at_Navy_Recruiting_Processing_Station_Honolulu%2C_presses_two_105-pound_dumbbells.jpg/220px-US_Navy_071017-N-0995C-008_Chief_Mineman_Kevin_Sperling%2C_an_officer_recruiter_at_Navy_Recruiting_Processing_Station_Honolulu%2C_presses_two_105-pound_dumbbells.jpg
