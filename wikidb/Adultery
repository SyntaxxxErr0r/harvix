68.0	Adultery	Adultery	Adultery (also called philandery or cheating, anglicized from Latin adulterium) is sexual infidelity to one's spouse, and is a form of extramarital sex. Some religious interpretation and state laws go as far as to say that even in cases of separation from one's spouse, an extramarital affair is still considered adultery.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Man_and_woman_undergoing_public_exposure_for_adultery_in_Japan-J._M._W._Silver.jpg/220px-Man_and_woman_undergoing_public_exposure_for_adultery_in_Japan-J._M._W._Silver.jpg
