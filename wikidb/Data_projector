3.00	Data_projector	Video projector	A video projector is an image projector that receives a video signal and projects the corresponding image on a projection screen using a lens system. All video projectors use a very bright light to project the image, and most modern ones can correct any curves, blurriness, and other inconsistencies through manual settings. Video projectors are widely used for many applications such as, conference room presentations, classroom training, home theatre and concerts. Projectors are widely used in many schools and other educational settings, sometimes connected to an interactive whiteboard to interactively teach pupils.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Projection-screen-home2.jpg/220px-Projection-screen-home2.jpg
