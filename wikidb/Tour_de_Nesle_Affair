The Tour de Nesle was the name of the tower in Paris where much of the adultery was said to have occurred. The scandal led to torture, executions and imprisonments, with lasting consequences for the final years of the Capetian dynasty.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/Philip_iv_and_family.jpg/300px-Philip_iv_and_family.jpg
