67.5	Hidden_Markov_model	Hidden Markov model	In its discrete form, a hidden Markov process can be visualized as a generalization of the Urn problem: A genie is in a room that is not visible to an observer. In this hidden room there are urns X1, X2, X3, ... each of which contains a known mix of balls, each ball labeled y1, y2, y3, ... . The genie chooses an urn in that room and randomly draws a ball from that urn. It then puts the ball onto a conveyor belt, where the observer can observe the sequence of the balls but not the sequence of urns from which they were drawn. The genie has some procedure to choose urns; the choice of the urn for the n-th ball depends only upon a random number and the choice of the urn for the (n âˆ’ 1)-th ball. The choice of urn does not directly depend on the urns chosen before this single previous urn; therefore, this is called a Markov process. It can be described by the upper part of Figure 1.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/HiddenMarkovModel.svg/300px-HiddenMarkovModel.svg.png
