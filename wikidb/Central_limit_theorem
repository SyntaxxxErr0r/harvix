85.5	Central_limit_theorem	Central limit theorem	In probability theory, the central limit theorem states that, given certain conditions, the mean of a sufficiently large number of independent random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will be approximately normally distributed. The central limit theorem has a number of variants. In its common form, the random variables must be identically distributed. In variants, convergence of the mean to the normal distribution also occurs for non-identical distributions, given that they comply with certain conditions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Dice_sum_central_limit_theorem.svg/250px-Dice_sum_central_limit_theorem.svg.png
