1.21	Coat_of_arms_of_the_Cayman_Islands	Coat of arms of the Cayman Islands	The Cayman Islands’ coat of arms consists of a shield, a crested helm and the motto. Three green stars, representing each of the three inhabited Islands , are set in the lower two-thirds of the shield. The stars rest on blue and white wavy bands representing the sea. In the top third of the shield, against a red background, is a gold lion passant guardant (walking with the further forepaw raised and the body seen from the side), representing Britain. Above the shield is a green turtle on a coil of rope. Behind the turtle is a gold pineapple. The turtle represents the Caymans’ seafaring history; the rope, its traditional thatch-rope industry; and the pineapple, its ties with Jamaica.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Coat_of_arms_of_Cayman_Islands.svg/200px-Coat_of_arms_of_Cayman_Islands.svg.png
