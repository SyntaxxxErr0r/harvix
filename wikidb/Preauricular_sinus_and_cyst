2.00	Preauricular_sinus_and_cyst	Preauricular sinus and cyst	A preauricular sinus or cyst (also known as a "Congenital auricular fistula," "Congenital preauricular fistula," "Ear pit":782, and "Preauricular cyst" ) is a common congenital malformation characterized by a nodule, dent or dimple located anywhere adjacent to the external ear. They are inherited features and usually appear on one side, but may be bilateral in 25-50% of cases. Preauricular sinuses and cysts result from developmental defects of the first and second branchial arches. Occasionally a preauricular sinus or a cyst can become infected.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Preauricularsinus.jpg/230px-Preauricularsinus.jpg
