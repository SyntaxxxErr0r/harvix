18.84	Gnathostomata	Gnathostomata	Gnathostomata ( ) is the group of vertebrates with jaws. The term derives from Greek γνάθος "jaw" + στόμα (stoma) "mouth". Gnathostome diversity comprises roughly 60,000 species, which accounts for 99% of all living vertebrates. In addition to opposing jaws, living gnathostomes also have teeth, paired appendages, and a horizontal semicircular canal of the inner ear, along with physiological and cellular anatomical characters such as the myelin sheathes of neurons. Another is an adaptive immune system that uses V(D)J recombination to create antigen recognition sites, rather than using genetic recombination in the Variable lymphocyte receptor gene.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Orca-Sch%C3%A4del.jpg/200px-Orca-Sch%C3%A4del.jpg
