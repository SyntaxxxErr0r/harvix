71.1	Rule_of_thumb	Rule of thumb	It is often claimed incorrectly that the term's etymological origin lies in a law that limited the maximum thickness of a stick with which it was permissible for a man to beat his wife. British common law before the reign of Charles II permitted a man to give his wife "moderate correction", but no "rule of thumb" (whether called by this name or not) has ever been the law in England. Such "moderate correction" specifically excluded beatings, allowing the husband only to confine a wife to the household.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Judge_Thumb.jpg/220px-Judge_Thumb.jpg
