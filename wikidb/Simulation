78.6	Simulation	Simulation	Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Horse_simulator_WWI.jpg/240px-Horse_simulator_WWI.jpg
