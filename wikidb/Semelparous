4.02	Semelparous	Semelparity and iteroparity	The word semelparity comes from the Latin semel, once, and pario, to beget. It is also known as "big bang" reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large, as well as fatal. A classic example of a semelparous organism is Pacific salmon , and some species of bamboo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Oncorhynchus_nerka_2.jpg/220px-Oncorhynchus_nerka_2.jpg
