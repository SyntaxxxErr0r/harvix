2.10	Man-to-man_wargame	Man-to-man wargame	Man-to-man wargames (also known as skirmish wargames) are wargames in which units generally represent single individuals or weapons systems, and are rated not only on weaponry but may also be rated on such facets as morale, perception, skill-at-arms, etc. The games are designed so that a knowledge of military tactics, especially at the small unit or squad level, will facilitate successful gameplay. Man-to-man wargames offer an extreme challenge to the designer, as fewer variables or characteristics inherent in the units being simulated are directly quantifiable. Modern commercial board wargaming stayed away from man-to-man subjects for many years, though once the initial attempts were made to address the subject, it has evolved into a popular topic among wargamers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Battle_Trebia-en.svg/150px-Battle_Trebia-en.svg.png
