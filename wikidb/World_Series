95.7	World_Series	World Series	The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball, played between the American League and National League champions since 1903. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff and awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Because the World Series is played in October, it is sometimes called the Fall Classic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/2004_WorldSeries_Trophy.jpg/220px-2004_WorldSeries_Trophy.jpg
