1.00	Intercalated_disk	Intercalated disc	When observing cardiac muscle tissue through a microscope, intercalated discs are an identifying feature of cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle consists of single heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) which have to be connected by intercalated discs to work as a functional organ. By contrast, skeletal muscle consists of multinucleated muscle fibers and therefore exhibit no intercalated discs. Intercalated discs support synchronised contraction of cardiac tissue. They can easily be visualized by a longitudinal section of the tissue.
