19.54	Platt_Amendment	Platt Amendment	The Platt Amendment of 1901 was an amendment to a joint resolution of the United States Congress, replacing the earlier Teller Amendment. It stipulated the conditions for the withdrawal of United States troops remaining in Cuba at the end of the Spanish-American War and defined the terms of Cuban-U.S. relations until the 1934 Treaty of Relations. The Amendment ensured U.S. involvement in Cuban affairs and gave legal standing (in U.S law) to U.S. claims to certain territories on the island including Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Platt_amendment_page_1.jpg/150px-Platt_amendment_page_1.jpg
