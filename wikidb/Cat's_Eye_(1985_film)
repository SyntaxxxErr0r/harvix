7.71	Cat's_Eye_(1985_film)	Cat's Eye (1985 film)	Cat's Eye (also known as Stephen King's Cat's Eye) is a 1985 horror film directed by Lewis Teague and written by Stephen King. It is based on three of King's short stories, "The Ledge", "Quitters, Inc.", and "The General" (the first two appeared in his Night Shift story collection). The three stories are connected only by the presence of a cat traveling long distances to find a young girl in distress. The cat plays an incidental role in the first two and is a major character of the third.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Cat%27s_Eye_%28poster%29.JPG/220px-Cat%27s_Eye_%28poster%29.JPG
