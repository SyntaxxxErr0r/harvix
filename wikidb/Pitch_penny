1.00	Pitch_penny	Pitch penny	Pitch penny (also called Penny seat, Penny slot, Tossing the penny, and Penny in the hole) is a pub game. It involves throwing coins across the room and into a hole carved in the seat of a wooden bench. Another version of the game is played in many western pubs. Contestants stand about 20 feet behind a wall and try to throw the pennies as close to the wall as possible without touching it. Another variation is Toad in the Hole in which a dedicated table or box is used instead of a hole carved in a convenient piece of pub furniture. Toad in the Hole has a World Championship held in Lewes.
