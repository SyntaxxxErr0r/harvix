54.4	Acrylic_paint	Acrylic paint	Acrylic paint is fast drying paint containing pigment suspension in acrylic polymer emulsion. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Pyrrole_Red_Dab.JPG/220px-Pyrrole_Red_Dab.JPG
