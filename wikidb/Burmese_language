47.70	Burmese_language	Burmese language	The Burmese language is the official language of Burma. Burmese is the native language of the Bamar and related sub-ethnic groups of the Bamar, as well as that of some ethnic minorities in Burma like the Mon. Burmese is spoken by 32 million as a first language and as a second language by 10 million, particularly ethnic minorities in Burma and those in neighboring countries. (Although the constitution officially recognizes the English name of the language as the Myanmar language, most English speakers continue to refer to the language as Burmese.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Vendeurs_de_plantes_m%C3%A9dicinales_vers_Kyaiktiyo_Paya.jpg/220px-Vendeurs_de_plantes_m%C3%A9dicinales_vers_Kyaiktiyo_Paya.jpg
