2.10	Weep_hole	Weep hole	Weep holes or "weeper holes" are small openings left in the outer wall of masonry construction as an outlet for water inside a building to move outside the wall and evaporate. The term was coined by archaeologist C. Leonard Woolley after finding evidence of weep holes in ziggurats. Plastic "weeps" are used in modern masonry construction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Open_stootvoeg.jpg/220px-Open_stootvoeg.jpg
