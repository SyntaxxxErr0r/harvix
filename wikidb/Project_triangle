75.3	Project_triangle	Project management triangle	The Project Management Triangle (called also Triple Constraint) is a model of the constraints of project management. It is a graphic aid where the three attributes show on the corners of the triangle to show opposition. It is useful to help with intentionally choosing project biases, or analyzing the goals of your project. It is often used to illustrate that project management success is measured by the project team's ability to manage the project, so that the expected results are produced while managing time and cost.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/The_triad_constraints.jpg/250px-The_triad_constraints.jpg
