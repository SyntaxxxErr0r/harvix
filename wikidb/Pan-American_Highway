66.0	Pan-American_Highway	Pan-American Highway	The Pan-American Highway (Portuguese: , Spanish: or Spanish: ) is a network of roads measuring about 47,958 kilometres (29,800 mi) in total length. Except for an 87 kilometres (54 mi) rainforest break, called the Darién Gap, the road links the mainland nations of the Americas in a connected highway system. According to Guinness World Records, the Pan-American Highway is the world's longest "motorable road". However, because of the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between South America and Central America by traditional motor vehicle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/PanAmericanHwy.png/220px-PanAmericanHwy.png
