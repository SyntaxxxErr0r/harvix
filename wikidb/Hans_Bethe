54.5	Hans_Bethe	Hans Bethe	Hans Albrecht Bethe (German pronunciation: ; July 2, 1906 â€“ March 6, 2005) was a German-American nuclear physicist, and Nobel laureate in physics for his work on the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis. A versatile theoretical physicist, Bethe also made important contributions to quantum electrodynamics, nuclear physics, solid-state physics and astrophysics. During World War II, he was head of the Theoretical Division at the secret Los Alamos laboratory which developed the first atomic bombs. There he played a key role in calculating the critical mass of the weapons, and did theoretical work on the implosion method used in both the Trinity test and the "Fat Man" weapon dropped on Nagasaki, Japan. For most of his career, Bethe was a professor at Cornell University.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Hans_Bethe.jpg/220px-Hans_Bethe.jpg
