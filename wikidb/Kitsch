60.5	Kitsch	Kitsch	Kitsch is a form of art that is considered an inferior, tasteless copy of an extant style of art or a worthless imitation of art of recognized value. The concept is associated with the deliberate use of elements that may be thought of as cultural icons while making cheap mass-produced objects that are unoriginal. Kitsch also refers to the types of art that are aesthetically deficient (whether or not being sentimental, glamorous, theatrical, or creative) and that make creative gestures which merely imitate the superficial appearances of art through repeated conventions and formulae. Excessive sentimentality often is associated with the term.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/The_Widow_%28Boston_Public_Library%29.jpg/220px-The_Widow_%28Boston_Public_Library%29.jpg
