The locomotives were formerly 37100, 37170, 37178 and 37217 respectively. A new inspection shed was built in 2008 at Coleham (Sutton Bridge Junction) in Shrewsbury for these locos.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Talsarnau_railway_station_MMB_07_97303.jpg/220px-Talsarnau_railway_station_MMB_07_97303.jpg
