51.6	Pound_sign	Pound sign	The pound sign (£ or ₤) is the symbol for the pound sterling—the currency of the United Kingdom (UK). The same symbol is (or was) used for similarly named currencies in some other countries and territories, such as the Irish pound, Gibraltar pound, Australian pound, and Italian lira. Several countries, including Lebanon and Egypt, call their currency "the pound" but do not use the £ symbol.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Currency-Symbol_Regions_of_the_World_circa_2006_cropped.png/220px-Currency-Symbol_Regions_of_the_World_circa_2006_cropped.png
