85.7	Disintermediation	Disintermediation	In economics, disintermediation is the removal of intermediaries in a supply chain: "cutting out the middleman". Instead of going through traditional distribution channels, which had some type of intermediate (such as a distributor, wholesaler, broker, or agent), companies may now deal with every customer directly, for example via the Internet. One important factor is a drop in the cost of servicing customers directly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Safewaydeliverytruck.jpg/250px-Safewaydeliverytruck.jpg
