57.1	Aquarium	Aquarium	An aquarium (plural aquariums or aquaria) is a vivarium consisting of at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, marine mammals, turtles, and aquatic plants. The term combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium, meaning "a place for relating to".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Amaterske_akvarium.jpg/220px-Amaterske_akvarium.jpg
