O'Bannon and produced by Jim Henson Productions and Hallmark Entertainment. The Jim Henson Company was largely responsible for the various alien makeup and prosthetics, and two regular characters (the animatronic puppets Rygel and Pilot) are entirely Creature Shop creations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Farscape_Logo.jpg/250px-Farscape_Logo.jpg
