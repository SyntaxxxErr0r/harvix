6.32	2007_North_Lebanon_conflict	2007 Lebanon conflict	The 2007 Lebanon conflict began when fighting broke out between Fatah al-Islam, an Islamist militant organization, and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) on May 20, 2007 in Nahr al-Bared, an UNRWA Palestinian refugee camp near Tripoli. It was the most severe internal fighting since Lebanon's 1975â€“90 civil war. The conflict revolved mostly around the siege of Nahr el-Bared, but minor clashes also occurred in the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp in southern Lebanon and several terrorist bombings took place in and around Lebanon's capital, Beirut. Fighting continued into early September and the LAF declared victory on September 7, 2007.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Nahr_al_Bared_2007.jpg/300px-Nahr_al_Bared_2007.jpg
