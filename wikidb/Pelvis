60.1	Pelvis	Pelvis	The pelvis, derived from the Latin word for 'basin', is an anatomical structure found in most vertebrates. It is the name given to both a bony structure or pelvic girdle connecting the base of the spine to the rear limbs, and the region of the body defined by that structure. The muscles and tissue beneath the pelvic girdle are known as the pelvic floor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Falcarius_pelvis.jpg/220px-Falcarius_pelvis.jpg
