61.6	Attractor	Attractor	An attractor is a set towards which a variable, moving according to the dictates of a dynamical system, evolves over time. That is, points that get close enough to the attractor remain close even if slightly disturbed. The evolving variable may be represented algebraically as an n-dimensional vector. The attractor is a region in n-dimensional space. In physical systems, the n dimensions may be, for example, two or three positional coordinates for each of one or more physical entities; in economic systems, they may be separate variables such as the inflation rate and the unemployment rate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Atractor_Poisson_Saturne.jpg/333px-Atractor_Poisson_Saturne.jpg
