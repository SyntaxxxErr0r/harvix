3.20	Ehrenpokal_der_Luftwaffe	Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe	The design of the Ehrenpokal was based on a World War I aviation award, the Ehrenbecher f√ºr den Sieger im Luftkampfe, or Honor Goblet for the Victor in Air Combat. This award was generally given upon one's first victory in aerial combat (though the actual award bestowal might come some time after the victory). It has been reported (though the late aviation historian Neal O'Connor was unable to confirm before his death) that the requirement for aerial victories may have increased later in the war, since air combat became more common The total number of awards presented is unknown, but it was fewer than its World War II successor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Immelmann_beaker.jpg/220px-Immelmann_beaker.jpg
