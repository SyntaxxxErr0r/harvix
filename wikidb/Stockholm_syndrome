259.6	Stockholm_syndrome	Stockholm syndrome	In psychology, Stockholm Syndrome is an apparently paradoxical psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and have positive feelings towards their captors, sometimes to the point of defending them. These feelings are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims, who essentially mistake a lack of abuse from their captors for an act of kindness. The FBIâ€™s Hostage Barricade Database System shows that roughly 27% of victims show evidence of Stockholm Syndrome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Former_Kreditbanken_Norrmalmstorg_Stockholm_Sweden.jpg/250px-Former_Kreditbanken_Norrmalmstorg_Stockholm_Sweden.jpg
