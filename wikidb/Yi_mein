15.21	Yi_mein	Yi mein	Yi mein (also called e-fu noodles, yee-fu noodles, yi noodles, or yifu noodles) is a variety of flat Cantonese egg noodles made from wheat flour. They are known for their golden yellow color and chewy characteristics. The slightly chewy and slightly spongy texture of the noodles is due to the soda water used in making the dough (as opposed to regular non-carbonated water).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Plain_Yi_mein.jpg/250px-Plain_Yi_mein.jpg
