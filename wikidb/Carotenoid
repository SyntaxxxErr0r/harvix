69.4	Carotenoid	Carotenoid	Carotenoids are tetraterpenoid organic pigments that are naturally occurring in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants and some other photosynthetic organisms like algae, some bacteria, and some types of fungus. Carotenoids can be synthesized fats and other basic organic metabolic building blocks by all these organisms. Carotenoids generally cannot be manufactured by species in the animal kingdom (although one species of aphid is known to have acquired the genes for synthesis of the carotenoid torulene from fungi by horizontal gene transfer). Animals obtain carotenoids in their diets, and may employ them in various ways in metabolism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Grand_prismatic_spring.jpg/300px-Grand_prismatic_spring.jpg
