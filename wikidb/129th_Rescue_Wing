3.10	129th_Rescue_Wing	129th Rescue Wing	The 129th Rescue Wing (129 RQW) is an Air National Guard combat search and rescue (CSAR) unit operationally gained by the Air Combat Command (ACC). The unit's history dates to April 1955, when it was activated as the 129th Air Resupply Group of the California Air National Guard. In 1975, the 129th transitioned to a new mission, air rescue, and was operationally gained within the U.S. Air Force by the then-Tactical Air Command (TAC). The 129th moved to Naval Air Station Moffett Field (now Moffett Federal Airfield), its current location, in May 1980. In 1992, the unit received its current designation as the "129th Rescue Wing." By the end of August 2009, it had 786 saves including the longest air-sea rescue, first combat save of ANG rescue service, over 200 combat saves, and more than 530 civilian saves. The 129th "starred" in The Perfect Storm supplying aircraft and aircrew in support of the film's production. The film includes the story of exceptional rescues by the New York Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/129th_Rescue_Wing.png/200px-129th_Rescue_Wing.png
