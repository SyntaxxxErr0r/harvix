67.6	Trombone	Trombone	The trombone (Ger. Posaune, Sp. trombón) is a musical instrument in the brass family. Like all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player’s vibrating lips cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism by which the length of the instrument can be varied to change the pitch. Instead of a slide, the valve trombone has three valves like those on a trumpet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Tenor_slide_trombone_3D_model.jpg/250px-Tenor_slide_trombone_3D_model.jpg
