12.32	Ed_Koch_Queensboro_Bridge	Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge	The Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, also known as the 59th Street Bridge – because its Manhattan end is located between 59th and 60th Streets – or simply the Queensboro Bridge, is a cantilever bridge over the East River in New York City that was completed in 1909. It connects the neighborhood of Long Island City in the borough of Queens with Manhattan, passing over Roosevelt Island. It carries New York State Route 25 and is the westernmost of the four East River spans that carry a route number: NY 25 terminates at the west (Manhattan) side of the bridge, which once carried NY 24 and NY 25A as well. The bridge is flanked on its northern side by the freestanding Roosevelt Island Tramway.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Queensboro_Bridge_From_Roosevelt_Island_Night_crop.jpg/250px-Queensboro_Bridge_From_Roosevelt_Island_Night_crop.jpg
