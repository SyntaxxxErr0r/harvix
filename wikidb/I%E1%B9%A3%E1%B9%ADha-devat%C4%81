1.00	I%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADha-devat%C4%81	Iṣṭha-deva(tā) (Buddhism)	In Vajrayana Buddhism, an Ishta-deva or Ishta-devata is a fully enlightened being who is the focus of personal meditation, during a retreat or for life. The term is often translated into English as tutelary deity, meditation deity, or meditational deity. The Ishta-deva appears in the 'Inner' refuge formula of the Three Roots and is also the key element of Deity Yoga since the 'deity' in the yoga is the Ishta-deva.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/100px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png
