1.10	Sprigging	Sprigging	Sprigging is a method of plant propagation whereby cuttings of stolons or rhizomes are planted instead of seed onto the soil surface or into furrows or small holes. This method is common for establishing Cynodon (Bermuda Grass) and Zoysia (Zoysiagrass). The stolons/rhizomes can also be broadcast in a slurry as in hydroseeding.
