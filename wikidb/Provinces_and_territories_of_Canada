53.0	Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada	Provinces and territories of Canada	The provinces and territories of Canada combine to make up the world's second-largest country by area. There are ten provinces and three territories. The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces are jurisdictions that receive their power and authority directly from the Constitution Act, 1867, whereas territories derive their mandates and powers from the federal government. In modern Canadian constitutional theory, the provinces are considered to be co-sovereign divisions, and each province has its own "Crown" represented by the lieutenant-governor, whereas the territories are not sovereign, but simply parts of the federal realm, and have a commissioner.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Stained_glass%2C_Oh_Canada_Royal_Military_College_of_Canada_Club_Montreal_1965.jpg/250px-Stained_glass%2C_Oh_Canada_Royal_Military_College_of_Canada_Club_Montreal_1965.jpg
