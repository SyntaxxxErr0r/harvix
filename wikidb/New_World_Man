2.10	New_World_Man	New World Man	"New World Man" is a track from the 1982 album Signals by Canadian rock band Rush. The song was the last and quickest composed song on the album, stemming from a suggestion by then-Rush producer Terry Brown to even out the lengths of the two sides of the cassette version. It went to #1 (on the RPM national singles chart) in Canada, where it remained for two weeks in October 1982. Less successful in the U.S., it nonetheless remains Rush's only American Top 40 hit, peaking at #21 on the Billboard singles chart for three weeks in October and November 1982. It also topped the Billboard Top Tracks chart for two weeks (their first single to do so). "New World Man" also reached #42 in the UK; a remixed version released as a double A-side with "Countdown" later reached #36 in the UK in early 1983.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/New_World_Man_single.jpg/220px-New_World_Man_single.jpg
