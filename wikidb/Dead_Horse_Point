1.01	Dead_Horse_Point	Dead Horse Point State Park	Dead Horse Point State Park is a state park of Utah, USA, featuring a dramatic overlook of the Colorado River and Canyonlands National Park. The park is so named because of its use as a natural corral by cowboys in the 19th century. The "dead horse" part of the name is that the corral was abandoned, but the horses did not leave the corral, even after the gate was left open, and died there. The park covers 5,362 acres (21.70 km2) of high desert at an altitude of 5,900 feet (1,800 m). [Per Marcia Cooper, Coordinator for the Elderhostel Program "Utah's Parks and Monuments," and former resident of Moab, Dead Horse Point was named by early Mormon pioneers for a rock formation at the base of the plateau. It is clearly visible and looks like a dead white horse lying on its side - see "Dead Horse Point name source" image below. Marcia says the horse corral/abandonment story was made up by a Moab elementary school student who participated in a chamber-of-commerce type contest early in the twentieth century to come up with a story to lure visitors to the site. The ruse continues to this day as reflected in state park literature, and this Wikipedia article.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Dead_Horse_Point2.jpg/256px-Dead_Horse_Point2.jpg
