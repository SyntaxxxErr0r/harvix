59.1	Synthetic_aperture_radar	Synthetic aperture radar	Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) is a form of radar whose defining characteristic is its use of relative motion, between an antenna and its target region, to provide distinctive long-term coherent-signal variations, that are exploited to obtain finer spatial resolution than is possible with conventional beam-scanning means. It originated as an advanced form of side-looking airborne radar (SLAR).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Venus_globe.jpg/220px-Venus_globe.jpg
