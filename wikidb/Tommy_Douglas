53.8	Tommy_Douglas	Tommy Douglas	Thomas Clement "Tommy" Douglas, (20 October 1904 â€“ 24 February 1986) was a Scottish-born Baptist minister who became a prominent Canadian social democratic politician. As leader of the Saskatchewan Section of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) from 1942 and the seventh Premier of Saskatchewan from 1944 to 1961, he led the first social democratic government in North America which introduced single payer, universal health care to Canada. When the CCF united with the Canadian Labour Congress to form the New Democratic Party, Douglas was elected as its first federal leader and served in that post from 1961 to 1971. In a CBC survey on who they considered the greatest Canadian, Canadians voted Douglas first largely in support of his advocacy of universal health care in Canada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Tommycropped.jpg/220px-Tommycropped.jpg
