309.4	Ada_Lovelace	Ada Lovelace	Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852), born Augusta Ada Byron, was an English writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the analytical engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine; thanks to this, she is sometimes considered the "World's First Computer Programmer".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Ada_lovelace.jpg/225px-Ada_lovelace.jpg
