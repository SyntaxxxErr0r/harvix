60.7	Fritz_Leiber	Fritz Leiber	Fritz Reuter Leiber, Jr. (December 24, 1910 â€“ September 5, 1992) was an American writer (of German extraction) of fantasy, horror and science fiction. He was also a poet, actor in theatre and films, playwright, expert chess player and a champion fencer. Possibly his greatest chess accomplishment was winning clear first in the 1958 Santa Monica Open. With writers such as Robert E. Howard and Michael Moorcock, Leiber can be regarded as one of the fathers of Sword and Sorcery fantasy. But he excelled in all fields of speculative fiction, writing award-winning work in horror, fantasy and science fiction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fa/FSF_0769.jpg/220px-FSF_0769.jpg
