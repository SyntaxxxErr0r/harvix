91.7	Amethyst	Amethyst	Amethyst is a violet variety of quartz often used in jewelry. The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἀ a- ("not") and μέθυστος methustos ("intoxicated"), a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness. The ancient Greeks and Romans wore amethyst and made drinking vessels of it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication. It is one of several forms of quartz. Amethyst is the traditional birthstone for February.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Amethyst._Magaliesburg%2C_South_Africa.jpg/300px-Amethyst._Magaliesburg%2C_South_Africa.jpg
