Despite being Lee's only published book, it led to Lee being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom of the United States for her contribution to literature in 2007. Lee has also been the recipient of numerous honorary degrees, but has always declined to make a speech.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Harper_Lee_Medal.jpg/250px-Harper_Lee_Medal.jpg
