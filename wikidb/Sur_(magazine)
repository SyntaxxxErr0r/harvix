8.31	Sur_(magazine)	Sur (magazine)	Sur was a literary literary magazine published in Buenos Aires. Its main backer was Victoria Ocampo, and it was supported intellectually by the Spanish philosopher Jos√© Ortega y Gasset. Many of the earliest editions of Sur carry the colophon of Ortega's Revista de Occidente. Notable contributors and sometime editors include Jorge Luis Borges, Adolfo Bioy Casares and Borges' Spanish brother-in-law Guillermo de Torre. The journal was first published in 1931, with the assistance of a multidisciplinary team of collaborators, among them Victoria's old friend and translator Pelegrina Pastorino, though declining readership led to its irregular publication after 1966. The last copy was published in 1992.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Victoria_Ocampo_y_Sur.jpg/190px-Victoria_Ocampo_y_Sur.jpg
