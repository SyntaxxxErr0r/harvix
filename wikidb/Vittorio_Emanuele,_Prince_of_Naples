He is commonly known in Italy as Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia. Although the titles and distinctions of the Italian royal family have not been legally recognised in Italy since 1946, he is often styled Prince of Naples out of courtesy, particularly by supporters of the former monarchy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Great_coat_of_arms_of_the_king_of_italy_%281890-1946%29.svg/120px-Great_coat_of_arms_of_the_king_of_italy_%281890-1946%29.svg.png
