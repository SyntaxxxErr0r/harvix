2.01	Mile_(Scots)	Mile	A mile is a unit of length, most commonly 5,280 feet (1,760 yards, or about 1,609 metres). The mile of 5,280 feet is sometimes called the statute mile or land mile to distinguish it from the nautical mile (1,852 metres, about 6,076.1 feet). There have also been many historical miles and similar units in other systems that may be translated into English as miles; they have varied in length from 1 to 15 kilometres.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ce/A87-bilingual.jpg/220px-A87-bilingual.jpg
