70.5	Pineal_gland	Pineal gland	The pineal gland (also called the pineal body, epiphysis cerebri, epiphysis, conarium or the "third eye") is a small endocrine gland in the vertebrate brain. It produces the serotonin derivative melatonin, a hormone that affects the modulation of wake/sleep patterns and seasonal functions. Its shape resembles a tiny pine cone (hence its name), and it is located near the centre of the brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two rounded thalamic bodies join.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Illu_pituitary_pineal_glands.jpg/250px-Illu_pituitary_pineal_glands.jpg
