57.2	Postage_stamp	Postage stamp	A postage stamp is a small piece of paper that is purchased and displayed on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage. Typically, stamps are made from special paper, with a national designation and denomination (price) on the face, and a gum adhesive on the reverse side. Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration or other authorized vendor and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Nicaragua1_1913.jpg/220px-Nicaragua1_1913.jpg
