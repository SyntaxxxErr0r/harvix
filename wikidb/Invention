65.9	Invention	Invention	An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition, process or discovery. It may also be an improvement upon a machine or product, or alternate means of achieving a process. An invention that is not derived from an existing model or idea, or that achieves a completely unique function, discovery, or result, may be a radical breakthrough. In addition, there is cultural invention, which is an innovative set of useful social behaviors adopted by people and passed on to others. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability. An invention that is novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field may be able to obtain the legal protection of a patent.
