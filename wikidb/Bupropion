58.6	Bupropion	Bupropion	Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant and smoking cessation aid. Its chemical name is β-Keto-3-chloro-N-tert-butylamphetamine, a substituted cathinone (β-Ketoamphetamine), both of which are chemical derivatives of substituted amphetamine. The drug therefore is a mild psychostimulant. Its primary pharmacological action is thought to be norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibition. It binds selectively to the dopamine transporter, but its behavioural effects have often been attributed to its inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake. It also acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Bupropion belongs to the chemical class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants cathinone and diethylpropion, and to phenethylamines in general. Medically, bupropion serves as a non-tricyclic antidepressant fundamentally different to most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as SSRIs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Bupropion_skeletal.svg/200px-Bupropion_skeletal.svg.png
