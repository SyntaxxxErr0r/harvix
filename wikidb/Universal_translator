68.8	Universal_translator	Universal translator	A universal translator is a device common to many science fiction works, especially on television. First described in Murray Leinster's 1945 novella "First Contact", the translator's purpose is to offer an instant translation of any language. Like hyperdrive, a universal translator depicted in these works is a somewhat improbable technology that is an accepted convention in science fiction stories and serves as a useful plot device. Even so, technology companies are striving to develop a practical "universal" translator for common use.
