56.0	Diversification_(finance)	Diversification (finance)	In finance, diversification means reducing risk by investing in a variety of assets. If the asset values do not move up and down in perfect synchrony, a diversified portfolio will have less risk than the weighted average risk of its constituent assets, and often less risk than the least risky of its constituents. Therefore, any risk-averse investor will diversify to at least some extent, with more risk-averse investors diversifying more completely than less risk-averse investors.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Asset_allocation.gif/230px-Asset_allocation.gif
