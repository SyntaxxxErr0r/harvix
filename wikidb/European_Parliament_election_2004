2.20	European_Parliament_election_2004	European Parliament election, 2004	Elections to the European Parliament were held from 10 June 2004 to 13 June 2004 in the 25 member states of the European Union, using varying election days according to local custom. Votes were counted as the polls closed, but results were not announced until 13 and 14 June so results from one country would not influence voters in another where polls were still open; however, the Netherlands, voting on Thursday 10, announced nearly-complete provisional results as soon as they were counted, on the evening of its election day, a move heavily criticized by the European Commission.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/2004_EP_election_result_by_Member_State.svg/400px-2004_EP_election_result_by_Member_State.svg.png
