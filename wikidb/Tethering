113.8	Tethering	Tethering	Tethering means sharing the Internet connection of an Internet-capable mobile phone or internet tablet with other devices. This sharing can be offered over a wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), over Bluetooth, or by physical connection using a cable. In the case of tethering over wireless LAN, the feature may be branded as a mobile hotspot. The Internet-connected mobile phone acts as a portable router when providing tethering services to others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Tethering.jpg/230px-Tethering.jpg
