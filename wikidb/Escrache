6.20	Escrache	Escrache	Escrache is the name given in Uruguay and Argentina to a type of demonstration in which a group of activists go to the home or place of work of someone they wish to denounce. The demonstrators' aim is to make their claims publicly known, but the escrache is also occasionally used as a form of intimidation and public accusation. Argentina's laws granted immunity to many of those responsible for disappearances, torture, and other crimes during the Guerra Sucia, and the criminals live anonymously in retirement. The escrache aims to make their identities public, so that they can't hide their past from those around them. In Chile this is called a "Funa" and denounces mostly criminal acts from specific personalities under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.
