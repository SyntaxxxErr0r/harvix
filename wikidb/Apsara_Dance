10.23	Apsara_Dance	Robam Tep Apsara	Robam Tep Apsara (, lit., Dance of the Apsara Divinities) is the title of a Khmer classical dance created by the Royal Ballet of Cambodia in the mid-20th century under the patronage of Queen Sisowath Kossomak. The apsara is played by a woman, sewn into tight-fitting traditional dress, whose graceful, sinuous gestures are codified to narrate classical myths or religious stories.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Apsara_Dancer_Smile_of_Angkor_Theatre.jpg/220px-Apsara_Dancer_Smile_of_Angkor_Theatre.jpg
