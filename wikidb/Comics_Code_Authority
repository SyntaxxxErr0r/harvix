98.0	Comics_Code_Authority	Comics Code Authority	The Comics Code Authority was a body created as part of the Comics Magazine Association of America, as a tool for the comics-publishing industry to self-regulate the content of comic books in the United States. Member publishers submitted comic books to the CCA, which screened them for adherence to its Comics Code, and authorized the use of their seal on the cover if the books complied. At the height of its influence, it was a de facto censor for the U.S. comic book industry. The last publishers discontinued their participation in 2011.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cf/Approved_by_the_Comics_Code_Authority.gif
