66.7	Lapsang_souchong	Lapsang souchong	Lapsang souchong originally from the Wuyi region of the Chinese province of Fujian. It is sometimes referred to as smoked tea (熏茶). Lapsang is distinct from all other types of tea because lapsang leaves are traditionally smoke-dried over pinewood fires, taking on a distinctive smoky flavour.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/JacksonsLapsangSouchong_low.jpg/215px-JacksonsLapsangSouchong_low.jpg
