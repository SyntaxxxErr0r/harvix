Scrooge is an elderly Scottish anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a red or blue frock coat, top hat, pince-nez glasses, and spats and is portrayed in animations as speaking with a slight Scottish accent, also sometimes known as a Scottish burr. His dominant character trait is his thrift, and within the context of the fictional Disney universe, he is the Earth's richest person.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/BarksScrooge.jpg/250px-BarksScrooge.jpg
