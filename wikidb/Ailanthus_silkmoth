2.02	Ailanthus_silkmoth	Samia cynthia	The Ailanthus silkmoth is a saturniid moth, used to produce silk fabric but not as domesticated as the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The moth has very large wings of 113-125 mm, with a quarter-moon shaped spot on both the upper and lower wings, whitish and yellow stripes and brown background. There are "eyespots" on the outer fore wings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Samia_cynthia_adult_male_sjh.JPG/250px-Samia_cynthia_adult_male_sjh.JPG
