51.4	Gary_Gilmore	Gary Gilmore	Gary Mark Gilmore (December 4, 1940 â€“ January 17, 1977) was an American criminal, murderer, who gained international notoriety for demanding that his own death sentence be fulfilled following two murders he committed in Utah. He became the first person executed in the United States after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a new series of death penalty statutes in the 1976 decision Gregg v. Georgia (these new statutes avoiding the problems that had led earlier death penalty statutes to be deemed unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia). Gilmore was executed by firing squad in 1977.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/Gary_Gilmore_mugshot.jpg/224px-Gary_Gilmore_mugshot.jpg
