140.2	Airbus_A380	Airbus A380	The Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by the European corporation Airbus, a subsidiary of EADS. It is the world's largest passenger airliner and due to its size, many airports have had to expand their facilities to properly accommodate it. Designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly in the large-aircraft market, the A380 made its maiden flight on 27 April 2005 and entered initial commercial service in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines. The aircraft was known as the Airbus A3XX during much of its development, before receiving the A380 designation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/A380_Emirates_A6-EDC.jpg/300px-A380_Emirates_A6-EDC.jpg
