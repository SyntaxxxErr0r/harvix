147.4	Xenu	Xenu	Xenu ( -noo), also spelled Xemu, was, according to the founder of Scientology L. Ron Hubbard, the dictator of the "Galactic Confederacy" who, 75 million years ago, brought billions of his people to Earth in a DC-8-like spacecraft, stacked them around volcanoes and killed them using hydrogen bombs. Official Scientology scriptures hold that the essences of these many people remained, and that they form around people in modern times, causing them spiritual harm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/DC-8_72_overflight.jpg/200px-DC-8_72_overflight.jpg
