1.00	Lambda_Award	Lambda Literary Award	Lambda Literary Awards (also known as the "Lammys") are awarded yearly by the US-based Lambda Literary Foundation to published works which celebrate or explore LGBT themes. Categories include Humor, Romance and Biography. To qualify, a book must have been published in the United States in the year current to the award. The Lambda Literary Foundation states that its mission is "to celebrate LGBT literature and provide resources for writers, readers, booksellers, publishers, and librarians - the whole literary community." The awards were instituted in 1988.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Lambda_award_2008.jpg/220px-Lambda_award_2008.jpg
