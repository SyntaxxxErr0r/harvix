110.1	Mythology	Mythology	The term mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. As examples, comparative mythology is the study of connections between myths from different cultures, whereas Greek mythology is the body of myths from ancient Greece. In the field of folkloristics, a myth is defined as a sacred narrative explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form. Many scholars in other fields use the term "myth" in somewhat different ways. In a very broad sense, the word can refer to any story originating within traditions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Gustave_Moreau_006.jpg/220px-Gustave_Moreau_006.jpg
