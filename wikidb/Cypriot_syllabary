8.62	Cypriot_syllabary	Cypriot syllabary	The Cypriot syllabary is a syllabic script used in Iron Age Cyprus, from ca. the 11th to the 4th centuries BCE, when it was replaced by the Greek alphabet. A pioneer of that change was king Evagoras of Salamis. It is descended from the Cypro-Minoan syllabary, in turn a variant or derivative of Linear A.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Cypriot_syllabic_inscription_600-500BC.jpg/310px-Cypriot_syllabic_inscription_600-500BC.jpg
