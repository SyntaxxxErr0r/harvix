In some countries it is made with mango or banana instead of avocado. Sometimes crab salad is substituted for the crab stick, and often the outer layer of rice (in an inside-out roll) is sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, tobiko or masago.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/California_roll_with_tobiko.jpg/250px-California_roll_with_tobiko.jpg
