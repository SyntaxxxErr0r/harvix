1.00	Pygmy_right_whale	Pygmy right whale	The pygmy right whale is a baleen whale, the sole member of the family Neobalaenidae. First described by John Edward Gray in 1846, it is the smallest of the baleen whales, ranging between 6 metres (20 ft) and 6.5 metres (21 ft) in length and 3,000 and 3,500 kg in mass. Despite its name, the pygmy right whale may have more in common with the gray whale and rorquals than the bowhead and right whales.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Caperea_marginata_3.jpg/220px-Caperea_marginata_3.jpg
