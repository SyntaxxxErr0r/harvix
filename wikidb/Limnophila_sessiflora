1.00	Limnophila_sessiflora	Limnophila sessiliflora	Looks superficially rather similar to Cabomba but it has leaves in proper whorls, about 1.2 inches (3cm) in diameter. The leaves are pinnate and bright green in colour. Under strong light the leaves take on a reddish hue. Can reach over 16 inches (40cm) in height. The submerse leaves are very different from the emerse forms - dark green, more or less lance-shaped.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Limnophila_sessiliflora.jpg/220px-Limnophila_sessiliflora.jpg
