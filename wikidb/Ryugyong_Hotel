75.7	Ryugyong_Hotel	Ryugyong Hotel	The Ryugyong Hotel is a 105-story skyscraper under construction in Pyongyang, North Korea. Its name ("capital of willows") is also one of the historic names for Pyongyang. The building is also known as the 105 Building, a reference to its number of floors. Construction began in 1987 with planned completion in 1989. However, after several delays, construction was eventually halted in 1992; the fall of the Soviet Union had resulted in widespread economic disruptions in North Korea and shortages of raw materials.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Ryugyeong_Hotel_on_February_2011.jpg/250px-Ryugyeong_Hotel_on_February_2011.jpg
