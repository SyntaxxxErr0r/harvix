64.10	Dark_Side_of_the_Rainbow	Dark Side of the Rainbow	Dark Side of the Rainbow – also known as Dark Side of Oz or The Wizard of Floyd – refers to the pairing of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon with the visual portion of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. This produces moments where the film and the album appear to correspond with each other. The title of the music video-like experience comes from a combination of the album title and the film's song "Over the Rainbow". Band members and others involved in the making of the album state that any relationship between the two works of art is merely a coincidence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Dark_Side_of_the_Rainbow.jpg/225px-Dark_Side_of_the_Rainbow.jpg
