55.5	Zeolite	Zeolite	Zeolites are microporous, aluminosilicate minerals commonly used as commercial adsorbents. The term zeolite was originally coined in 1756 by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who observed that upon rapidly heating the material stilbite, it produced large amounts of steam from water that had been adsorbed by the material. Based on this, he called the material zeolite, from the Greek , meaning "to boil" and (l√≠thos), meaning "stone".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/ZeolitesUSGOV.jpg/220px-ZeolitesUSGOV.jpg
