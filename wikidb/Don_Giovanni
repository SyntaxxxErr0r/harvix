84.7	Don_Giovanni	Don Giovanni	Don Giovanni is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and with an Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the Teatro di Praga (now called the Estates Theatre) on October 29, 1787. Da Ponte's libretto was billed like many of its time as dramma giocoso, a term that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action. Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an "opera buffa". Although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Croce-Mozart-Detail.jpg/220px-Croce-Mozart-Detail.jpg
