7.23	Andr%C3%A9s_de_Urdaneta	Andrés de Urdaneta	Friar Andrés de Urdaneta, O.S.A., was a Spanish circumnavigator, explorer and Augustinian friar. As a navigator he achieved in 1536 the "second" world circumnavigation after first one led by Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano in 1522. Urdaneta discovered and plotted a path across the Pacific from the Philippines to Acapulco in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (present day Mexico) used by the Manila galleons, which came to be known as "Urdaneta's route."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Andres_de_Urdaneta.jpg
