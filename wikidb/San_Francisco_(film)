The Internet Movie Database reports that famous silent film directors D. W. Griffith and Erich von Stroheim contributed to the screenplay without screen credit. Griffith also helped direct the famous earthquake sequence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/San_Francisco_%28film%29_poster.jpg/220px-San_Francisco_%28film%29_poster.jpg
