61.5	Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c	Thich Quang Duc	Thích Quảng Đức , was a Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist monk who burned himself to death at a busy Saigon road intersection on 11 June 1963. Đức was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by South Vietnam's Roman Catholic government led by Ngô Đình Diệm. Photos of his self-immolation were circulated widely across the world and brought attention to the policies of the Diệm regime. Malcolm Browne won a Pulitzer Prize for his renowned photograph of the monk's death. After his death, his body was re-cremated, but his heart remained intact. This was interpreted as a symbol of compassion and led Buddhists to revere him as a bodhisattva, heightening the impact of his death on the public psyche.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/Memorial_to_Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_during_daytime.jpg/220px-Memorial_to_Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_during_daytime.jpg
