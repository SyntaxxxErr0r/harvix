51.9	Gnome	Gnome	A gnome is a diminutive spirit in Renaissance magic and alchemy, first introduced by Paracelsus and later adopted by more recent authors including those of modern fantasy literature. Its characteristics have been reinterpreted to suit the needs of various story-tellers, but it is typically said to be a small, humanoid creature that lives underground.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Gnome_030209_story13.jpg/220px-Gnome_030209_story13.jpg
