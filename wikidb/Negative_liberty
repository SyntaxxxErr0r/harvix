55.1	Negative_liberty	Negative liberty	Negative liberty is defined as freedom from interference by other people, and is set in contrast to positive liberty, which is defined as an individual's freedom from inhibitions of the social structure within the society such as classism, sexism or racism and is primarily concerned with the possession of sociological agency. According to Thomas Hobbes, "a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do" (Leviathan, Ch. XXI, , thus alluding to liberty in its negative sense).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Mammon.jpg/120px-Mammon.jpg
