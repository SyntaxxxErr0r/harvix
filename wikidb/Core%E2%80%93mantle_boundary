3.13	Core%E2%80%93mantle_boundary	Core–mantle boundary	The core–mantle boundary (CMB in the parlance of solid earth geophysicists) lies between the Earth's silicate mantle and its liquid iron-nickel outer core. This boundary is located at approximately 2900 km (1798 mi) depth beneath the Earth's surface. The boundary is observed via the discontinuity in seismic wave velocities at that depth. This discontinuity is due to the differences between the acoustic impedances of the solid mantle and the molten outer core. P-wave velocities are much slower in the outer core than in the deep mantle while S-waves do not exist at all in the liquid portion of the core. Recent evidence suggests a distinct boundary layer directly atop the CMB possibly made of a novel phase of the basic perovskite mineralogy of the deep mantle named post-perovskite. Seismic tomography studies have shown significant irregularities within the boundary zone and are suggestive of a possible organized structure as well as the presence of deep mantle plumes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Slice_earth.svg/220px-Slice_earth.svg.png
