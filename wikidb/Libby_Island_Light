It was first established in 1817 as a wood tower. The present granite structure was built in 1823 and improved in 1848. Alexander Parris was involved in the 1848 work. It is unpainted in the historic photo, but was painted white at some point. The USCG removed the paint in 2007.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Libby_Island_Light_ME.JPG/220px-Libby_Island_Light_ME.JPG
