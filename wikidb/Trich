1.00	Trich	Trichomoniasis	Trichomoniasis, sometimes referred to as "trich", is a common cause of vaginitis. It is a sexually transmitted disease, and is caused by the single-celled protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis producing mechanical stress on host cells and then ingesting cell fragments after cell death. Trichomoniasis is primarily an infection of the urogenital tract; the most common site of infection is the urethra and the vagina in women.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Trichomonas_pap_test.jpg/230px-Trichomonas_pap_test.jpg
