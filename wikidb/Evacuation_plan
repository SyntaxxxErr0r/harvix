2.00	Evacuation_plan	Emergency evacuation	Emergency evacuation is the immediate and rapid movement of people away from the threat or actual occurrence of a hazard. Examples range from the small scale evacuation of a building due to a bomb threat or fire to the large scale evacuation of a district because of a flood, bombardment or approaching weather system. In situations involving hazardous materials or possible contamination, evacuees may be decontaminated prior to being transported out of the contaminated area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Rita_evacuees_from_Houston_Texas_September_21_2005.jpg/250px-Rita_evacuees_from_Houston_Texas_September_21_2005.jpg
