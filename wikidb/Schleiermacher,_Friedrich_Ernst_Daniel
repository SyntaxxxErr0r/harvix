3.00	Schleiermacher,_Friedrich_Ernst_Daniel	Friedrich Schleiermacher	Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (German pronunciation: ) (November 21, 1768 â€“ February 12, 1834) was a German theologian and philosopher known for his attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the Enlightenment with traditional Protestant orthodoxy. He also became influential in the evolution of Higher Criticism, and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of hermeneutics. Because of his profound impact on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the "Father of Modern Liberal Theology." The Neo-Orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Friedrich_Daniel_Ernst_Schleiermacher.jpg/220px-Friedrich_Daniel_Ernst_Schleiermacher.jpg
