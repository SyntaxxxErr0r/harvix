3.20	H%C3%A9ctor_Buitrago	Héctor Buitrago	Hector Buitrago is the co-member of the multiple Grammy winning Colombian Latin alternative band Aterciopelados. Buitrago came from a hardcore rock background, heading a group called La Pestilencia, while co-member Andrea Echeverri had been drawn into the fledgling scene through art school friends. Hector and Andrea went on to open one of Bogota’s only rock clubs, and their relationship is one Latin rock’s most successful artistic partnerships.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Aterciopelados_-_Bumbershoot_2010_-_04.jpg/220px-Aterciopelados_-_Bumbershoot_2010_-_04.jpg
