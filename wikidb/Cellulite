73.2	Cellulite	Cellulite	Cellulite is a topographic skin change that occurs in most postpubertal females. It presents as a modification of skin topography evident by skin dimpling and nodularity that occurs mainly in women on the pelvic region, lower limbs, and abdomen, and is caused by the herniation of subcutaneous fat within fibrous connective tissue, leading to a padded or orange peelâ€“like appearance. Cellulite is a description rather than a physical object. The term was first used in the 1920s, and began appearing in English language publications in the late 1960s, with the earliest reference in Vogue magazine, "Like a swift migrating fish, the word cellulite has suddenly crossed the Atlantic." Its existence as a real disorder has been questioned, and the prevailing medical opinion is that it is merely the "normal condition of many women". One cosmetic company has noted its historical place in industrialised societies as an "inappropriate term used by women to describe curves which they judge to be too plump and not very aesthetic".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Dimples_of_Venus.jpg/257px-Dimples_of_Venus.jpg
