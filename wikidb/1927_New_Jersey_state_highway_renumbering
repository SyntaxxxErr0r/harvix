The old system, which had been defined in sequence by the legislature, was growing badly, as several routes shared the same number, and many unnumbered state highways had been defined. A partial renumbering was proposed in 1926, getting rid of the duplicates and assigning numbers to many of the unnumbered routes, but instead a total renumbering was done in 1927.
