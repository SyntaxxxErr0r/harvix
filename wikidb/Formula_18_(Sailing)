4.11	Formula_18_(Sailing)	Formula 18 (Sailing)	The Formula 18 class, with its F18 abbreviation, is one of the success stories in the sport catamaran scene. It was started in the early 1990s and quickly grew to a full-sized International Sailing Federation recognised class with big racing fleets all over the globe. Before the turn of the century, the F18 class was attracting up to 150 boats and crews to their world championships. Since then a limit has been placed on attendance (max 150) and therefore qualifier rounds are held in several areas to decide who may go to the world championships and who may not.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/3_f18_downwind.JPG/400px-3_f18_downwind.JPG
