102.0	World_energy_resources_and_consumption	World energy consumption	World energy consumption in 2010: over 5% growth Energy markets have combined crisis recovery and strong industry dynamism. Energy consumption in the G20 soared by more than 5% in 2010, after the slight decrease of 2009. This strong increase is the result of two converging trends. On the one-hand, industrialized countries, which experienced sharp decreases in energy demand in 2009, recovered firmly in 2010, almost coming back to historical trends. Oil, gas, coal, and electricity markets followed the same trend. On the other hand, China and India, which showed no signs of slowing down in 2009, continued their intense demand for all forms of energy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/World_Energy_consumption.png/250px-World_Energy_consumption.png
