102.5	Binaural_recording	Binaural recording	Binaural recording is a method of recording sound that uses two microphones, arranged with the intent to create a 3-D stereo sound sensation for the listener of actually being in the room with the performers or instruments. This effect is often created using a technique known as "Dummy head recording", wherein a mannequin head is outfitted with a microphone in each ear. Binaural recording is intended for replay using headphones and will not translate properly over stereo speakers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Dummyhead.jpg/220px-Dummyhead.jpg
