2.00	See_of_Sardis	See of Sardis	The See of Sardis (or Sardes, Italian Sardi) was an episcopal see in Sardis. It was one of the Seven Churches of the Apocalypse, held by metropolitan bishops since the middle to late 1st century, with jurisdiction over the province of Lydia (formed in 295). Since 1369 it was intermittently occupied by both Eastern Orthodox metropolitan bishops (until 1986) and Roman Catholic archbishops consecrated in partibus infidelium and later titular archbishops (until 1976).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Map_of_Lydia_ancient_times.jpg/220px-Map_of_Lydia_ancient_times.jpg
