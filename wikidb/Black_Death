250.9	Black_Death	Black Death	The Black Death was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, peaking in Europe between 1348 and 1350. Although there were several competing theories as to the etiology of the Black Death, it has been conclusively proven via analysis of ancient DNA from plague victims in northern and southern Europe that the pathogen responsible is the Yersinia pestis bacterium. Thought to have started in China, it travelled along the Silk Road and reached the Crimea by 1346.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Smallpox01.jpg/300px-Smallpox01.jpg
