1.00	Keys_to_the_White_House	The Keys to the White House	The Keys to the White House is a 1996 book about a historically based prediction system for determining the next President of the United States. The system was developed by American historian Allan Lichtman and Russian scientist Vladimir Keilis-Borok, an authority on the mathematics of prediction models. The model has a record of accurate forecasts but has been criticised by some statisticians as including too many predictors to be a sound model and for forecasting only the winner of elections rather than the vote share of the winning party.
