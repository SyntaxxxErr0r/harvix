The film, directed by Rob Reiner, was released on Christmas, 2007. The film tells the story of two men (Nicholson and Freeman) who are roommates in a cancer ward where they learn on the same day that they each have only months to live. When Freeman's character was nineteen, he wrote a list of all the things he wanted to do with his life before he "kicked the bucket." Nicholson plays a millionaire who adds his own wishes to Morgan's list and the two men are soon skydiving, driving vintage race cars and riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle along the Great Wall of China.
