2.00	Baeksuk	Baeksuk	Baeksuk (literally "white cooking") is a Korean culinary term referring to dishes made by boiling or steaming meat or fish to be cooked thoroughly without seasonings. Baeksuk is made with chicken or pheasant with plenty of water for several hours. However, the term generally indicates dakbaeksuk (닭백숙, chicken baeksuk), or chicken stew, whose recipe and ingredients are similar to samgyetang. While samgyetang is made with ginseng, various herbs, chestnuts, and jujubes, dakbaeksuk consists of simpler ingredients, such as chicken, water, and garlic. The chicken can be stuffed with glutinous rice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Korean_cuisine-Dak_hanmari-02.jpg/220px-Korean_cuisine-Dak_hanmari-02.jpg
