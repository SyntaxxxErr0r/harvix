74.3	Operation_Gladio	Operation Gladio	Operation Gladio (Italian: ) is the codename for a clandestine NATO "stay-behind" operation in Italy after World War II. Its purpose was to continue anti-communist actions in the event of a shift to a Communist party led government. Although Gladio specifically refers to the Italian branch of the NATO stay-behind organizations, "Operation Gladio" is used as an informal name for all stay-behind organizations, sometimes called "Super NATO". The name Gladio is the Italian form of gladius, a type of Roman shortsword.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Gladio.png/150px-Gladio.png
