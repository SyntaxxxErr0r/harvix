71.6	Open_source_hardware	Open-source hardware	Open source hardware (OSHW) consists of physical artifacts of technology designed and offered in the same manner as free and open source software (FOSS). Open source hardware is part of the open source culture movement and applies a like concept to a variety of components. The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned. Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings, schematics, bill of materials, PCB layout data, HDL source code and integrated circuit layout data), in addition to the software that drives the hardware, are all released with the FOSS approach.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Open_Source_Hardware_%28OSHW%29_Logo_on_blank_PCB.jpg/220px-Open_Source_Hardware_%28OSHW%29_Logo_on_blank_PCB.jpg
