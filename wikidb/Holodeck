103.0	Holodeck	Holodeck	A holodeck, in the fictional Star Trek universe, is a simulated reality facility located on starships and starbases. The first use of a "holodeck" by that name in the Star Trek universe was in the pilot episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, "Encounter at Farpoint", although a conceptually similar "recreation room" appeared in an episode of Star Trek: the Animated Series.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d3/Holodeck2.jpg/250px-Holodeck2.jpg
