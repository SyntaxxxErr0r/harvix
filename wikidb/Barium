61.2	Barium	Barium	Barium ( -ee-əm) is a chemical element with the symbol Ba and atomic number 56. It is the fifth element in Group 2, a soft silvery metallic alkaline earth metal. Barium is never found in nature in its pure form due to its reactivity with air. Its oxide is historically known as baryta but it reacts with water and carbon dioxide and is not found as a mineral. The most common naturally occurring minerals are the very insoluble barium sulfate, BaSO4 , and barium carbonate, BaCO3 (witherite). Barium's name originates from Greek barys (βαρύς), meaning "heavy", describing the high density of some common barium-containing ores.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Barium_unter_Argon_Schutzgas_Atmosph%C3%A4re.jpg/250px-Barium_unter_Argon_Schutzgas_Atmosph%C3%A4re.jpg
