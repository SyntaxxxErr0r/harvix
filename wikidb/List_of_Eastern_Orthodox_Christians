2.10	List_of_Eastern_Orthodox_Christians	List of Eastern Orthodox Christians	This is primarily a list of notable people who contributed to the history of Eastern Orthodox Christianity's theology or culture. However it is also for people whose Eastern Orthodox identity is an important part of their notability. As there are many nations that are predominantly Eastern Orthodox names from such nations should usually meet a stricter standard, but in the case of converts their conversion might be notable enough to make an exception.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Chirst_the_Redeemer_by_Andrey_Rublev.jpg/220px-Chirst_the_Redeemer_by_Andrey_Rublev.jpg
