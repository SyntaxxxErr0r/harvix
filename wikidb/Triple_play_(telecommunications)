53.8	Triple_play_(telecommunications)	Triple play (telecommunications)	In telecommunications, triple play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of two bandwidth-intensive services, high-speed Internet access and television, and a less bandwidth-demanding (but more latency-sensitive) service, telephone, over a single broadband connection. Triple play focuses on a combined business model rather than solving technical issues or a common standard. However, single standards like G.hn do exist to deliver all these services on a common platform.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Internet_Connectivity_Triple-Play.svg/260px-Internet_Connectivity_Triple-Play.svg.png
