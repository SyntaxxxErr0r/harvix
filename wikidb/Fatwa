84.0	Fatwa	Fatwā	A fatwā (Arabic: ‎; plural fatāwā Arabic: ‎) in the Islamic faith is a juristic ruling concerning Islamic law issued by an Islamic scholar. In Sunni Islam any fatwā is non-binding, whereas in Shia Islam it could be considered by an individual as binding, depending on his or her relation to the scholar. The person who issues a fatwā is called, in that respect, a mufti, i.e. an issuer of fatwā, from the verb أَفْتَى 'aftā = "he gave a formal legal opinion on". This is not necessarily a formal position since most Muslims argue that anyone trained in Islamic law may give an opinion (fatwā) on its teachings. If a fatwā does not break new ground, then it is simply called a ruling.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Allah-eser-green.png/180px-Allah-eser-green.png
