1.00	Raymond_Kertezc	Scientific control	Scientific control allows for comparisons of concepts. It is a part of the scientific method. Scientific control is often used in discussion of natural experiments. For instance, during drug testing, scientists will try to control two groups to keep them as identical and normal as possible, then allow one group to try the drug. Another example might be testing plant fertilizer by giving it to only half the plants in a garden (the plants that receive no fertilizer are the control group, because they are kept normal).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Starr_011107-0010_Argyroxiphium_sandwicense_subsp._macrocephalum.jpg/180px-Starr_011107-0010_Argyroxiphium_sandwicense_subsp._macrocephalum.jpg
