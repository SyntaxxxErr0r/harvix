53.8	Hoodoo_(geology)	Hoodoo (geology)	A hoodoo (also called a tent rock, fairy chimney, and earth pyramid) is a tall, thin spire of rock that protrudes from the bottom of an arid drainage basin or badland. Hoodoos consist of relatively soft rock topped by harder, less easily eroded stone that protects each column from the elements. They typically form within sedimentary rock and volcanic rock formations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/USA_10654_Bryce_Canyon_Luca_Galuzzi_2007.jpg/300px-USA_10654_Bryce_Canyon_Luca_Galuzzi_2007.jpg
