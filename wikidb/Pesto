60.1	Pesto	Pesto	Pesto is a sauce originating in Genoa in the Liguria region of northern Italy (pesto genovese) , and traditionally consists of crushed garlic, basil and European pine nuts blended with olive oil and Parmigiano Reggiano and Fiore Sardo (pecorino sardo). The name is the contracted past participle of the Genoese word pest√¢ (Italian: pestare), which means to pound, to crush, in reference to the original method of preparation, with marble mortar and wooden pestle. However, the ingredients in a traditionally made pesto are not "pounded" but "ground" with a circular motion of the pestle in the mortar. This same Latin root through Old French also gave rise to the English word pestle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Basil_leaves.jpg/220px-Basil_leaves.jpg
