3.20	National_anarchism	National-Anarchism	National-Anarchism is a radical, anti-capitalist, anti-statist, right-wing political and cultural ideology which emphasizes ethnic tribalism. As a prelude to an anticipated racial civil war and a collapse of the capitalist system, National-Anarchists seek to establish autonomous villages for v√∂lkisch communities, which have seceded from the state's economy and are no-go areas for unwelcomed ethnic groups and state authorities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/N-A_Flag.png/220px-N-A_Flag.png
