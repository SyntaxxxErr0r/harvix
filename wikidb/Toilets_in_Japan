66.4	Toilets_in_Japan	Toilets in Japan	There are two styles of toilets commonly found in Japan. The oldest type is a simple squat toilet, which is still somewhat common in public conveniences. After World War II, modern Western-type flush toilets and urinals became common. The current state of the art for Western-style toilets is the bidet toilet, which, as of March 2010, is installed in 72% of Japanese households. In Japan, these bidets are commonly called washlets, a brand name of Toto Ltd., and include many advanced features rarely seen outside of Asia. The feature set commonly found on washlets are anus washing, bidet washing, seat warming, and deodorization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/JapaneseToiletBidet.jpg/220px-JapaneseToiletBidet.jpg
