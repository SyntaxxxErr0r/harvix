153.3	Intelligence_quotient	Intelligence quotient	An intelligence quotient, or IQ, is a score derived from one of several different standardized tests designed to assess intelligence. The term "IQ" comes from the German Intelligenz-Quotient. When modern IQ tests are constructed, the mean (average) score within an age group is set to 100 and the standard deviation (SD) to 15. Today almost all IQ tests adhere to the assignment of 15 IQ points to each standard deviation, but this has not been the case historically. By construction, approximately 95% of the population scores within two SDs of the mean, i.e., has an IQ between 70 and 130.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/RavenMatrix.svg/220px-RavenMatrix.svg.png
