6.21	Ala_Moana_Beach_Park	Ala Moana Beach Park	Ala Moana Beach Park is a free public park on the island of Oahu, U.S. state of Hawaii, located between Waikiki and downtown Honolulu. This 100-acre (0.40 km2) park has a wide gold-sand beach that is over a half-mile (800 m) long. It's man-made and was created by the owner of the Dillingham Dredging Company, who was looking for a place to dispose of his dredged earth. So in the 1950s, sand was dumped at this park, which created the beach.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Ala_Moana_Beach_Park_Photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg/220px-Ala_Moana_Beach_Park_Photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg
