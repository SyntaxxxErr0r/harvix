108.6	Signal-to-noise_ratio	Signal-to-noise ratio	Signal-to-noise ratio (often abbreviated SNR or S/N) is a measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise. It is defined as the ratio of signal power to the noise power. A ratio higher than 1:1 indicates more signal than noise. While SNR is commonly quoted for electrical signals, it can be applied to any form of signal (such as isotope levels in an ice core or biochemical signaling between cells).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Analyse_thermo_gravimetrique_bruit.png/220px-Analyse_thermo_gravimetrique_bruit.png
