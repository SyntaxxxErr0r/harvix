1.00	Zhang_Han_(Qin_Dynasty)	Zhang Han (Qin Dynasty)	Zhang Han (died 205 BC) was a military general of the Qin Dynasty. When uprisings erupted throughout China during the reign of Qin Er Shi, Zhang led the Qin armies and successfully quelled several of these rebel forces. In 207 BC, Zhang was defeated by Xiang Yu of Chu at the Battle of Julu and surrendered with his 200,000 troops. He was conferred the title of "King of Yong" (雍王) by Xiang and given part of the lands in Guanzhong as his fief when Xiang split the fallen Qin empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. Zhang's territory was conquered by Liu Bang in 205 BC, and he committed suicide a year later.
