80.1	The_Crystal_Palace	The Crystal Palace	The Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass building originally erected in Hyde Park, London, England, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851. More than 14,000 exhibitors from around the world gathered in the Palace's 990,000 square feet (92,000 m2) of exhibition space to display examples of the latest technology developed in the Industrial Revolution. Designed by Joseph Paxton, the Great Exhibition building was 1,851 feet (564 m) long, with an interior height of 128 feet (39 m). Because of the recent invention of the cast plate glass method in 1848, which allowed for large sheets of cheap but strong glass, it was at the time the largest amount of glass ever seen in a building and astonished visitors with its clear walls and ceilings that didn't require interior lights, thus a "Crystal Palace".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Crystal_Palace_General_view_from_Water_Temple.jpg/340px-Crystal_Palace_General_view_from_Water_Temple.jpg
