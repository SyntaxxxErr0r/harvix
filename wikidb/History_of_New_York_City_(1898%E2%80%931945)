2.30	History_of_New_York_City_(1898%E2%80%931945)	History of New York City (1898–1945)	The history of New York City (1898–1945) began with the formation of the consolidated city of the five boroughs in 1898. New transportation links, most notably the New York City Subway, first opened 1904, helped bind the new city together. Increased European immigration brought social upheaval. Later, in the 1920s, the city saw the influx of African Americans as part of the Great Migration from the American South, and the Harlem Renaissance. The Roaring Twenties were years of glamour and wealth, highlighted by a construction boom with skyscrapers dueling in the skyline. New York's financial sector came to dominate the national, and indeed the world economy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/View_of_Woolworth_Building_fixed.jpg/230px-View_of_Woolworth_Building_fixed.jpg
