63.2	Force_(Star_Wars)	Force (Star Wars)	The Force is referenced several times throughout the Star Wars saga. In A New Hope, there are several mentions of the Force in reference to Luke Skywalker: by Obi-Wan Kenobi ("It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.", "Use the Force, Luke." and "The Force will be with you, always.") and Darth Vader ("The Force is strong with this one.") The famous line "May the Force be with you" is actually said by General Dodonna after explaining the Death Star attack plan to the Rebel pilots. It is said again by Han Solo to Luke, right before the attack on the Death Star battle station.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Yodausingforce.JPG
