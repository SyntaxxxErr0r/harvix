1.10	Reverse_Cuthill-McKee_algorithm	Cuthill–McKee algorithm	In the mathematical subfield of matrix theory, the Cuthill–McKee algorithm (named for Elizabeth Cuthill and J. McKee) is an algorithm to permute a sparse matrix that has a symmetric sparsity pattern into a band matrix form with a small bandwidth. The reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm due to Alan George is the same algorithm but with the resulting index numbers reversed. In practice this generally results in less fill-in than the CM ordering when Gaussian elimination is applied.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Can_73_orig.pdf/page1-220px-Can_73_orig.pdf.jpg
