1.10	Three-tier_architecture	Multitier architecture	In software engineering, multi-tier architecture (often referred to as n-tier architecture) is a clientâ€“server architecture in which the presentation, the application processing, and the data management are logically separate processes. For example, an application that uses middleware to service data requests between a user and a database employs multi-tier architecture. The most widespread use of multi-tier architecture is the three-tier architecture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Overview_of_a_three-tier_application_vectorVersion.svg/350px-Overview_of_a_three-tier_application_vectorVersion.svg.png
