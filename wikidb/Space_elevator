157.9	Space_elevator	Space elevator	A space elevator is a proposed structure designed to transport material from Earth's surface directly into space or orbit without using large rockets. The concept is also applicable to other planets and celestial bodies. Many elevator variants have been suggested, all of which involve traveling along a fixed structure instead of using rocket-powered space launch. The fixed structure is most often a cable that reaches from the surface of the Earth on or near the equator, up through the level of geostationary orbit (GSO), and terminating at a counterweight well above that level.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Space_elevator_structural_diagram--corrected_for_scale%2BCM%2Betc.TIF/lossy-page1-300px-Space_elevator_structural_diagram--corrected_for_scale%2BCM%2Betc.TIF.jpg
