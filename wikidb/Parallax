206.3	Parallax	Parallax	Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. The term is derived from the Greek παράλλαξις , meaning "alteration". Nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Parallax_Example.svg/300px-Parallax_Example.svg.png
