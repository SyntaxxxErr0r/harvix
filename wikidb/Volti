1.00	Volti	Volti	Volti is a 20-person professional choir based in San Francisco. The choir was founded by Robert Geary in the fall of 1979 as the San Francisco Chamber Singers and beginning with an all-Bach program. The group quickly moved on to the more contemporary works that have shaped its mission ever since "to encourage, foster and showcase contemporary American music and composers, and to introduce contemporary vocal music from around the world to local audience." When the group turned 25 in 2003-2004, it changed its name to Volti - a reference to the Italian musical instruction "volti subito" meaning "turn quickly."
