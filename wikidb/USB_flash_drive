188.7	USB_flash_drive	USB flash drive	A USB flash drive is a data storage device that includes flash memory with an integrated Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface. USB flash drives are typically removable and rewritable, and physically much smaller than a floppy disk. Most weigh less than 30 g. As of January 2012 drives of 256GB were available, 512GB and 1 terabytes (TB) drives were in planning, and storage capacities as large as 2 terabytes are planned, with steady improvements in size and price per capacity expected. Some allow up to 100,000 write/erase cycles (depending on the exact type of memory chip used) and 10 years shelf storage time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/SanDisk_Cruzer_Micro.png/220px-SanDisk_Cruzer_Micro.png
