It shows Fairman Rogers driving a coaching party in his four-in-hand carriage through Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. It is thought to be the first painting to examine precisely, through systematic photographic analysis, how horses move.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/A_may_morning_in_the_park_thomas_eakins.jpeg/350px-A_may_morning_in_the_park_thomas_eakins.jpeg
