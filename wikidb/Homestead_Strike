51.6	Homestead_Strike	Homestead Strike	The Homestead Strike was an industrial lockout and strike which began on June 30, 1892, culminating in a battle between strikers and private security agents on July 6, 1892. The battle was the second largest and one of the most serious disputes in U.S. labor history second only to the Battle of Blair Mountain. The dispute occurred at the Homestead Steel Works in the town of Homestead, Pennsylvania, between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (the AA) and the Carnegie Steel Company. The final result was a major defeat for the union and a setback for efforts to unionize steelworkers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/PamphletHomesteadStrikeLyrics1892.jpg/350px-PamphletHomesteadStrikeLyrics1892.jpg
