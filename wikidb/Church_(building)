80.1	Church_(building)	Church (building)	In the Christian religion, a church building is a building or structure whose primary purpose is to facilitate the meeting of a Christian Church. Originally, Jewish Christians met in synagogues, such as the Cenacle, and in one another's homes, known as house churches. As Christianity grew and became more accepted by governments , notably with the Edict of Milan, rooms and, eventually, entire buildings were set aside for the explicit purpose of Christian worship, such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Pisgah.jpg/220px-Pisgah.jpg
