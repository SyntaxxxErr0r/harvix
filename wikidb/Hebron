72.4	Hebron	Hebron	Hebron ; Hebrew: Â·), Standard Hebrew: , Tiberian: ISO 259-3: ), is located in the southern West Bank, 30 km (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. Nestled in the Judean Mountains, it lies 930 meters (3,050 ft) above sea level. It is the largest city in the West Bank and home to around 165,000 Palestinians, and over 500 Jewish settlers concentrated in and around the old quarter. The city is most notable for containing the traditional burial site of the biblical Patriarchs and Matriarchs and is therefore considered the second-holiest city in Judaism after Jerusalem. The city is also venerated by Muslims for its association with Abraham and was traditionally viewed as one of the "four holy cities of Islam."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Hebron172.JPG/250px-Hebron172.JPG
