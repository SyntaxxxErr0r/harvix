2.11	Ewha_Woman's_University_Station	Ewha Woman's University Station	Ewha Womans University Station is a station on the Seoul Subway Line 2. As its name indicates, it serves the nearby Ewha Womans University, although Sinchon Station on the Gyeongui Line is closer to the school. This station is somewhat interesting in the fact that although technically it has one island platform with both rail tracks running on opposite sides, the two boarding areas with screen doors are essentially blocked off from each other, and are connected only by a few long and narrow passageways. Some people actually mistake this station to have two side platforms that are adjacent to each other.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Ehwst01.jpg/230px-Ehwst01.jpg
