111.1	Spanish_Inquisition	Spanish Inquisition	The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition (Spanish: ), commonly known as the Spanish Inquisition , was a tribunal established in 1480 by Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms, and to replace the Medieval Inquisition which was under Papal control. The Inquisition was originally intended in large part to ensure the orthodoxy of those who converted from Judaism and Islam. This regulation of the faith of the newly converted was intensified after the royal decrees issued in 1492 and 1501 ordering Jews and Muslims to convert or leave.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Seal_for_the_Tribunal_of_the_Holy_Office_of_the_Inquisition_%28Spain%29.png/193px-Seal_for_the_Tribunal_of_the_Holy_Office_of_the_Inquisition_%28Spain%29.png
