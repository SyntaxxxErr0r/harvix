It chronicles the journey of Able of the High Heart, an American boy transported to a magical world and supernaturally aged to adulthood. Able (which is not his real name, but rather the name given to him) becomes a knight, and because of his connection with the magical and spiritual elements of the world around him is soon also dubbed a wizard.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/The_knight%28novel%29.jpg/200px-The_knight%28novel%29.jpg
