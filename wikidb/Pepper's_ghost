77.0	Pepper's_ghost	Pepper's ghost	Pepper's ghost is an illusionary technique used in theatre and in some magic tricks. Using a plate glass and special lighting techniques, it can make objects seem to appear or disappear, transparent, or make one object seem to morph into another. It is named after John Henry Pepper, who first demonstrated the technique in the 1860s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Peppers_ghost_low_angle.jpg/250px-Peppers_ghost_low_angle.jpg
