2.00	Mechanical_splice	Mechanical splice	A mechanical splice is a junction of two or more optical fibers that are aligned and held in place by a self-contained assembly (usually the size of a large carpenter's nail). The fibers aren't permanently joined, just precisely held together so that light can pass from one to another.
