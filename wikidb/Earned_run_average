59.3	Earned_run_average	Earned run average	In baseball statistics, earned run average is the mean of earned runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings pitched. It is determined by dividing the number of earned runs allowed by the number of innings pitched and multiplying by nine. Runs resulting from defensive errors (including pitchers' defensive errors) are recorded as unearned runs and are not used to determine ERA.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Ed_Walsh_portrait_1911.jpg/250px-Ed_Walsh_portrait_1911.jpg
