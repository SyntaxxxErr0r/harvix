54.9	Chikungunya	Chikungunya	Chikungunya (in the Makonde language "that which bends up") virus (CHIKV) is an insect-borne virus, of the genus Alphavirus, that is transmitted to humans by virus-carrying Aedes mosquitoes. There have been recent breakouts of CHIKV associated with severe illness. CHIKV infection causes an illness with symptoms similar to dengue fever, with an acute febrile phase of the illness lasting only two to five days, followed by a prolonged arthralgic disease that affects the joints of the extremities. The pain associated with CHIKV infection of the joints persists for weeks or months, or in some cases years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Aedes_aegypti_biting_human.jpg/220px-Aedes_aegypti_biting_human.jpg
