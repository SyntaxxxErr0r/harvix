The park is administered and maintained by California State Parks. It is located 37 miles (60 km) south of Carmel and covers over 3,000 acres (12 km2) of land. A main feature of the park is McWay Falls, which drops over a cliff 80 feet (24.4 m) into the Pacific Ocean, as well as the smaller McWay Creek Falls. Also, the park is home to 400 feet redwoods which are over 3,500 years old. The park is named after Julia Pfeiffer Burns, a respected resident and rancher in the Big Sur region in the early 20th century, who lived in the area for much of her life until her death in 1928.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/McWay_cove_1.jpg/284px-McWay_cove_1.jpg
