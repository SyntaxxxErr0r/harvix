70.4	Bell_System_divestiture	Bell System divestiture	The Bell System divestiture, or the breakup of AT&amp;T, was initiated by the filing in 1974 by the U.S. Department of Justice of an antitrust lawsuit against AT&amp;T. The case, United States v. AT&amp;T, led to a settlement finalized on January 8, 1982, under which "Bell System" agreed to divest its local exchange service operating companies, in return for a chance to go into the computer business, AT&amp;T Computer Systems. Effective January 1, 1984, AT&amp;T's local operations were split into seven independent Regional Holding Companies, also known as Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), or "Baby Bells". Afterwards, AT&amp;T, reduced in value by approximately 70%, continued to operate all of its long-distance services, although in the ensuing years it lost portions of its market share to competitors such as MCI and Sprint.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/VerizonBell.jpg/200px-VerizonBell.jpg
