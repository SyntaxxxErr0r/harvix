Its northern suburb of Pensarn lies on the Irish Sea coast and is known for its beach, where it is claimed by some that a ghost ship has been sighted. Abergele and Pensarn railway station serves both resorts. Abergele is often overlooked due to the popularity of nearby Rhyl, Prestatyn, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Conwy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/The_1868_Rail_Disaster_Memorial_-_geograph.org.uk_-_377402.jpg/240px-The_1868_Rail_Disaster_Memorial_-_geograph.org.uk_-_377402.jpg
