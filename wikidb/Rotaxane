10.28	Rotaxane	Rotaxane	A rotaxane is a mechanically-interlocked molecular architecture consisting of a "dumbbell shaped molecule" which is threaded through a "macrocycle" (see graphical representation). The name is derived from the Latin for wheel (rota) and axle (axis). The two components of a rotaxane are kinetically trapped since the ends of the dumbbell (often called stoppers) are larger than the internal diameter of the ring and prevent disassociation (unthreading) of the components since this would require significant distortion of the covalent bonds.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Rotaxane_cartoon.jpg/250px-Rotaxane_cartoon.jpg
