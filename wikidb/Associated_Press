The AP is a cooperative owned by its contributing newspapers, radio and television stations in the United States, which both contribute stories to the AP and use material written by its staff journalists. Many newspapers and broadcasters outside the United States are AP subscribers, paying a fee to use AP material without being contributing members of the cooperative.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Associated_Press_logo_2012.svg/100px-Associated_Press_logo_2012.svg.png
