71.3	Composite_video	Composite video	Composite video is the format of an analog television (picture only) signal before it is combined with a sound signal and modulated onto an RF carrier. In contrast to component video it contains all required video information, including colors in a single line-level signal. Like component video, composite-video cables do not carry audio and are often paired with audio cables (see RCA connector).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Composite_Video.svg/350px-Composite_Video.svg.png
