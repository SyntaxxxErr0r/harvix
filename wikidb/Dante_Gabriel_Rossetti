57.0	Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti	Dante Gabriel Rossetti	Dante Gabriel Rossetti (12 May 1828 â€“ 9 April 1882) was an English poet, illustrator, painter and translator. He founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 with William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, and was later to be the main inspiration for a second generation of artists and writers influenced by the movement, most notably William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. His work also influenced the European Symbolists and was a major precursor of the Aesthetic movement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_by_George_Frederic_Watts.jpg/220px-Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_by_George_Frederic_Watts.jpg
