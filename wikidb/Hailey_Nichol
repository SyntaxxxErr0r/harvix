4.00	Hailey_Nichol	Hailey Nichol	Hailey Nichol is a fictional character on the FOX television series The O.C., portrayed by Amanda Righetti. Seen as something of a black sheep of the family, Hailey is the younger daughter of Caleb and Rose Nichol, younger sister to Kirsten Cohen, and older half-sister to Lindsay Gardner. It is not known if she ever met her half-sister Lindsay since they never appeared in an episode together. Nichol was not seen in either season three or four, though it can be assumed that she is living in Japan working still in fashion retail. Righetti is 6 years younger than Benjamin McKenzie and 4 years younger than Adam Brody, even though her character is 11 years older than them.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Hailey_Nichol_OC.jpg/200px-Hailey_Nichol_OC.jpg
