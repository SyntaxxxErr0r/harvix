54.1	High_frequency	High frequency	High frequency (HF) radio frequencies are between 3 and 30 MHz. Also known as the decameter band or decameter wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten decameters (ten to one hundred metres). Frequencies immediately below HF are denoted Medium-frequency (MF), and the next higher frequencies are known as Very high frequency (VHF). The Shortwave range (2.310 - 25.820 MHz) used by international broadcasters is part of the HF frequency spectrum. In aviation virtually the entire spectrum (2 - 29.999 MHz) is used for HF communications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Icom_M700Pro.jpg/220px-Icom_M700Pro.jpg
