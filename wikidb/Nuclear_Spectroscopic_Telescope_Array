8.41	Nuclear_Spectroscopic_Telescope_Array	Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array	Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array is a planned space-based X-ray telescope that will use a Wolter telescope to focus high energy X-rays at 5 to 80 keV from astrophysical sources, especially for nuclear spectroscopy. It is the eleventh mission of the NASA Small Explorer satellite program (SMEX-11) and the first space-based direct-imaging X-ray telescope at energies beyond those of the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton. The planned mission launch scheduled for 21 March 2012 was postponed by software issues with the launch vehicle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/NuStar_1.jpg/250px-NuStar_1.jpg
