58.0	Bonaire	Bonaire	Bonaire (Dutch: , Papiamentu: Boneiru) is a special municipality (officially public body) of the Netherlands, consisting of the Caribbean island of Bonaire and, nestled in its western crescent, the uninhabited islet of Klein Bonaire. Together with Aruba and Cura√ßao it forms a group referred to as the ABC islands of the Leeward Antilles, the southern island chain of the Lesser Antilles. The name Bonaire is thought to have originally come from the Caiquetio word 'Bonay'. The early Spanish and Dutch modified its spelling to Bojnaj and also Bonaire, which means "Good Air".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Flag_of_Bonaire.svg/125px-Flag_of_Bonaire.svg.png
