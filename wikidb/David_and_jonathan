1.30	David_and_jonathan	David and Jonathan	David and Jonathan (Hebrew: ; Yəhōnāṯān or Yehonatan) were heroic figures of the Kingdom of Israel, whose covenant was recorded favourably in the books of Samuel. Jonathan was the son of Saul, king of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, and David was the son of Jesse of Bethlehem and Jonathan's presumed rival for the crown. David became king. The covenant the two men had formed eventually led to David graciously seating Jonathan's son Mephibosheth, a cripple, at his own royal table instead of eradicating the former king Saul's line.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/Jonathan_Embraces_David_from_Caspar_Luiken.jpg/220px-Jonathan_Embraces_David_from_Caspar_Luiken.jpg
