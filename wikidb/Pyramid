88.5	Pyramid	Pyramid	A pyramid (from Greek: ) is a structure whose shape is roughly that of a pyramid in the geometric sense; that is, its outer surfaces are triangular and converge to a single point at the top. The base of a pyramid can be trilateral, quadrilateral, or any polygon shape, meaning that a pyramid has at least three outer triangular surfaces (at least four faces including the base). The square pyramid, with square base and four triangular outer surfaces, is a common version.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Giza-pyramids.JPG/220px-Giza-pyramids.JPG
