65.6	Dot_product	Dot product	In mathematics, the dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors) and returns a single number obtained by multiplying corresponding entries and then summing those products. The name "dot product" is derived from the centered dot " " that is often used to designate this operation; the alternative name "scalar product" emphasizes the scalar (rather than vector) nature of the result.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Dot_Product.svg/300px-Dot_Product.svg.png
