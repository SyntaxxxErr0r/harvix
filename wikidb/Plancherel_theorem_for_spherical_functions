2.00	Plancherel_theorem_for_spherical_functions	Plancherel theorem for spherical functions	Let G be a semisimple Lie group and K a maximal compact subgroup of G. The Hecke algebra Cc , consisting of compactly supported K-biinvariant continuous functions on G, acts by convolution on the Hilbert space H=L2(G / K). Because G / K is a symmetric space, this *-algebra is commutative. The closure of its image in the operator norm is a non-unital commutative C* algebra , so by the Gelfand isomorphism can be identified with the continuous functions vanishing at infinity on its spectrum X. Points in the spectrum are given by continuous *-homomorphisms of into C, i.e. characters of .
