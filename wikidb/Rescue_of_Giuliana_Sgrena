12.72	Rescue_of_Giuliana_Sgrena	Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena	The Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena was a covert operation by the Italian military secret service, SISMI, to rescue Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena from kidnappers in Iraq. After the successful retrieval of Ms Sgrena, on March 4, 2005, the car with her and two secret agents came under friendly fire by US Army troops along the Baghdad airport road; secret agent Nicola Calipari was killed by US Army Specialist Mario Lozano. The incident created tension between the two countries, and arguably increased public hostility in the Italian public towards the United States of America.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Negroponte_iraq.jpg/220px-Negroponte_iraq.jpg
