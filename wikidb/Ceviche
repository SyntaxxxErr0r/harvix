112.6	Ceviche	Ceviche	Ceviche (also spelled cebiche or seviche) is a seafood dish popular in the coastal regions of the Americas, especially Central and South America, and the Philippines. The dish is typically made from fresh raw fish marinated in citrus juices such as lemon or lime and spiced with chilli peppers. Additional seasonings such as onion, salt, coriander/cilantro, and pepper may also be added. Ceviche is usually accompanied by side dishes that complement its flavors such as sweet potato, lettuce, corn, or avocado. As the dish is not cooked with heat, it must be prepared fresh to minimize the risk of food poisoning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Ceviche_del_Per%C3%BA.jpg/230px-Ceviche_del_Per%C3%BA.jpg
