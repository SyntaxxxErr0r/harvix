58.4	Real_tennis	Real tennis	A real tennis court is a very substantial building (encompassing an area wider and longer than a lawn tennis court, with high walls and a ceiling lofty enough to contain all but the highest lob shots). It is enclosed by walls on all four sides, three of which have sloping roofs, known as "penthouses", beneath which are various openings ("galleries", from which spectators may view the game), and a buttress that intrudes into the playing area (tambour) off which shots may be played. Courts (except for the one at Falkland Palace, a jeu quarré design) share the same basic layout but have slightly different dimensions. Most are about 110 by 39 feet (34 × 12 m) above the penthouses, and about 96 by 32 feet (29 × 9.8 m) on the playing floor, varying by a foot or two per court. They are doubly asymmetric: each end of the court differs in shape from the other, and the left and right sides of the court are also different.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Jesmond-Dene-tennis-court.jpg/220px-Jesmond-Dene-tennis-court.jpg
