51.6	Minimal_techno	Minimal techno	Minimalist techno is a minimalist sub-genre of techno. It is characterized by a stripped-down aesthetic that exploits the use of repetition, and understated development. Minimal techno is thought to have been originally developed in the early 1990s by Detroit based producers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell, although what is currently referred to as 'minimal' largely developed in Germany during the 2000s, and was popularised by labels such as Kompakt and M-nus.
