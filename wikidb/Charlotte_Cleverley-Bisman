She was nicknamed "Miraculous Baby Charlotte" by her fellow New Zealanders as a result of making headlines worldwide after recuperating from a series of life-threatening complications. She is believed to be the smallest baby to have survived such a severe infection and the subsequent quadruple amputations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Charlotte_Cleverley-Bisman.jpg/220px-Charlotte_Cleverley-Bisman.jpg
