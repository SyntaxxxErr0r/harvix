55.3	Salisbury	Salisbury	Salisbury ( -bree or -bree, or locally ) is a cathedral city in Wiltshire, England and the only city in the county. It is the second largest settlement (with the largest being Swindon) in the county. It has also been called New Sarum to distinguish it from the original site of settlement to the north of the city at Old Sarum, but this alternative name is not in common use.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Salisbury_Cathedral.jpg/240px-Salisbury_Cathedral.jpg
