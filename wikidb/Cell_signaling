59.3	Cell_signaling	Cell signaling	Cell signaling is part of a complex system of communication that governs basic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions. The ability of cells to perceive and correctly respond to their microenvironment is the basis of development, tissue repair, and immunity as well as normal tissue homeostasis. Errors in cellular information processing are responsible for diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes. By understanding cell signaling, diseases may be treated effectively and, theoretically, artificial tissues may be created.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/USDAbacteria.jpg/220px-USDAbacteria.jpg
