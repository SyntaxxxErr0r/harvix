132.0	Julia_set	Julia set	In the context of complex dynamics, a topic of mathematics, the Julia set and the Fatou set are two complementary sets defined from a function. Informally, the Fatou set of the function consists of values with the property that all nearby values behave similarly under repeated iteration of the function, and the Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values. Thus the behavior of the function on the Fatou set is 'regular', while on the Julia set its behavior is 'chaotic'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Julia_set_%28ice%29.png/256px-Julia_set_%28ice%29.png
