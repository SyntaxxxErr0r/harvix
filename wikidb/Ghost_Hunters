The program features paranormal investigators Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson who investigate places that are reported to be haunted. The two originally worked as plumbers for Roto-Rooter as a day job while investigating locations at night. Since the show's success, the series now takes precedence in their lives, but they are still honorary employees with the company and continue to do jobs for them if time permits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/Ghost_Hunters_logo.jpg/230px-Ghost_Hunters_logo.jpg
