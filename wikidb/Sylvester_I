4.20	Sylvester_I	Pope Sylvester I	Pope Sylvester I served as pope from 31 January 314 to 31 December 335, succeeding Pope Miltiades. He filled the See of Rome at an important era in the history of the Catholic Church, yet very little is known of him. The accounts of the papacy of Pope Sylvester I preserved in the Liber Pontificalis (7th or 8th century) are little else than a record of the gifts said to have been conferred on the Church by Constantine I, but it does say that he was the son of a Roman named Rufinus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Sylvester_I_and_Constantine.jpg/300px-Sylvester_I_and_Constantine.jpg
