1.00	Tami_Show	T.A.M.I. Show	T.A.M.I. Show is a 1964 concert film, released by American International Pictures. It includes performances by numerous popular rock and roll and R&amp;B musicians from the United States and England. It was shot by director Steve Binder and his crew from The Steve Allen Show using specially developed "Electronovision" TV cameras, the second of a handful of productions that used the system. By capturing more than 800 lines of resolution at 25 frame/s, it could be converted to film via kinescope recording with sufficient enhanced resolution to allow big-screen enlargement. It is considered one of the seminal events in the pioneering of music films, and more importantly, the later concept of music videos.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/31/TheTAMIShow.jpg/220px-TheTAMIShow.jpg
