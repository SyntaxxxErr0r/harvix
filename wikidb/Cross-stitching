4.00	Cross-stitching	Cross-stitch	Cross-stitch is a popular form of counted-thread embroidery in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture. Cross-stitch is often executed on easily countable evenweave fabric called aida cloth. The stitcher counts the threads in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called counted cross-stitch in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch. Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric ; the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Stickmuster_1735.jpg/250px-Stickmuster_1735.jpg
