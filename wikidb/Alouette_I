1.01	Alouette_I	Alouette 1	Alouette 1 was Canada's first satellite, and the first satellite constructed by a country other than the USSR or the United States. Occasionally, Alouette 1 is misrepresented as the third satellite successfully put in orbit, rather than being from the third country to have one of its own in space, but numerous US and Soviet missions preceded it. Furthermore, Canada was not the third country to have a satellite in orbit: the United Kingdom's Ariel 1 preceded Alouette 1, but that was constructed by NASA. The name "Alouette" came from the French "skylark" and from the title of a popular French-Canadian folk song, "Alouette".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Alouette_1.jpg/250px-Alouette_1.jpg
