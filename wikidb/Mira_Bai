Some 1,200–1,300 prayerful songs or bhajans attributed to her are popular throughout India and have been published in several translations worldwide. In the bhakti tradition, they are in passionate praise of Lord Krishna.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Meerabai_painting.jpg/220px-Meerabai_painting.jpg
