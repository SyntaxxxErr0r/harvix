56.4	Polaroid_Corporation	Polaroid Corporation	Polaroid Corporation is an American-based international consumer electronics and eyewear company, originally founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land. It is most famous for its instant film cameras, which reached the market in 1948, and continued to be the company's flagship product line until the February 2008 decision to cease all production in favor of digital photography products. The company's original dominant market was in polarized sunglasses, an outgrowth of Land's self-guided research in polarization after leaving Harvard University after his freshman yearâ€”he later returned to Harvard to continue his research.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Polaroid_logo.svg/230px-Polaroid_logo.svg.png
