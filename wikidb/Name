54.9	Name	Name	A name is a word or term used for identification. Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies a specific unique and identifiable individual person, and may or may not include a middle name. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes, more loosely, called names; an older term for them, now obsolete, is "general names".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Child_baptism.jpg/300px-Child_baptism.jpg
