57.4	Berkshire	Berkshire	Berkshire ( or , abbreviated Berks) is both a ceremonial county and a historic county of England. The administrative county of Berkshire including the Berkshire County Council were abolished in 1998. The county is often referred to as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of the royal residence of Windsor Castle in the county; this usage, which dates to the 19th century at least, was recognised by the Queen in 1957, and letters patent issued confirming this in 1974.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Berkshire_UK_locator_map_2010.svg/250px-Berkshire_UK_locator_map_2010.svg.png
