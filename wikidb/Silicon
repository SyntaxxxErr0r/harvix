127.5	Silicon	Silicon	Silicon ( -ə-kən or -ə-kon) is a chemical element with the symbol Si and atomic number 14. A tetravalent metalloid, it is less reactive than its chemical analog carbon, the nonmetal directly above it in the periodic table, but more reactive than germanium, the metalloid directly below it in the table. Controversy about silicon's character dates to its discovery: silicon was first prepared and characterized in pure form in 1824, and given the name silicium (from Latin: , flints), with an -ium word-ending to suggest a metal, a name which the element retains in several non-English languages. However, its final English name, suggested in 1831, reflects the more physically similar elements carbon and boron.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/SiliconCroda.jpg/250px-SiliconCroda.jpg
