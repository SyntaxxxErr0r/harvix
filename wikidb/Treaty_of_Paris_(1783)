63.4	Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)	Treaty of Paris (1783)	The Treaty of Paris, signed on September 3, 1783, ended the American Revolutionary War between Great Britain on one side and the United States of America and its allies on the other. The other combatant nations, France, Spain and the Dutch Republic had separate agreements; for details of these, and the negotiations which produced all four treaties, see Peace of Paris (1783). It is most famous for being "exceedingly generous" to the United States in terms of enlarged boundaries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/PreliminaryTreatyOfParisPainting.jpg/300px-PreliminaryTreatyOfParisPainting.jpg
