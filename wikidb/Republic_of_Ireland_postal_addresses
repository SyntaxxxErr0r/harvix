1.01	Republic_of_Ireland_postal_addresses	Republic of Ireland postal addresses	In Ireland, postal addresses do not use a post code system. Rural addresses are specified by the county, nearest post town, and the townland. Urban addresses are specified by county, city or town name, street name, house number, and apartment or flat number where relevant. A house name may be used instead of a number.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Dublin_DPD_Street_sign.png/220px-Dublin_DPD_Street_sign.png
