76.6	Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan	Upper Peninsula of Michigan	The Upper Peninsula of Michigan is the northern of the two major land masses that make up the U.S. state of Michigan. It is commonly referred to as the Upper Peninsula, the U.P., or Upper Michigan. It is also known as the land "above the Bridge" linking the two peninsulas. The peninsula is bounded on the north by Lake Superior, on the east by the St. Mary's River, on the southeast by Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and on the southwest by Wisconsin. Based on geographical differences, the peninsula is sometimes divided into the Western Upper Peninsula ("WUP") and Eastern Upper Peninsula ("EUP").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Porcupine_Mountains_Michigan.jpg/256px-Porcupine_Mountains_Michigan.jpg
