4.11	Helaman	Helaman	According to the Book of Mormon, Helaman ( -lə-mən) was a Nephite prophet and soldier who lived around the 1st century BC. He is perhaps best known in LDS theology for leading into battle an army of two thousand young warriors, which he referred to as his two thousand sons. Most of the parts of the narrative involving Helaman come from the latter half of the Book of Alma.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Mormon-book.jpg/120px-Mormon-book.jpg
