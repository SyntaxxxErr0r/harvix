115.3	Sorting_algorithm	Sorting algorithm	The following table describes integer sorting algorithms and other sorting algorithms that are not comparison sorts. As such, they are not limited by a lower bound. Complexities below are in terms of n, the number of items to be sorted, k, the size of each key, and d, the digit size used by the implementation. Many of them are based on the assumption that the key size is large enough that all entries have unique key values, and hence that n &lt;&lt; 2k, where &lt;&lt; means "much less than."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Bubblesort-edited.png/220px-Bubblesort-edited.png
