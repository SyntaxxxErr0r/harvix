3.20	John_Paul_Jones_House	John Paul Jones House	The John Paul Jones House was the home of Captain Gregory Purcell and his wife in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. They had it built in 1758 and Purcell lived there until his death in 1776. The widow Purcell then took in boarders. American naval hero John Paul Jones rented a room during 1781-1782 while supervising construction of the ship America. This is the only surviving building in the United States known to have been associated with John Paul Jones.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Portsmouth%2C_NH_-_John_Paul_Jones_House.JPG/250px-Portsmouth%2C_NH_-_John_Paul_Jones_House.JPG
