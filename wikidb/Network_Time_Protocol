152.3	Network_Time_Protocol	Network Time Protocol	NTP uses a hierarchical, semi-layered system of levels of clock sources. Each level of this hierarchy is termed a stratum and is assigned a layer number starting with 0 (zero) at the top. The stratum level defines its distance from the reference clock and exists to prevent cyclical dependencies in the hierarchy. It is important to note that the stratum is not an indication of quality or reliability, it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2 time sources. This definition of stratum is also different from the notion of clock strata used in telecommunication systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Network_Time_Protocol_servers_and_clients.svg/350px-Network_Time_Protocol_servers_and_clients.svg.png
