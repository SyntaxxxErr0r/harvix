56.1	Altitude	Altitude	Altitude or height is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, and more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or "up" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Vertical_distances.svg/300px-Vertical_distances.svg.png
