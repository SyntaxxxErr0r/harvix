120.1	Munich_massacre	Munich massacre	The Munich massacre is an informal name for events that occurred during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Bavaria in southern West Germany, when members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage and eventually killed by the Palestinian group Black September. Shortly after the crisis began, the Palestinians demanded the release of 234 prisoners held in Israeli jails. Black September called the operation "Ikrit and Biram", after two Christian Palestinian villages whose inhabitants were killed or expelled by the Haganah in 1948.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2b/Ap_munich905_t.jpg/220px-Ap_munich905_t.jpg
