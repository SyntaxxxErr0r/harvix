51.5	Image_map	Image map	In HTML and XHTML , an image map is a list of coordinates relating to a specific image, created in order to hyperlink areas of the image to various destinations (as opposed to a normal image link, in which the entire area of the image links to a single destination). For example, a map of the world may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. The intention of an image map is to provide an easy way of linking various parts of an image without dividing the image into separate image files.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/JoshuaReynoldsParty.jpg/350px-JoshuaReynoldsParty.jpg
