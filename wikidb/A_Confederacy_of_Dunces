The book, published through the efforts of writer Walker Percy (who also contributed a revealing foreword) and Toole's mother Thelma Toole, quickly became a cult classic, and later a mainstream success. Toole posthumously won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981. It is now considered a canonical work of modern Southern literature, in the USA.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Confederacy_of_dunces_cover.jpg/200px-Confederacy_of_dunces_cover.jpg
