64.5	Porter_5_forces_analysis	Porter five forces analysis	Porter's five forces analysis is a framework for industry analysis and business strategy development formed by Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School in 1979. It draws upon industrial organization (IO) economics to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and therefore attractiveness of a market. Attractiveness in this context refers to the overall industry profitability. An "unattractive" industry is one in which the combination of these five forces acts to drive down overall profitability. A very unattractive industry would be one approaching "pure competition", in which available profits for all firms are driven to normal profit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Porters_five_forces.PNG/250px-Porters_five_forces.PNG
