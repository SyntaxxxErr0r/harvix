1.00	Havoc_(comics)	Havok (comics)	Havok is a fictional character, a mutant superhero in the Marvel Comics Universe and member of the X-Men. He first appears in Uncanny X-Men No.54 (March 1969), and was created by Arnold Drake, Don Heck and Neal Adams. Havok generates powerful “plasma blasts”, an ability he has had difficulty controlling. He is the son of Corsair, the younger brother of the X-Men's Cyclops, and the older brother of Vulcan. He often resents Cyclops' authoritative attitude and reputation as a model X-Man.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Havok.jpg/250px-Havok.jpg
