135.1	Bayes'_theorem	Bayes' theorem	In probability theory and statistics, Bayes's theorem (alternatively Bayes's law or Bayes's rule) is a theorem with two distinct interpretations. In the Bayesian interpretation, it expresses how a subjective degree of belief should rationally change to account for evidence. In the frequentist interpretation, it relates inverse representations of the probabilities concerning two events. In the Bayesian interpretation, Bayes' theorem is fundamental to Bayesian statistics, and has applications in fields including science, engineering, medicine and law. The application of Bayes' theorem to update beliefs is called Bayesian inference.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Bayes%27_Theorem_MMB_01.jpg/220px-Bayes%27_Theorem_MMB_01.jpg
