1.00	Wildlife_trafficking	Wildlife trade	The international wildlife trade is a serious conservation problem, addressed by the United Nations' Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES, which currently has 175 member countries called Parties. The 15th meeting of the Parties took place in Doha, Qatar during 13â€“25 March 2010.. Wildlife trade consists of the trade, barter, or sale of wild specimens of animals and plants. It impacts many thousands of species which may be traded live, whole, or as a wide variety of parts, pieces and derivatives. The great diversity of items and products traded can make it very difficult to identify the species being traded. Species identification poses a significant challenge to authorities when responding to international wildlife trade.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/WildlifeTrade1.JPG/220px-WildlifeTrade1.JPG
