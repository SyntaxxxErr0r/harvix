115.6	GUID_Partition_Table	GUID Partition Table	The widespread MBR partitioning scheme, dating from the early 1980s, imposed limitations which affected the use of modern hardware. Intel therefore developed a new partition-table format in the late 1990s as part of what eventually became UEFI. The GPT as of 2010 forms a subset of the UEFI specification.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/GUID_Partition_Table_Scheme.svg/275px-GUID_Partition_Table_Scheme.svg.png
