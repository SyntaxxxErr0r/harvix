2.00	G5(Apple)	Power Mac G5	The Power Mac G5 is Apple's marketing name for models of the Power Macintosh that contain the IBM PowerPC G5 CPU. The professional-grade computer was the most powerful in Apple's lineup when it was introduced, widely hailed as the first 64-bit PC, and was touted by Apple as the fastest personal computer ever built. It was officially launched as part of Steve Jobs' keynote presentation in June 2003 at the Worldwide Developers Conference, and saw three revisions to the line before being retired in August 2006 to make way for its Intel replacement, the Mac Pro. The Power Mac G5 has an anodized aluminium chassis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Power_Mac_G5_hero_left.jpg/200px-Power_Mac_G5_hero_left.jpg
