71.5	Gasification	Gasification	Gasification is a process that converts organic or fossil based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures (&gt;700Â°C), without combustion, with a controlled amount of oxygen and/or steam. The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from synthesis gas or synthetic gas) or producer gas and is itself a fuel. The power derived from gasification of biomass and combustion of the resultant gas is considered to be a source of renewable energy; the gasification of fossil fuel derived materials such as plastic is not considered to be renewable energy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/El-v-01_ubt.jpeg/220px-El-v-01_ubt.jpeg
