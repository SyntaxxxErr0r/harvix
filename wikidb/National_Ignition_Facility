55.7	National_Ignition_Facility	National Ignition Facility	The National Ignition Facility, or NIF, is a large, laser-based inertial confinement fusion (ICF) research device located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, USA. NIF uses powerful lasers to heat and compress a small amount of hydrogen fuel to the point where nuclear fusion reactions take place. NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, achieving a record 1.875 million joules of ultraviolet laser light to the target chamber on March 15, 2012 . This record shot is an important milestone in NIFâ€™s mission to reach the long-sought goal of "ignition," producing more energy than was put in to start the reaction. Its mission is to achieve fusion with high energy gain, and to support nuclear weapon maintenance and design by studying the behavior of matter under the conditions found within nuclear weapons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/NIF_building_layout.png/400px-NIF_building_layout.png
