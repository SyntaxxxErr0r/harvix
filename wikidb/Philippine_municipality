Municipalities are also called towns (which is actually a better translation of "bayan"). They are distinct from cities, which are a different category of local government unit (LGU). A municipal district is a now-defunct local government unit; previously certain areas were created first as municipal districts before they are created into municipalities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Philippines.svg/150px-Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Philippines.svg.png
