64.0	Cruise_ship	Cruise ship	A cruise ship or cruise liner is a passenger ship used for pleasure voyages, where the voyage itself and the ship's amenities are part of the experience, as well as the different destinations along the way. Transportation is not the prime purpose, as cruise ships operate mostly on routes that return passengers to their originating port, so the ports of call are usually in a specified region of a continent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/MSMajestyOfTheSeasEdit1.JPG/350px-MSMajestyOfTheSeasEdit1.JPG
