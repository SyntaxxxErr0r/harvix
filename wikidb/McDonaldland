69.5	McDonaldland	McDonaldland	McDonaldland was a fantasy world used in the marketing for McDonald's restaurants. It was based on the "total concept and feel" of Sid and Marty Krofft's H.R. Pufnstuf television program. McDonaldland was inhabited by Ronald McDonald and other characters. In addition to being used in advertising, the characters were used as the basis for equipment in the playgrounds attached to some McDonald's. McDonaldland and the supporting characters have been abandoned in their marketing, but Ronald McDonald is still seen in commercials and in Happy Meal toys.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Officer_big_mac_playground.jpg/220px-Officer_big_mac_playground.jpg
