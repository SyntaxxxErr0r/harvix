2.00	Castilla-Leon	Castile and Le贸n	The organic law of Castile and Le贸n, under the Spanish Constitution of 1978, is the region's Statute of Autonomy. The statute lays out the basic laws of the region and defines a series of essential values and symbols of the inhabitants of Castile and Le贸n, such as their linguistic patrimony (the Castilian language, which English speakers commonly refer to simply as Spanish, as well as Leonese and Galician), as well as their historic, artistic, and natural patrimony. Other symbols alluded to are the coat of arms, flag, and banner; there is also allusion to a regional anthem, though as of 2009 none has been adopted. April 23 is designated Castile and Le贸n Day, commemorating the defeat of the comuneros at the Battle of Villalar during the Revolt of the Comuneros, in 1521.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Bandera_de_Castilla_y_Le%C3%B3n.svg/130px-Bandera_de_Castilla_y_Le%C3%B3n.svg.png
