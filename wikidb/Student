114.6	Student	Student	A student is a learner, or someone who attends an educational institution. In some nations, the English term (or its cognate in another language) is reserved for those who attend university, while a schoolchild under the age of eighteen is called a pupil in English (or an equivalent in other languages). In its widest use, student is used for anyone who is learning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Math_lecture_at_TKK.JPG/350px-Math_lecture_at_TKK.JPG
