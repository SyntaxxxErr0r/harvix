103.2	Sprite_(computer_graphics)	Sprite (computer graphics)	In computer graphics, a sprite (also known by other names; see Synonyms below) is a two-dimensional image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene. Initially used to describe graphical objects handled separate from the memory bitmap of a video display, the term has since been applied more loosely to refer to various manner of graphical overlays.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Vg_graphics.svg/100px-Vg_graphics.svg.png
