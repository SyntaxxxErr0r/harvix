89.5	Geek_Pride_Day	Geek Pride Day	Geek Pride Day is an initiative to promote geek culture, celebrated on 25 May. The date was chosen as to commemorate the release of the first Star Wars film, A New Hope on 25 May 1977 (see Star Wars Day), but shares the same day as two other similar fan "holidays": Towel Day, for fans of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy trilogy by Douglas Adams, and the Glorious 25 May for fans of Terry Pratchett's Discworld.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Friki.jpg/225px-Friki.jpg
