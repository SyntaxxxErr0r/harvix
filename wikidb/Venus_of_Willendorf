It was discovered in 1908 by archaeologist Josef Szombathy at a paleolithic site near Willendorf, a village in Lower Austria near the city of Krems. It is carved from an oolitic limestone that is not local to the area, and tinted with red ochre. The "Venus of Willendorf" is now in the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Venus_von_Willendorf_01.jpg/200px-Venus_von_Willendorf_01.jpg
