55.8	Greedy_algorithm	Greedy algorithm	A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. On some problems, a greedy strategy need not produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Greedy_algorithm_36_cents.svg/280px-Greedy_algorithm_36_cents.svg.png
