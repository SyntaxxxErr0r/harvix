73.8	Creatine	Creatine	Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid that occurs naturally in vertebrates and helps to supply energy to all cells in the body, primarily muscle. This is achieved by increasing the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Creatine was identified in 1832 when Michel Eugène Chevreul discovered it as a component of skeletal muscle, which he later named after the Greek word for meat, κρέας . In solution, creatine is in equilibrium with creatinine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Creatine2.png/121px-Creatine2.png
