2.00	A_Journey_Through_Fairyland	A Journey Through Fairyland	A Journey Through Fairyland (aka Yousei Furorensu or Fairy Florence 妖精フローレンス) is a 90-minute 1985 Japanese animated film by Sanrio, the company which animated "Unico", "Legend of Sirius" and "Ringing Bell", though this story is less sought out as a rarity among Sanrio cult classic collectors. It is also Sanrio's final feature-length anime film until 2007. It was brought to America in 1995 through a company called Celebrity Home Ent. Unlike previous works, this one mainly focuses on music more than plot, prompting it to be compared with Disney's older work "Fantasia" (Video Business review). The one original piece is "My Name is Florence," which contains lyrics and is sung in the film; all other songs on the soundtrack are works of classical composition, written by Beethoven and other similarly noteworthy composers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/09/A_Journey_Through_Fairyland_VideoCover.jpg/220px-A_Journey_Through_Fairyland_VideoCover.jpg
