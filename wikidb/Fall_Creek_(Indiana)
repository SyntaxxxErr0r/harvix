2.00	Fall_Creek_(Indiana)	Fall Creek (Indiana)	Fall Creek begins near the town of Honey Creek, Indiana. Initially, it flows north, and crosses just into Delaware County, near Bell Creek, another tributary of the White River that joins the West Fork near Yorktown. Here, Fall Creek turns sharply to the southwest, crossing near Middletown. Tributaries in Henry County include Honey Creek and Sugar Creek.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Fall_Creek_Massacre_-_marker.jpg/220px-Fall_Creek_Massacre_-_marker.jpg
