73.0	Brewing	Brewing	Brewing is the production of beer through steeping a starch source (commonly cereal grains) in water and then fermenting with yeast. Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that this technique was used in ancient Egypt. Descriptions of various beer recipes can be found in Sumerian writings, some of the oldest known writing of any sort. Brewing takes place in a brewery by a brewer, and the brewing industry is part of most western economies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/The_Brewer_designed_and_engraved_in_the_Sixteenth._Century_by_J_Amman.png/220px-The_Brewer_designed_and_engraved_in_the_Sixteenth._Century_by_J_Amman.png
