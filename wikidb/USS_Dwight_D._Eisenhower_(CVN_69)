1.00	USS_Dwight_D._Eisenhower_(CVN_69)	USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69)	USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) ("Ike") is an aircraft carrier currently in service with the United States Navy. Commissioned in 1977, the ship is the second of the ten Nimitz-class supercarriers currently in service, and is the first ship named after the thirty-fourth President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower. The vessel was initially named simply as USS Eisenhower, much like the lead ship of the class Nimitz, but the name was changed to its present form on 25 May 1970. The carrier, like all others of her class, was constructed at Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Virginia, with the same design as the lead ship, although the ship has been overhauled twice to bring her up to the standards of those constructed more recently.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Uss_Dwight_D._Eisenhower_%28CVN_69%29.jpg/300px-Uss_Dwight_D._Eisenhower_%28CVN_69%29.jpg
