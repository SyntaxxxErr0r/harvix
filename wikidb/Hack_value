15.00	Hack_value	Hacker (programmer subculture)	A hacker is an adherent of the computer programmer subculture that originally emerged in academia in the 1960s, in particular around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) and MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Hackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call "crackers", that is, those who are generally meant when media and the general public people use the term "hacker", and whose primary focus, be it for malicious or beneficial reasons, are weaknesses in computer security .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Glider.svg/220px-Glider.svg.png
