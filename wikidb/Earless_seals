1.00	Earless_seals	Earless seal	The true seals or earless seals are one of the three main groups of mammals within the seal superfamily, Pinnipedia. All true seals are members of the family Phocidae ( ). They are sometimes called crawling seals to distinguish them from the fur seals and sea lions of the family Otariidae. Seals live in the oceans of both hemispheres and are mostly confined to polar, subpolar, and temperate climates, with the exception of the more tropical monk seals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Seehund.jpg/220px-Seehund.jpg
