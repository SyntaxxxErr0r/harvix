1.00	Pervo_Devo	Pervo Devo	Pervo Devo is a 1991 EP by the punk rock band Screeching Weasel. It consists of songs that were recorded for My Brain Hurts but were left off the album. The EP was originally included with the final issue of "Teen Punks in Heat", a sex-themed 'zine penned by Ben Weasel. There were two pressing of the record. Between the two pressings, the record label changed its name from "Shred of Dignity" to "Outpunk". All of the songs resurfaced on the band's B-sides album Kill the Musicians, though the spoken intro to "I Wanna Be A Homosexual" by Bruce LaBruce appears only on this 7".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Pervodevo.jpg/220px-Pervodevo.jpg
