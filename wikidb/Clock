62.0	Clock	Clock	A clock is an instrument used to indicate, keep, and co-ordinate time. The word clock is derived ultimately (via Dutch, Northern French, and Medieval Latin) from the Celtic words clagan and clocca meaning "bell". A silent instrument missing such a mechanism has traditionally been known as a timepiece. In general usage today a "clock" refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time. Watches and other timepieces that can be carried on one's person are often distinguished from clocks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Greenwich_clock.jpg/220px-Greenwich_clock.jpg
