2.20	BIOS_Boot_Specification	BIOS	In IBM PC compatible computers, the basic input/output system (BIOS), also known as the System BIOS or ROM BIOS ( ), is a de facto standard defining a firmware interface. The name originated in earlier computers running CP/M and other operating systems, where the BIOS was loaded from disc rather than stored as firmware (EPROMs were not yet available).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/AwardBIOS_CMOS_Setup_Utility.png/220px-AwardBIOS_CMOS_Setup_Utility.png
