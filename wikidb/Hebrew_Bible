84.2	Hebrew_Bible	Hebrew Bible	The Hebrew Bible (Latin Biblia Hebraica, also Hebrew Scriptures, Jewish Bible) is a term used by biblical scholars to refer to the Tanakh (Hebrew: â€Ž), a canonical collection of Jewish texts, and the common textual source of the several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. These texts are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (about half of the Book of Daniel, some parts of the Book of Ezra and a few others).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Targum.jpg/220px-Targum.jpg
