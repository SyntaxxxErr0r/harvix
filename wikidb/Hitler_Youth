98.1	Hitler_Youth	Hitler Youth	The HJ was organized into corps under adult leaders, and the general membership comprised boys aged fourteen to eighteen. The HJ was also seen as an important stepping stone to future membership of the elite Schutzstaffel (the SS). Members of the HJ were particularly proud to be bestowed with the single Sig Rune (victory symbol) by the SS. The SS utilized two Sig Runes as their mark, and this gesture served to symbolically link the two groups.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Hitlerjugend.svg/100px-Hitlerjugend.svg.png
