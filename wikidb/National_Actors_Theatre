He was chairman until his death in 2004. At first the company was housed at the Belasco Theatre, New York, then at the nearby Lyceum Theatre, and in 2002 was based in the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University in New York City. It was the only professional theatre company housed in a university in New York City.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/Rightyouare.jpg/400px-Rightyouare.jpg
