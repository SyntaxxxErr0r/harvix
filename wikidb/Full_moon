85.5	Full_moon	Full moon	Full moon is a lunar phase that occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun. More precisely, a full moon occurs when the geocentric apparent longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180 degrees; the Moon is then in opposition with the Sun.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/200px-FullMoon2010.jpg
