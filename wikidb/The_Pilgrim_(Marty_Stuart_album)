2.10	The_Pilgrim_(Marty_Stuart_album)	The Pilgrim (Marty Stuart album)	The Pilgrim is the eleventh studio album of country music artist Marty Stuart. It is a concept album, telling the story of a man (The Pilgrim) from Marty Stuart's hometown of Philadelphia, Mississippi. Marty plays the role of the Pilgrim, as well as other roles. It was a significant move in Stuart's career, as before The Pilgrim he had been focusing more on trying to get a hit song instead of making the music that really mattered to him. With this album he demonstrates his songwriting skills (every track was written by Stuart) and his diverse instrumental skills. The album has many legendary country/bluegrass legends as guest stars, such as Emmylou Harris, Pam Tillis, George Jones, Ralph Stanley, Earl Scruggs and Marty's old boss, Johnny Cash.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Marty_Stuart_-_The_Pilgrim.jpg/220px-Marty_Stuart_-_The_Pilgrim.jpg
