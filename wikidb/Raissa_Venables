1.00	Raissa_Venables	Raissa Venables	The photographs of New Yorker Raїssa Venables portray distorted rooms with intoxicating colours in a surreal manner. Despite the absence of people in her photographs, we still feel their souls in the rooms. Although her work is contemporary, involving the engagement of the latest technology, Venables is influenced by important artistic innovations in history. This includes the usage of perspectives and colours of the classical Renaissance, the Expressionist exploration of the relationship between colours and emotions, and the Cubist experimentation of depicting an object in multiple viewpoints on canvas. The result is a mesmerizing impact Venables’s photographs have on us the viewers, allowing us to imagine the dreams, nightmares, and events that took place in those spaces.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Red_Stairs_ddvertig.jpg/220px-Red_Stairs_ddvertig.jpg
