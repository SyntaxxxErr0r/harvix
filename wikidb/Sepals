20.11	Sepals	Sepal	A sepal (from Latin separatus "separate" + petalum "petal" ) is a part of the flower of angiosperms (flowering plants). Collectively the sepals form the calyx, which is the outermost whorl of parts that form a flower. Usually green, sepals have the typical function of protecting the petals when the flower is in bud. Another common function of sepals is protection from insect attack, and when there is no such protection, there often is some other ecological strategy, such as poison.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Petal-sepal.jpg/220px-Petal-sepal.jpg
