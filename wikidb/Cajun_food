3.21	Cajun_food	Cajun cuisine	Cajun cuisine (French: ) is the style of cooking named for the French-speaking Acadian or "Cajun" immigrants deported by the British from Acadia in Canada to the Acadiana region of Louisiana, USA. It is what could be called a rustic cuisine â€” locally available ingredients predominate, and preparation is simple. An authentic Cajun meal is usually a three-pot affair, with one pot dedicated to the main dish, one dedicated to steamed rice, special made sausages, or some other seafood dish, and the third containing whatever vegetable is plentiful or available. Ground Cayenne &amp; Fresh Black Pepper are used often.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Crownburger2.jpg/175px-Crownburger2.jpg
