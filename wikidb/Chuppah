58.8	Chuppah	Chuppah	A chuppah (Hebrew: ‎, pl. חוּפּוֹת, chuppot, literally, "canopy" or "covering"), also huppah, chupah, or chuppa, is a canopy under which a Jewish couple stand during their wedding ceremony. It consists of a cloth or sheet, sometimes a tallit, stretched or supported over four poles, or sometimes manually held up by attendants to the ceremony. A chuppah symbolizes the home that the couple will build together. While a Jewish marriage is still considered valid in the absence of a chuppah, a chuppah is still considered a basic requirement for a Jewish wedding.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Chupah_closeup.JPG/220px-Chupah_closeup.JPG
