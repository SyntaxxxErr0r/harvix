59.6	Application-specific_integrated_circuit	Application-specific integrated circuit	An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is an integrated circuit (IC) customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use. For example, a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder is an ASIC. Application-specific standard products (ASSPs) are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the 7400 or the 4000 series.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/SSDTR-ASIC_technology.jpg/220px-SSDTR-ASIC_technology.jpg
