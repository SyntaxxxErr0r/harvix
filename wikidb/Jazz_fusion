85.9	Jazz_fusion	Jazz fusion	Jazz fusion, fusion, or jazz-rock is a musical fusion genre that developed from mixing funk and R&amp;B rhythms and the amplification and electronic effects of rock music, complex time signatures derived from non-Western music and extended, typically instrumental compositions with a jazz approach to lengthy group improvisations, often using wind and brass and displaying a high level of instrumental technique. The term "jazz rock" is often used as a synonym for "jazz fusion" as well as for music performed by late 1960s and 1970s-era rock bands that added jazz elements to their music. Some progressive rock is also labelled "fusion".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Miles_Davis_24.jpg/300px-Miles_Davis_24.jpg
