13.01	Cordless_phone	Cordless telephone	A cordless telephone or portable telephone is a telephone with a wireless handset that communicates via radio waves with a base station connected to a fixed telephone line, usually within a limited range of its base station (which has the handset cradle). The base station is on the subscriber premises, and attaches to the telephone network the same way a corded telephone does.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Phone.svg/195px-Phone.svg.png
