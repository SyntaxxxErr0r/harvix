8.62	French_Revolutionary_Army	French Revolutionary Army	The French Revolutionary Army is the term used to refer to the military of France during the period between the fall of the ancien regime under Louis XVI in 1792 and the formation of the First French Empire under Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804. These armies were characterised by their revolutionary fervour and their poor equipment. They performed with mixed results, from the early disastrous defeats to the amazing victories under Generals Moreau, Mass√©na and Bonaparte.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Bataille_Jemmapes.jpg/300px-Bataille_Jemmapes.jpg
