115.4	Religious_Society_of_Friends	Quakers	Quakers, or Friends, are members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Friends' Church, an international religious movement which focusses on the priesthood of all believers. Most Quakers regard themselves as Christians, and include those with evangelical, holiness, liberal and traditional Quaker understandings of Christianity. There are also two distinct groups of Friends who emerged in the late twentieth century known as nontheist Friends and universalist Friends who do not regard themselves as Christian.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Quaker_star-T.svg/150px-Quaker_star-T.svg.png
