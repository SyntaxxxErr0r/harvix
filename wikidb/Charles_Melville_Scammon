1.00	Charles_Melville_Scammon	Charles Melville Scammon	Charles Melville Scammon (1825-1911) was a 19th-century whaleman, naturalist, and author. He was the first to hunt the gray whales of both Laguna Ojo de Liebre and San Ignacio Lagoon, the former once being called "Scammon's Lagoon" after him. In 1874 he wrote the book The Marine Mammals of the North-western Coast of North America, which was a financial failure. It is now considered a classic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Capt._Charles_M_Scammon%2C_Scientist_Overland_Monthly.JPG/175px-Capt._Charles_M_Scammon%2C_Scientist_Overland_Monthly.JPG
