263.1	Six_degrees_of_separation	Six degrees of separation	Six degrees of separation refers to the idea that everyone is on average approximately six steps away, by way of introduction, from any other person on Earth, so that a chain of, "a friend of a friend" statements can be made, on average, to connect any two people in six steps or fewer. It was originally set out by Frigyes Karinthy and popularized by a play written by John Guare.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Six_degrees_of_separation.svg/250px-Six_degrees_of_separation.svg.png
