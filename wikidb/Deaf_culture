55.0	Deaf_culture	Deaf culture	Historically, Deaf culture has often been acquired within schools for the deaf and within Deaf social clubs, both of which unite deaf people into communities with which they can identify. Becoming Deaf culturally can occur at different times for different people, depending on the circumstances of one's life. A small proportion of deaf individuals acquire sign language and Deaf culture in infancy from Deaf parents, others acquire it through attendance at schools, and yet others may not be exposed to sign language and Deaf culture until college or a time after that.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/MoreAustinandWashingtonBrazos_127.JPG/220px-MoreAustinandWashingtonBrazos_127.JPG
