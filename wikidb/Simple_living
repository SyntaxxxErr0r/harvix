70.8	Simple_living	Simple living	Simple living encompasses a number of different voluntary practices to simplify one's lifestyle. These may include reducing one's possessions or increasing self-sufficiency, for example. Simple living may be characterized by individuals being satisfied with what they need rather than want. Although asceticism generally promotes living simply and refraining from luxury and indulgence, not all proponents of simple living are ascetics. Simple living is distinct from those living in forced poverty, as it is a voluntary lifestyle choice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Gandhi_spinning_1942.jpg/220px-Gandhi_spinning_1942.jpg
