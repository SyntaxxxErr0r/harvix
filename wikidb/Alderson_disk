16.02	Alderson_disk	Alderson disk	An Alderson disk (named after Dan Alderson, its originator) is an artificial astronomical megastructure, like Niven's Ringworld, or a Dyson sphere. The disk is a giant platter with a thickness of several thousand miles. The sun rests in the hole at the center of the disk. The outer radius of an Alderson disk would be roughly equivalent to the orbit of Mars or Jupiter. According to the proposal, a sufficiently massive disk would have a larger mass than its sun.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Alderson_disk.svg/260px-Alderson_disk.svg.png
