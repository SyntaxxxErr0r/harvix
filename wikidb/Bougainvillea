51.3	Bougainvillea	Bougainvillea	Bougainvillea ( ) is a genus of flowering plants native to South America from Brazil west to Peru and south to southern Argentina . Different authors accept between four and 18 species in the genus. The plant was first described by Philibert Commerçon, a French botanist accompanying French Navy admiral and explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville during his voyage of circumnavigation, and first published for him by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789. It is possible that the plants were first discovered by Jeanne Baré, Commerçon's lover and assistant whom he snuck on board (despite regulations) disguised as a man (and who thus became the first woman to circumnavigate the globe).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Bougainvillea_spectabilis3.jpg/220px-Bougainvillea_spectabilis3.jpg
