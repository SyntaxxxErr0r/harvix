74.3	Moondog	Moondog	Moondog, born Louis Thomas Hardin (May 26, 1916 â€“ September 8, 1999), was a blind American composer, musician, poet and inventor of several musical instruments. Moving to New York as a young man, Moondog made a deliberate decision to make his home on the streets there, where he spent approximately twenty of the thirty years he lived in the city. Most days he could be found in his chosen part of town wearing clothes he had created based on his own interpretation of the Norse god Thor. Thanks to his unconventional outfits and lifestyle, he was known for much of his life as "The Viking of 6th Avenue".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/Moondog.jpg
