1.00	Ethynyl_radical	Ethynyl radical	The ethynyl radical, with chemical formula C2H, is an abundant interstellar polyatomic molecule that does not occur naturally on Earth. It was first observed by electron spin resonance isolated in a solid argon matrix at liquid helium temperatures in 1963 by Cochran and coworkers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. It was first observed in the gas phase by Tucker and coworkers in November 1973 toward the Orion Nebula, using the NRAO 11m radio telescope. It has since been detected in a large variety of interstellar environments, including dense molecular clouds, bok globules, star forming regions, the shells around carbon-rich evolved stars, and even in other galaxies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Ethynyl-radical-2D.png/121px-Ethynyl-radical-2D.png
