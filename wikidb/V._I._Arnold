While he is best known for the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem regarding the stability of integrable Hamiltonian systems, he made important contributions in several areas including dynamical systems theory, catastrophe theory, topology, algebraic geometry, classical mechanics and singularity theory, including posing the ADE classification problem, since his first main result—the partial solution of Hilbert's thirteenth problem in 1957 at the age of 19.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Vladimir_Arnold-1.jpg/200px-Vladimir_Arnold-1.jpg
