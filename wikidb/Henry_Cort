4.12	Henry_Cort	Henry Cort	With an increase in demand for iron goods from the Royal Navy, the ironworking enterprise in Middle Street, Gosport flourished, but was strained by a 1779 contract for re-rolling barrel hoops for the Navy Vitualling Board. To cope with this, Cort set up an iron works in Fontley, Hampshire. This was a rolling mill, and here he developed his ideas, leading to patents in 1783 for the grooved rolling mill and 1784 for his balling or puddling furnace, allowing the manufacture of crude, standardized shapes. His work built on the existing ideas of the Cranege brothers and their reverberatory furnace (where the heat is applied from above, rather than forced air from below) and Peter Onions' puddling process where the iron is stirred to separate out impurities and extract the higher quality wrought iron. The furnace effectively lowers the carbon content of the cast iron charge by oxidation. The "puddler" extracts a mass of iron from the furnace using a rabbling bar. The extracted ball of metal is then processed into a shingle by a shingling hammer, after which it is rolled in a rolling mill.'''Italic text]]	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Puddling_furnace.jpg/250px-Puddling_furnace.jpg
