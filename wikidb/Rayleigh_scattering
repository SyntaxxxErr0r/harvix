88.7	Rayleigh_scattering	Rayleigh scattering	Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, is the elastic scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light. The particles may be individual atoms or molecules. It can occur when light travels through transparent solids and liquids, but is most prominently seen in gases. Rayleigh scattering is a function of the electric polarizability of the particles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/The_Coorong_South_Australia.jpg/220px-The_Coorong_South_Australia.jpg
