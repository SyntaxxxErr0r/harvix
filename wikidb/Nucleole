3.00	Nucleole	Nucleolus	The nucleolus (plural nucleoli) is a non-membrane bound structure composed of proteins and nucleic acids found within the nucleus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed and assembled within the nucleolus. The nucleolus ultrastructure can be visualized through an electron microscope, while the organization and dynamics can be studied through fluorescent protein tagging and fluorescent recovery after photobleaching . Malfunction of nucleoli can be the cause for several human diseases. It takes up to about 25% of the nuclear volume.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Diagram_human_cell_nucleus.svg/300px-Diagram_human_cell_nucleus.svg.png
