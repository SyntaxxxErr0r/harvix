The station has a net electrical output of 1,190 megawatts, which is 2% of Great Britain's peak electricity demand of 60 GW. Electricity is produced through the use of two advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR). Hartlepool was only the third nuclear power station in the United Kingdom to use AGR technology. Hartlepool power station was also the first power station to be built as close to a major urban area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Hartlepool_Power_Station_-_geograph.org.uk_-_832048.jpg/220px-Hartlepool_Power_Station_-_geograph.org.uk_-_832048.jpg
