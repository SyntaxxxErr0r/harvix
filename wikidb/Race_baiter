1.03	Race_baiter	Racism	Racism is the belief that inherent different traits in human racial groups justify discrimination. In the modern English language, the term "racism" is used predominantly as a pejorative epithet. It is applied especially to the practice or advocacy of racial discrimination of a pernicious nature (i.e., which harms particular groups of people), and which is often justified by recourse to racial stereotyping or pseudo-science. Racism is popularly associated with various activities that are illegal or commonly considered harmful, such as extremism, hatred, xenophobia, , genocide denial, vigilantism (hate crimes, terrorism), etc.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Bank_of_America_wordmark.svg/220px-Bank_of_America_wordmark.svg.png
