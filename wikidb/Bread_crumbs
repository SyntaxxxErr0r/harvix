18.66	Bread_crumbs	Bread crumbs	Breadcrumbs or bread crumbs (regional variants: breading, crispies) are small particles of dry bread, which are used for breading or crumbing foods, topping casseroles, stuffing poultry, thickening stews, and adding inexpensive bulk to meatloaves and similar foods. They are documented in cookbooks as early as 1716. They are not to be confused with croutons; though both are made of dried bread, croutons are approximately cubic pieces averaging a cubic centimeter in size and breadcrumbs are roughly the same size and shape as a small pebble. Both probably originated as a way to use stale bread and unwanted crust.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Breadcrumb.jpg/220px-Breadcrumb.jpg
