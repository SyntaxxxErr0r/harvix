88.0	HTML_editor	HTML editor	An HTML editor is a software application for creating web pages. Although the HTML markup of a web page can be written with any text editor, specialized HTML editors can offer convenience and added functionality. For example, many HTML editors work not only with HTML, but also with related technologies such as CSS, XML and JavaScript or ECMAScript. In some cases they also manage communication with remote web servers via FTP and WebDAV, and version management systems such as CVS or Subversion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/W3c_amaya_10_fullmode_enwiki_xfce4therapy.png/250px-W3c_amaya_10_fullmode_enwiki_xfce4therapy.png
