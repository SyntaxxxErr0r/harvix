2.00	Canarian_Egyptian_Vulture	Egyptian Vulture	The Egyptian Vulture is a small Old World vulture, found widely distributed from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. It is the only living member of the genus Neophron. It has sometimes also been known as the White Scavenger Vulture or Pharaoh's Chicken. Like other vultures it soars on thermals and the underwing black and white pattern and wedge tail make it distinctive. It sometimes uses stones to break the eggs of birds making it one of the few birds that make use of tools. Birds that breed in the temperate region migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th Century and some isolated island forms are particularly endangered.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Egyptian_vulture.jpg/220px-Egyptian_vulture.jpg
