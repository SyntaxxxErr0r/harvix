1.01	Gally	List of Battle Angel Alita characters	Jashugan's unnamed master is an old cyborg who resides in an automobile junkyard. Jashugan visits him before his challenge race with Alita, and faces his master in a test of his ability to manipulate chi. The old cyborg succumbs to Jashugan's mastery of reflective resonance, an ability to match an opponent's chi and inflict a destructive vibratory feedback upon them, that leaves him mortally wounded. He views cyborgs as more machines than human, believing that they do not need love, nor should they fear death, advising Jashugan to kill Shumira as she is the cause of his self-doubt.
