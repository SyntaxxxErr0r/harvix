62.6	Arson	Arson	Arson (or 'fire-raising', as it is known in Scotland) is the crime of intentionally or maliciously lighting structures, wildland areas, cars or other property on fire. It may be distinguished from other causes such as spontaneous combustion and natural wildfires. Arson often involves fires deliberately set to the property of another or to one's own property as to collect insurance compensation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Skyline_Parkway_Motel_Burned.jpg/280px-Skyline_Parkway_Motel_Burned.jpg
