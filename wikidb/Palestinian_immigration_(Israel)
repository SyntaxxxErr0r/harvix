1.10	Palestinian_immigration_(Israel)	Palestinian immigration (Israel)	Palestinian immigration refers to the movement of Palestinians into the territory of Israel. Since 1948, most Palestinians crossing into Israel have come to live, reside and/or work, some of them continuing the lives they lived prior to their displacement in the Palestinian exodus. Others have crossed to engage in acts of violence and sabotage against Israelis and Israel, as well as apolitical crime. The Israeli government has tightly restricted legal immigration and resettlement of Palestinian refugees within its boundaries, and consistently opposed their claim to Right of Return.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Infiltrator_1954.jpg/220px-Infiltrator_1954.jpg
