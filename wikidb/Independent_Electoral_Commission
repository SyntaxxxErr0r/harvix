The exact name used varies from country to country, including such terms as "electoral commission", "central election commission", "electoral branch" or "electoral court". Election commissions can be independent, mixed, judicial or governmental. They may also be responsible for electoral boundary delimitation. In federations there may be a separate body for each subnational government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Tangipahoa_Parish_Board_of_Election_Supervisors_2010_December_03-2.JPG/220px-Tangipahoa_Parish_Board_of_Election_Supervisors_2010_December_03-2.JPG
