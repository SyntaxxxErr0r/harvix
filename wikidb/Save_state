1.00	Save_state	Saved game	A saved game (also sometimes called a game save, savegame, or savefile) is a piece of digitally stored information about the progress of a player in an electronic game (like a video game). This saved game can be reloaded later, so the player can continue where he or she had stopped. Players usually save games to prevent the loss of progress in the game (as might happen after a game over unless the game features permadeath, in which the save file is permanently deleted), especially when interrupting or ending a game session.
