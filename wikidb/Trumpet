104.8	Trumpet	Trumpet	The trumpet is the musical instrument with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpets are among the oldest musical instruments, dating back to at least 1500 BC. They are played by blowing air through closed lips, producing a "buzzing" sound which starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded oblong shape.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Trumpet_1.jpg/250px-Trumpet_1.jpg
