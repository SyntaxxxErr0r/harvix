The team played five home games at Razorback Stadium and two home games at War Memorial Stadium. Coach Bobby Petrino was in his third year with the Razorbacks. They were members of the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference. The Razorbacks finished the season 10–2, 6–2 in SEC play and earned a berth in the Sugar Bowl, their first major bowl appearance in two decades, where they were defeated by Ohio State 26–31. However, Ohio State later vacated all of their 2010 season victories due to an NCAA violation involving improper benefits to some of their players.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Arkansas_text_logo.svg/150px-Arkansas_text_logo.svg.png
