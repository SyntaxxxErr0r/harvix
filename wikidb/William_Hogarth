72.3	William_Hogarth	William Hogarth	William Hogarth (10 November 1697 â€“ 26 October 1764) was an English painter, printmaker, pictorial satirist, social critic and editorial cartoonist who has been credited with pioneering western sequential art. His work ranged from realistic portraiture to comic strip-like series of pictures called "modern moral subjects". Knowledge of his work is so pervasive that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as "Hogarthian."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/William_Hogarth_006.jpg/220px-William_Hogarth_006.jpg
