81.8	Archaea	Archaea	In the past they had been classed with bacteria as prokaryotes (or Kingdom Monera) and named archaebacteria, but this classification is regarded as outdated. In fact, the Archaea have an independent evolutionary history and show many differences in their biochemistry from other forms of life, and so they are now classified as a separate domain in the three-domain system. In this system, the phylogenetically distinct branches of evolutionary descent are the Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Halobacteria.jpg/200px-Halobacteria.jpg
