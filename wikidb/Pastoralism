53.6	Pastoralism	Pastoralism	Pastoralism or pastoral farming is the branch of agriculture concerned with the raising of livestock. It is animal husbandry: the care, tending and use of animals such as camels, goats, cattle, yaks, llamas, and sheep. It may have a mobile aspect, moving the herds in search of fresh pasture and water. Pastoralists use resources effectively which ensure the biodiversity of the savannas and prevent them from evolving into scrubland. Pastoralists graze their animals and use fire to improve pastures. For the Turkana, the use of fire has prevented the invasion of the savanna by woody species. Biomass of the domesticated and wild animals was increased by a higher quality of grass. Pastoralist adapt well to the environment. Pastoralists and their animals gather when rain water is abundant and the pasture is rich; however, they scatter during the drying of the savanna. Pastoralism is a successful strategy to support a population with the limited resources of the land.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Nomadic_Camping_%28266139768%29.jpg/220px-Nomadic_Camping_%28266139768%29.jpg
