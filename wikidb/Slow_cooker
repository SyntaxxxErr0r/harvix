51.2	Slow_cooker	Slow cooker	A slow cooker, also known as a Crock-Pot or Slo-Cooker (trademarks that are often used generically in the US-Canada and UK, respectively), is a countertop electrical cooking appliance that is used for simmering, which requires maintaining a relatively low temperature compared to other cooking methods (such as baking, boiling, and frying) for many hours, allowing unattended cooking of pot roast, stew, and other suitable dishes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Crock_pot_parts.jpg/200px-Crock_pot_parts.jpg
