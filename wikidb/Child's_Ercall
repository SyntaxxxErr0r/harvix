1.10	Child's_Ercall	Child's Ercall	Its name is thought to derive from a Celtic word, perhaps the old Welsh name Ercal, along with "child" in its mediaeval sense, meaning "knight". The parish is sometimes referred to as Ercall Parva, which turned into "Little Ercall". This name saved it from confusion with the other Ercall in Shropshire - Ercall Magna, now called "High Ercall". The change from use of the names Ercall Magna and Ercall Parva to High Ercall and Little and later Child's Ercall, pbetter suggests that the use of the term "Child's" merely alludes to it being 'Little' like a child, compared to the 'adult' High(er) Ercall, rather than any link to a term for a young knight.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/St_Michael%27s_Church_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1107875.jpg/240px-St_Michael%27s_Church_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1107875.jpg
