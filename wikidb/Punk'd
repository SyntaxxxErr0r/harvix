62.9	Punk'd	Punk'd	Punk'd is an American hidden camera-practical joke reality television series that first aired on MTV in 2003 and was created by Ashton Kutcher and Jason Goldberg, and produced and hosted by Ashton Kutcher. It bore a resemblance to both the classic hidden camera show Candid Camera and to TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes, which also featured pranks on celebrities. Being "punk'd" referred to being the victim of such a prank.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/Punk%27d_revived_logo.jpg/250px-Punk%27d_revived_logo.jpg
