In 2006 he was convicted of multiple federal felony charges relating to Enron's financial collapse, and is currently serving a 24-year, four-month prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Englewood, Colorado. The Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments in the appeal of the case March 1, 2010. On June 24, 2010, the Supreme Court vacated part of Skilling's conviction and sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. In April, 2011 a three judge 5th Circuit Court panel ruled that the verdict would have been the same despite the legal issues under discussion, and Skilling's conviction was upheld . Skilling has once again appealed this new decision to the Supreme Court.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Jeffrey_Skilling_mug_shot.jpg/220px-Jeffrey_Skilling_mug_shot.jpg
