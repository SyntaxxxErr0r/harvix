It includes major collections of Caravaggio, Raphael, and Titian, and of ancient Roman art. The Borghese also bought widely from leading painters and sculptors of his day, and Scipione Borghese's commissions include two portrait busts by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Most of the collection remains intact and on display at the Galleria Borghese, although a significant sale of classical sculpture was made under duress to the Louvre in 1807.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/ApolloAndDaphne.JPG/200px-ApolloAndDaphne.JPG
