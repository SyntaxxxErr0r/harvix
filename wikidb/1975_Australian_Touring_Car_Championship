It began at Symmons Plains and ended at Lakeside International Raceway after seven rounds. One of the most controversial series in history saw Allan Grice disqualified from Surfers Paradise round for a technical infringement while leading the series, before racing under appeal and being disqualified again after the appeal failed. Reigning champion Peter Brock parted company with the Holden Dealer Team before the series began and raced in a privately funded Holden Torana during the season. The Holden Dealer Team retained the drivers title through Colin Bond whose Holden Torana SL/R 5000 L34 took victories at the opening round at Symmons Plains Raceway, then an end of season surge at Adelaide International Raceway and Lakeside International Raceway saw Bond vault past Grice and Bob Morris. Two litre class competitor Christine Gibson driving a factory supported Alfa Romeo GTV led the series mid-season after taking four class wins, but had disqualification problems of her own and the V8 Holden regained the advantage by season's end. Gibson's effort however remains tgo this day the best performance by a woman in Australian Touring Car Championship history.
