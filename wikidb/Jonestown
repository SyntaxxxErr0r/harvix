253.9	Jonestown	Jonestown	Jonestown was the informal name for the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, an intentional community in northwestern Guyana formed by the Peoples Temple led by Jim Jones. It became internationally notorious when, on November 18, 1978, 918 people died in the settlement as well as in a nearby airstrip and in Georgetown, Guyana's capital. The name of the settlement became synonymous with the incidents at those locations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Guyana_location_map.svg/200px-Guyana_location_map.svg.png
