74.0	Mikhail_Bakunin	Mikhail Bakunin	Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin (Russian: ; IPA: ; 30 May 1814 â€“ 1 July 1876) was a well-known Russian revolutionary and theorist of collectivist anarchism. He has also often been called the father of anarchist theory in general. Bakunin grew up near Moscow, where he moved to study philosophy and began to read the French Encyclopedists, leading to enthusiasm for the philosophy of Fichte. From Fichte, Bakunin went on to immerse himself in the works of Hegel, the most influential thinker among German intellectuals at the time. That led to his wholehearted embrace of Hegelianism, as he became bedazzled by Hegel's famous maxim; "Everything that exists is rational". In 1840 Bakunin traveled to St. Petersburg and Berlin, preparing himself for a professorship in philosophy or history at the University of Moscow.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Bakunin.png/220px-Bakunin.png
