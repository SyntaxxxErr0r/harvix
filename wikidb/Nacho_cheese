In Mexico itself they are rather called "totopos". In their simplest form, nachos are tortilla chips (totopos) covered in nacho cheese or shredded cheese and salsa or sometimes french fries, potato chips or popcorn is used instead of tortilla chips. First created circa 1943 by Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya, the original nachos consisted of fried corn tortillas covered with melted cheddar cheese and pickled jalape√±o peppers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Nachos-cheese.jpg/200px-Nachos-cheese.jpg
