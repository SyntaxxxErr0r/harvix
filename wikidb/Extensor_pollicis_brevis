3.00	Extensor_pollicis_brevis	Hand	A hand (med./lat.: manus, pl. manÅ«s) is a prehensile, multi-fingered extremity located at the end of an arm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each "hand" and fingerprints remarkably similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having either "hands" or "paws" on their front limbs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Lefthand0.jpg/120px-Lefthand0.jpg
