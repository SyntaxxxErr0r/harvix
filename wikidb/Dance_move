13.30	Dance_move	Dance move	Dance moves or dance steps are the building blocks of many dances. More complex dance moves are called dance patterns, dance figures,dance movements, or dance variations. They are usually isolated, defined, and organized so that beginning dancers can learn and use them independently of each other. Dance moves tend to emphasize the concepts of lead and follow and connection. In most cases dance moves by themselves are independent of musicality, which is the appropriateness of a move to the music (for a notable exception, see Bharatanatyam). Generally, they are memorized in sets of eight counts.
