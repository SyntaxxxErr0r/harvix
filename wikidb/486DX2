2.00	486DX2	Intel 80486DX2	The Intel 80486DX2 (later rebadged i486DX2) is a CPU produced by Intel that was introduced in 1992. The i486DX2 was nearly identical to the i486DX but for the addition of clock multiplier circuitry. It was the first chip to use clock doubling, whereby the processor runs two internal logic clock cycles per external bus cycle. A i486 DX2 was thus significantly faster than an i486 DX at the same bus speed thanks to the 8K on-chip cache shadowing the slower clocked external bus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/80486dx2-large.jpg/220px-80486dx2-large.jpg
