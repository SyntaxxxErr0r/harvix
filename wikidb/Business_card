94.0	Business_card	Business card	Business cards are cards bearing business information about a company or individual. They are shared during formal introductions as a convenience and a memory aid. A business card typically includes the giver's name, company affiliation (usually with a logo) and contact information such as street addresses, telephone number(s), fax number, e-mail addresses and website. It can also include telex, bank account and tax code. Traditionally many cards were simple black text on white stock; today a professional business card will sometimes include one or more aspects of striking visual design.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/BusinessCardAttorney1895.jpg/200px-BusinessCardAttorney1895.jpg
