85.7	Time_management	Time management	All tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent and put in according quadrants. Tasks in unimportant/not urgent are dropped, tasks in important/urgent are done immediately and personally, tasks in unimportant/urgent are delegated and tasks in important/not urgent get an end date and are done personally. This method is said to have been used by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and is outlined in a quote attributed to him: What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/MerrillCoveyMatrix.png/220px-MerrillCoveyMatrix.png
