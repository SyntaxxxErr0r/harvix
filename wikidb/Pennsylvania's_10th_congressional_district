6.30	Pennsylvania's_10th_congressional_district	Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district	Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district is located primarily in the northeast corner of the state. The district was one of the 12 original districts created prior to the 4th Congress. It is currently represented by Republican Tom Marino, who defeated Democratic incumbent Chris Carney during the 2010 U.S. House elections. In 2006, the 10th district experienced one of the greatest party shifts among all House seats that switched party control: in 2004, Sherwood won with an 86% margin of victory over his nearest opponent and two years later, Carney unseated Sherwood by a 53%-47% margin. In 2008, Carney won reelection by 12 points but the district swung back in 2010, electing Tom Marino. The district is mostly Republican in its political composition, an aspect of the district that is reflected especially well in presidential elections. In 2004, President George W. Bush won 60 percent of the vote in the district and in 2008, Senator John McCain beat Senator Barack Obama here by a margin of 54 percent to 45 percent. Nonetheless, Carney easily won reelection as a Democrat the same year McCain won the district. However, in the 2010 midterm elections, Marino unseated Carney by a 55%-45% margin, a GOP victory that is largely attributed to Carney's March 2010 vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, comprehensive health care reform legislation signed into law by President Obama. The legislation was incredibly unpopular in a district resistant to government-led efforts in economic affairs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Pa10_109.png/350px-Pa10_109.png
