89.3	Kilroy_was_here	Kilroy was here	Kilroy was here is an American popular culture expression, often seen in graffiti. Its origins are debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle—a bald-headed man (possibly with a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with the fingers of each hand clutching the wall—is widely known among U.S. residents who lived during World War II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Kilroy_Was_Here_-_Washington_DC_WWII_Memorial.jpg/350px-Kilroy_Was_Here_-_Washington_DC_WWII_Memorial.jpg
