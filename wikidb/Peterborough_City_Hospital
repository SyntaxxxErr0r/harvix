1.00	Peterborough_City_Hospital	Peterborough City Hospital	Peterborough City Hospital in the United Kingdom is the new acute general district hospital serving the city of Peterborough and north Cambridgeshire, areas of east Northamptonshire and Rutland. The 612-bed, four-storey hospital on the site of the former Edith Cavell Hospital replaces both Peterborough District Hospital (which opened in 1928 as the War Memorial Hospital and was enlarged in continuous phases between 1960 and 1968) and the Edith Cavell Hospital (built 1988). Peterborough Maternity Unit, adjacent to the district hospital, closed and moved into a new dedicated women and childrenâ€™s unit at the new hospital at 9am on 30 November 2010, with Accident and Emergency transferring at 2am on 3 December. The services were fully transferred from Edith Cavell Hospital and Peterborough District Hospital on 7 December, after which Peterborough City Hospital became fully functional.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/NHS-Logo.svg/100px-NHS-Logo.svg.png
