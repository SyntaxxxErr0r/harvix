The memorial was created at the urging of Chicago firefighters, who helped to raise about 75% of the $170,000 cost of the statue. At the time it was dedicated, the names of 530 deceased firefighters were carved around its base.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Chicago_Fire_Department_The_Fallen_21_Memorial.jpg/220px-Chicago_Fire_Department_The_Fallen_21_Memorial.jpg
