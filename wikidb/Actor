163.5	Actor	Actor	An actor (sometimes actress for female; see terminology) is a person who acts in a dramatic production and who works in film, television, theatre, or radio in that capacity. The ancient Greek word for an "actor," (hypokrites), means literally "one who interprets"; in this sense, an actor is one who interprets a dramatic character.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Jim_Brochu_and_Steve_Schalchlin_-_The_Big_Voice_God_or_Merman.jpg/220px-Jim_Brochu_and_Steve_Schalchlin_-_The_Big_Voice_God_or_Merman.jpg
