2.10	Fyke	Fishing net	A fishing net or fishnet is a net that is used for fishing. Fishing nets are meshes usually formed by knotting a relatively thin thread. Modern nets are usually made of artificial polyamides like nylon, although nets of organic polyamides such as wool or silk thread were common until recently and are still used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/FraserRiverSalmonFishing.jpg/300px-FraserRiverSalmonFishing.jpg
