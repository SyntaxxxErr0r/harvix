118.4	Pinot_noir	Pinot noir	Pinot noir is a black wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. The name may also refer to wines created predominantly from Pinot noir grapes. The name is derived from the French words for "pine" and "black" alluding to the grape variety's tightly clustered dark purple pine coneâ€“shaped bunches of fruit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Chehalem_pinot_noir_grapes.jpg
