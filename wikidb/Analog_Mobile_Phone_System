It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America (and other locales) through the 1980s and into the 2000s. As of February 18, 2008, carriers in the United States were no longer required to support AMPS and companies such as AT&amp;T and Verizon have discontinued this service permanently. AMPS was discontinued in Australia in September 2000.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/DynaTAC8000X.jpg/220px-DynaTAC8000X.jpg
