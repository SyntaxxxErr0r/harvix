4.20	Cheviot,_New_Zealand	Cheviot, New Zealand	Cheviot is a town in the Hurunui District of north Canterbury, on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is on the Main North Line railway and State Highway 1 approximately 110 kilometres (68 mi) north of Christchurch. It was originally called Mackenzie after politician John McKenzie, who was closely identified with the settlement of Cheviot. This name was "in widespread use for a decade or two" but gradually fell into disuse. The post office was always known as Cheviot and by at least 1913 the township too was generally known as Cheviot.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/CheviotMainStreet3.JPG/250px-CheviotMainStreet3.JPG
