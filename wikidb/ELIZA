149.1	ELIZA	ELIZA	ELIZA is a computer program and an early example of primitive natural language processing. ELIZA operated by processing users' responses to scripts, the most famous of which was DOCTOR, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, DOCTOR sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. ELIZA was written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/GNU_Emacs_ELIZA_example.png/325px-GNU_Emacs_ELIZA_example.png
