75.4	Simulated_annealing	Simulated annealing	Simulated annealing (SA) is a generic probabilistic metaheuristic for the global optimization problem of locating a good approximation to the global optimum of a given function in a large search space. It is often used when the search space is discrete (e.g., all tours that visit a given set of cities). For certain problems, simulated annealing may be more efficient than exhaustive enumeration â€” provided that the goal is merely to find an acceptably good solution in a fixed amount of time, rather than the best possible solution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/SimulatedAnnealingFast.jpg/200px-SimulatedAnnealingFast.jpg
