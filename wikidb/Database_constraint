1.00	Database_constraint	Relational database	A relational database is a database that conforms to relational model theory. The software used in a relational database is called a relational database management system (RDBMS). Colloquial use of the term "relational database" may refer to the RDBMS software, or the relational database itself. A relational database is the predominant choice in storing data, over other models like the hierarchical database model or the network model.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Emp_Tables_%28Database%29.PNG/220px-Emp_Tables_%28Database%29.PNG
