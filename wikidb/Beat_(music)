56.1	Beat_(music)	Beat (music)	The beat is the basic unit of time in music, the pulse of the mensural level (or beat level). In popular use, the beat can refer to a variety of related concepts including: tempo, meter, rhythm and groove. In modern pop music, the term "beats" has increasingly become used to describe whole pieces of composed music. This is completely inaccurate in the traditional sense of the word, which describes only the rhythmic element and not melodic content.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Taiwanese_taiko_drummer.jpg/350px-Taiwanese_taiko_drummer.jpg
