53.5	Fusor	Fusor	The Farnsworthâ€“Hirsch fusor, or simply fusor, is an apparatus designed by Philo T. Farnsworth to create nuclear fusion. It has also been developed in various incarnations by researchers including Elmore, Tuck, and Watson, and more recently by George H. Miley and Robert W. Bussard. Unlike most controlled fusion systems, which slowly heat a magnetically confined plasma, the fusor injects "high temperature" ions directly into a reaction chamber, thereby avoiding a considerable amount of complexity. The approach is known as inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/US3386883_-_fusor.png/330px-US3386883_-_fusor.png
