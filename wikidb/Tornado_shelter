1.00	Tornado_shelter	Storm cellar	A storm shelter or storm cellar is a type of underground bunker designed to protect the occupants from violent severe weather, particularly tornadoes. They are most commonly seen in the US Midwest ("Tornado Alley") and Southeast where tornadoes are particularly frequent and the low water table permits underground structures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Storm_cellar.jpg/200px-Storm_cellar.jpg
