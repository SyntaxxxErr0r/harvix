84.6	Public_house	Public house	A public house, informally known as a pub, is a drinking establishment fundamental to the culture of Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. There are approximately 53,500 public houses in the United Kingdom. This number has been declining every year, so that nearly half of the smaller villages no longer have a local pub. In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community. The writings of Samuel Pepys describe the pub as the heart of England.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Pub.williams.arp.750pix.jpg/220px-Pub.williams.arp.750pix.jpg
