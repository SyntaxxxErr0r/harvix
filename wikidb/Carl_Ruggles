19.02	Carl_Ruggles	Carl Ruggles	Charles "Carl" Sprague Ruggles (March 11, 1876 â€“ October 24, 1971) was an American composer of the American Five group. He wrote finely crafted pieces using "dissonant counterpoint", a term coined by Charles Seeger to describe Ruggles' music. His method of atonal counterpoint was based on a non-serial technique of avoiding repeating a pitch class until a generally fixed number such as eight pitch classes intervened. He wrote painstakingly slowly so his output is quite small.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e4/Carlruggles.jpg
