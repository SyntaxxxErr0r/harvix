6.60	Coffee_pot	Coffeemaker	Coffeemakers or coffee machines are cooking appliances used to brew coffee without having to boil water in a separate container. While there are many different types of coffeemakers using a number of different brewing principles, in the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed in a paper or metal filter inside a funnel, which is set over a glass or ceramic coffee pot, a cooking pot in the kettle family. Cold water is poured into a separate chamber, which is then heated up to the boiling point, and directed into the funnel. This is also called automatic drip-brew.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Wikimedia_Coffeemakers_Officey_Photos-10.jpg/275px-Wikimedia_Coffeemakers_Officey_Photos-10.jpg
