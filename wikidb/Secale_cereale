3.40	Secale_cereale	Rye	Rye is a grass grown extensively as a grain and as a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (Hordeum) and wheat (Triticum). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries, or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Ear_of_rye.jpg/220px-Ear_of_rye.jpg
