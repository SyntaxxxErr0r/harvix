He is the former President of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, but is also something of a vigilante as he does everything in his power to ensure that drug dealers and rapists stay out of his town. However, during the fourth season, Clay involves the club with a number of drug dealings for his own protection and greed, wavering in his allegiance, and is revealed to be an antagonist. He is 6' 2" and has a number of tattoos, most notably a Grim Reaper on his upper right arm and a US Army Airborne badge on his upper left, showing Paratrooper wings and the phrase "Death From Above".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/ClayMorrow.jpg/250px-ClayMorrow.jpg
