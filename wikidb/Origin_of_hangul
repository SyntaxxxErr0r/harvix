1.00	Origin_of_hangul	Origin of hangul	Hangul is the native script of Korea, created in the mid fifteenth century under King Sejong, as both a complement and an alternative to the logographic Sino-Korean hanja. Initially denounced by the educated class as eonmun (vernacular writing), it only became the primary Korean script following independence from Japan in the mid-20th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Hunmin_jeong-eum.jpg/220px-Hunmin_jeong-eum.jpg
