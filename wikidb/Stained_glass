88.5	Stained_glass	Stained glass	The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works produced from it. Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Chartres_-_cath%C3%A9drale_-_rosace_nord.jpg/300px-Chartres_-_cath%C3%A9drale_-_rosace_nord.jpg
