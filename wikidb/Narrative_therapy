51.3	Narrative_therapy	Narrative therapy	The term "narrative therapy" has a specific meaning and is not the same as narrative psychology, or any other therapy that uses stories. Narrative therapy refers to the ideas and practices of Michael White, David Epston, and other practitioners who have built upon this work. The narrative therapist focuses upon narrative in the therapy. The narrative therapist is a collaborator with the client in the process of developing richer (or "thicker") narratives. In this process, narrative therapists ask questions to generate experientially vivid descriptions of life events that are not currently included in the plot of the problematic story.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Michael_White_photo.jpg/120px-Michael_White_photo.jpg
