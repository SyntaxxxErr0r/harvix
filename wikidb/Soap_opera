114.3	Soap_opera	Soap opera	A soap opera, sometimes called "soap" for short, is an ongoing, episodic work of dramatic fiction presented in serial format on radio or as television programming. The name soap opera stems from the original dramatic serials broadcast on radio that had soap manufacturers, such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Lever Brothers, as sponsors and producers. These early radio series were broadcast in weekday daytime slots, usually five days a week, when most listeners would be housewives; thus the shows were aimed at and consumed by a predominantly female audience.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Rosemary_prinz_as_the_world_turns.JPG/220px-Rosemary_prinz_as_the_world_turns.JPG
