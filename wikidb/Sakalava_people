2.00	Sakalava_people	Sakalava people	The Sakalava are an ethnic group of Madagascar numbering approximately 700,000 in population. Their name means "people of the long valleys." They occupy the Western edge of the island from Toliara in the south to Sambirano in the north. The Sakalava denominate a number of smaller ethnic groups that once comprised an ancient empire, rather than an ethnic group in its own right. The Sakalava speak several dialects of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo-polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Femme_sakalave%2C_1900-1910.jpg/220px-Femme_sakalave%2C_1900-1910.jpg
