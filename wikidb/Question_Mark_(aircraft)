It was used to establish new world records in aviation for sustained flight (heavier-than-air), refueled flight, sustained flight (lighter-than-air), and distance. The records were established between January 1 and January 7.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Atlantic_C-2A_refuelled_by_Douglas_C-1_USAF.JPG/285px-Atlantic_C-2A_refuelled_by_Douglas_C-1_USAF.JPG
