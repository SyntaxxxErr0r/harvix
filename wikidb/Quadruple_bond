1.21	Quadruple_bond	Quadruple bond	Chromium(II) acetate, Cr2(μ-O2CMe)4(H2O)2, was the first chemical compound containing a quadruple bond to be synthesized. It was described in 1844 by E. Peligot, although its distinctive bonding was not recognized for more than a century. The quadruple bond was first characterized in potassium octachlorodirhenate(III) or K2 ·2H2O by F. A. Cotton in 1964. The rhenium-rhenium bond length in this compound is only 224 pm. In the terminology of molecular orbital theory, the bonding is described as σ2π4δ2 with one sigma bond, two pi bonds and one delta bond.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Octachlorodirhenate%28III%29-3D-balls.png/150px-Octachlorodirhenate%28III%29-3D-balls.png
