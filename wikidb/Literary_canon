13.00	Literary_canon	Western canon	The term Western canon denotes a criteria of books and, more broadly, music and art that have been the most important and influential in shaping Western culture. As such, it includes the "greatest works of artistic merit." Such a canon is important to the theory of educational perennialism and the development of "high culture". In practice, debates and attempts to define the canon in lists are essentially restricted to literature, including poetry, fiction and drama; biographical and autobiographical writings; philosophy; and history. A few accessible books on the sciences and mathematics are also included.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Parnaso_09.jpg/220px-Parnaso_09.jpg
