86.3	Compressed_natural_gas	Compressed natural gas	Compressed natural gas (CNG) is a fossil fuel substitute for gasoline (petrol), diesel, or propane/LPG. Although its combustion does produce greenhouse gases, it is a more environmentally clean alternative to those fuels, and it is much safer than other fuels in the event of a spill (natural gas is lighter than air, and disperses quickly when released). CNG may also be mixed with biogas, produced from landfills or wastewater, which doesn't increase the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/CNGlogo.svg/220px-CNGlogo.svg.png
