82.1	Vanilla	Vanilla	Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily from the Mexican species, Flat-leaved Vanilla . The word vanilla is derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word "" meaning sheath or pod, and simply translates as little pod. Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican peoples cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlilxochitl by the Aztecs, and Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Vanilla_6beans.JPG/170px-Vanilla_6beans.JPG
