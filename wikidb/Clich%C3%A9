51.6	Clich%C3%A9	Cliché	A cliché or cliche is an expression, idea, or element of an artistic work which has been overused to the point of losing its original meaning or effect, especially when at some earlier time it was considered meaningful or novel. In phraseology, the term has taken on a more technical meaning, referring to any expression imposed by conventionalized linguistic usage. The term is frequently used in modern culture for an action or idea which is expected or predictable, based on a prior event. Typically a pejorative, "clichés" are not always false or inaccurate; a cliché may or may not be true. Some are stereotypes, but some are simply truisms and facts. Clichés are often employed for comic effect, typically in fiction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/1885_Punch_three-volume-novel-parody_Priestman-Atkinson.png/220px-1885_Punch_three-volume-novel-parody_Priestman-Atkinson.png
