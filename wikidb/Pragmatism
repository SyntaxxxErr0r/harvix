127.2	Pragmatism	Pragmatism	Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition centered on the linking of practice and theory. It describes a process where theory is extracted from practice, and applied back to practice to form what is called intelligent practice. Important positions characteristic of pragmatism include instrumentalism, radical empiricism, verificationism, conceptual relativity, and fallibilism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Charles_Sanders_Peirce_theb3558.jpg/220px-Charles_Sanders_Peirce_theb3558.jpg
