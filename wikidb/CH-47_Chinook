64.8	CH-47_Chinook	Boeing CH-47 Chinook	The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is an American twin-engine, tandem rotor heavy-lift helicopter. Its top speed of 170 knots (196 mph, 315 km/h) is faster than contemporary utility and attack helicopters of the 1960s. It is one of the few aircraft of that era, such as the C-130 Hercules and the UH-1 Iroquois, that is still in production and front line service with over 1,179 built to date. Its primary roles include troop movement, artillery emplacement and battlefield resupply. It has a wide loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage and three external-cargo hooks.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/080301-F-2207D-394.jpg/300px-080301-F-2207D-394.jpg
