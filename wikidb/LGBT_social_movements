54.9	LGBT_social_movements	LGBT social movements	Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender social movements share inter-related goals of social acceptance of sexual and gender minorities. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and their allies have a long history of campaigning for what is generally called LGBT rights, also called gay rights and gay and lesbian rights. Various communities have worked not only together, but also independent of each other in various configurations including gay liberation, lesbian feminism, the queer movement and transgender activism. There is no one organization representing all LGBT people and interests, although arguably two organizations come close; InterPride by coordinating and networking gay pride events worldwide, and International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) which addresses human rights violations against LGBT and HIV-positive people and works with the United Nations are seen as broadly inclusive all LGBT communities and interests.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Gay_Rights_demonstration%2C_NYC_1976.jpg/220px-Gay_Rights_demonstration%2C_NYC_1976.jpg
