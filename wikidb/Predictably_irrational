10.21	Predictably_irrational	Predictably Irrational	Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions is a 2008 book by Dan Ariely, in which he challenges readers' assumptions about making decisions based on rational thought. Ariely explains, "My goal, by the end of this book, is to help you fundamentally rethink what makes you and the people around you tick. I hope to lead you there by presenting a wide range of scientific experiments, findings, and anecdotes that are in many cases quite amusing. Once you see how systematic certain mistakes are--how we repeat them again and again--I think you will begin to learn how to avoid some of them".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/Predictably_Irrational_Book_Cover.jpg/200px-Predictably_Irrational_Book_Cover.jpg
