1.00	SEA_1000	Collins class submarine replacement project	The Australian Government and Australian Defence Force (ADF) believe that the Royal Australian Navy's submarine service forms a vital component of the ADF and thus will double in size as countries in Australia's region expand or establish their own submarine forces. The role of the new submarines will be to collect intelligence, attack ships, submarines and land targets with missiles and torpedoes and land special forces teams. The submarines' capabilities will also act as a deterrent against military attacks on Australia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Australian_Submarine_Corporation_building.jpg/220px-Australian_Submarine_Corporation_building.jpg
