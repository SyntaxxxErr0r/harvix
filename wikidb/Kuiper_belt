152.4	Kuiper_belt	Kuiper belt	The Kuiper belt ( , rhyming with "viper"), sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt, is a region of the Solar System beyond the planets extending from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. It is similar to the asteroid belt, although it is far larger—20 times as wide and 20 to 200 times as massive. Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies, or remnants from the Solar System's formation. While the asteroid belt is composed primarily of rock, ices, and metal, the Kuiper objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (termed "ices"), such as methane, ammonia and water. The classical (low-eccentricity) belt is home to at least three dwarf planets: Pluto, Haumea, and Makemake. Some of the Solar System's moons, such as Neptune's Triton and Saturn's Phoebe, are also believed to have originated in the region.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Outersolarsystem_objectpositions_labels_comp.png/300px-Outersolarsystem_objectpositions_labels_comp.png
