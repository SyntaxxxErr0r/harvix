6.20	Mario_Scaramella	Mario Scaramella	Between 2000 and 2002 he was secretary general of the Naples based organization Environmental Crime Prevention Program (ECPP), another empty shell which directly passed to have second plenary conference in 1997 in order to better convince of its legitimacy as an intergovernmental organization. He then managed to convince NATO to fund him, opening an office in Vilnius, Lithuania, before managing to acquire a first temporary, then permanent observatory status at the London Convention, an international group linked to the International Maritime Organization. According to the International Herald Tribune, this "phony organization" then signed on 12 October 2000, a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation with the Secretariat of the Basel Convention on the Environment, which is part of the United Nations Environment Programme. One of his few public appearances was in 2002 at a security related conference, giving a lecture on "space anti-terror technologies". ECPP's observership's status to the London Convention/Protocol meetings was withdrawn in July 2007.
