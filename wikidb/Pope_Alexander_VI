71.0	Pope_Alexander_VI	Pope Alexander VI	Pope Alexander VI (Spanish: ), born Roderic Llançol i de Borja (Spanish: ; 1 January 1431 – 18 August 1503) was pope from 1492 until his death in 1503. He is one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes, and his Italianized surname Borgia became a byword for the debased standards of the Papacy of that era. But his reputation is mostly drawn from his enemies, the Italian prelates and barons whose power he subverted. Two of Alexander's successors Sixtus V and Urban VIII described him as one of the most outstanding popes since St. Peter. His reputation rests more on his considerable skills as a diplomat, politician and civil administrator rather than as a pastor, although regarding the latter he was no more or less effective than any of the other renaissance pontiffs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Pope_Alexander_Vi.jpg/220px-Pope_Alexander_Vi.jpg
