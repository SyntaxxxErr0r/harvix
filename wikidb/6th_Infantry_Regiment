6.00	6th_Infantry_Regiment	6th Infantry Regiment (United States)	The 6th Infantry Regiment (“Regulars”) was formed in 1812. Its most famous commander was Zachary Taylor, later the twelfth President of the United States. The Motto, "Regulars, By God!" derives from the Battle of Chippawa, in which British general Riall noticed that the approaching regiment had on the uniforms of militia, which the British had defeated at Queenstown Heights. Instead, the Americans pressed the attack. Riall is assumed to have said. "Those are Regulars, By God!" (though the only source of this was opposing U.S. general Winfield Scott).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/6_Infantry_Regiment_DUI.png/150px-6_Infantry_Regiment_DUI.png
