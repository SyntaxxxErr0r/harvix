1.00	Lemonshark	Lemon shark	The lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, shark in the family Carcharhinidae, can grow to 10 feet (3.0 m) long. It is known as the lemon shark because, at certain depths, light interacting with the local seawater can give this shark a tanned and yellow, pitted appearance, much like the surface of a lemon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Lemonshark_%282%29.jpg/240px-Lemonshark_%282%29.jpg
