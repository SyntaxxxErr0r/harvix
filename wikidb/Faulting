4.00	Faulting	Fault (geology)	In geology, a fault is a planar fracture or discontinuity in a volume of rock, across which there has been significant displacement along the fractures as a result of earth movement. Large faults within the Earth's crust result from the action of tectonic forces. Energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the cause of most earthquakes, such as occurs on the San Andreas Fault, California.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/The_Blue_Anchor_Fault_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2455274.jpg/300px-The_Blue_Anchor_Fault_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2455274.jpg
