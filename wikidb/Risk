151.9	Risk	Risk	Risk is the potential that a chosen action or activity (including the choice of inaction) will lead to a loss (an undesirable outcome). The notion implies that a choice having an influence on the outcome exists (or existed). Potential losses themselves may also be called "risks". Almost any human endeavor carries some risk, but some are much more risky than others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/3_Alarm_Building_Fire.jpg/220px-3_Alarm_Building_Fire.jpg
