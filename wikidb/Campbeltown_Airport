It is still owned by the Ministry of Defence, under a 'care and maintenance' programme, but a part of the airport is now run as a commercial enterprise by the Highlands and Islands Airports Limited, a company under the control of the Scottish Government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Control_Tower%2C_Campbeltown_Airport.jpg/200px-Control_Tower%2C_Campbeltown_Airport.jpg
