2.10	Modular_discriminant	Weierstrass's elliptic functions	The Weierstrass elliptic function can be defined in three closely related ways, each of which possesses certain advantages. One is as a function of a complex variable z and a lattice Λ in the complex plane. Another is in terms of z and two complex numbers ω1 and ω2 defining a pair of generators, or periods, for the lattice. The third is in terms z and of a modulus τ in the upper half-plane. This is related to the previous definition by τ = ω2/ω1, which by the conventional choice on the pair of periods is in the upper half-plane. Using this approach, for fixed z the Weierstrass functions become modular functions of τ.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Weierstrass_p.svg/100px-Weierstrass_p.svg.png
