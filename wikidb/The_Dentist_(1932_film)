3.01	The_Dentist_(1932_film)	The Dentist (1932 film)	The Dentist is a 1932 American comedy short starring W. C. Fields. The film is one of four short films Fields made with the "king of comedy," Mack Sennett, at Paramount. Although Sennett was near the end of his career, he found good use of the new medium of talking pictures for comedy, as the film demonstrates. It was directed by Leslie Pearce from a script by Fields himself. The film has running time of 20 minutes and has been released on VHS and DVD.
