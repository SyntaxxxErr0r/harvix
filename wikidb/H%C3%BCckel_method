3.02	H%C3%BCckel_method	HÃ¼ckel method	The theory predicts two energy levels for ethylene with its two pi electrons filling the low-energy HOMO and the high energy LUMO remaining empty. In butadiene the 4 pi electrons occupy 2 low energy MO's out of a total of 4 and for benzene 6 energy levels are predicted two of them degenerate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Ethylene-LUMO-Spartan-3D-balls.png/150px-Ethylene-LUMO-Spartan-3D-balls.png
