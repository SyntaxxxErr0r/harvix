The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form within this basin between April and December. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean — the Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. An average of four to six storms form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November. Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45°E and 100°E are included in the season by the IMD.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/1992_North_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season_summary.jpg/300px-1992_North_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season_summary.jpg
