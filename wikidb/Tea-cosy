1.00	Tea-cosy	Tea cosy	A tea cosy is a cover for a teapot, traditionally made of cloth or wool, which is used to insulate the tea, keeping it warm while it brews. Cloth tea cosies often have padded inserts, which can be removed and washed separately.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/Cushions_%26_Cosies_Front_Cover.jpg/220px-Cushions_%26_Cosies_Front_Cover.jpg
