CSR policy functions as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards, and international norms. The goal of CSR is to embrace responsibility for the company's actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere who may also be considered as stakeholders.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/CSR_framework_-_value1.jpg/500px-CSR_framework_-_value1.jpg
