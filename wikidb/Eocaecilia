4.32	Eocaecilia	Eocaecilia	Eocaecilia micropodia is an extinct species of caecilian (limbless amphibian) from the Early Jurassic Period in Arizona, USA. It shared some characteristics with salamanders and the now extinct Microsauria. Unlike modern caecilians, which are legless, Eocaecilia possessed small legs, and while modern caecilians have poorly developed eyes and spend a lot of time under ground, Eocaecilia's eyes were still well-developed, indicating it was not subterranean.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Eocaecilia_BW.jpg/220px-Eocaecilia_BW.jpg
