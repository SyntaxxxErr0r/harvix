94.9	Meningitis	Meningitis	Meningitis is inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The inflammation may be caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms, and less commonly by certain drugs. Meningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord; therefore the condition is classified as a medical emergency.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Meninges-en.svg/230px-Meninges-en.svg.png
