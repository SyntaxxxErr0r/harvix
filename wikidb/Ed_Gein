81.6	Ed_Gein	Ed Gein	Edward Theodore "Ed" Gein (August 27, 1906 â€“ July 26, 1984) was an American murderer and body snatcher. His crimes, committed around his hometown of Plainfield, Wisconsin, gathered widespread notoriety after authorities discovered Gein had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned trophies and keepsakes from their bones and skin. After police found body parts in his house in 1957, Gein confessed to killing two women: tavern owner Mary Hogan, in 1954; and a Plainfield hardware store owner, Bernice Worden, in 1957.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Edgein.jpg
