56.0	Temple_garment	Temple garment	A temple garment (also referred to as garments, or Mormon underwear) is a type of underwear worn by members of some denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement, after they have taken part in the Endowment ceremony. Garments are worn both day and night and are required for any previously endowed adult to enter a temple. The undergarments are viewed as a symbolic reminder of the covenants made in temple ceremonies, and are viewed as either a symbolic or literal source of protection from the evils of the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Mormon_garments.jpg/220px-Mormon_garments.jpg
