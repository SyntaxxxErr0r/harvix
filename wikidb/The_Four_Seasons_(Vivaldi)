63.8	The_Four_Seasons_(Vivaldi)	The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)	The four concertos were written to accompany four sonnets. Though it is not known who wrote these sonnets, there is a theory that Vivaldi wrote them himself, given that each sonnet is broken down into three sections, neatly corresponding to a movement in the concerto. Whoever wrote the sonnets, The Four Seasons may be classified as program music, music that intends to evoke something extra-musical.
