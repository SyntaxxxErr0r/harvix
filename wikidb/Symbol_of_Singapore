2.20	Symbol_of_Singapore	Lion head symbol of Singapore	The lion head symbol was introduced in 1986 as an alternative national symbol of Singapore. The lion head was chosen as a logo, as it best captures the characteristics of Singapore's reputation as a Lion City. It is used in less formal occasions mainly to promote Singapore's national identity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Singapore_lion_head_symbol.png
