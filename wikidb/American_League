64.6	American_League	American League	The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League , is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is often called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the "Senior Circuit").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c9/AL_logo.png/150px-AL_logo.png
