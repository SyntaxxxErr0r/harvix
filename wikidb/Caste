97.7	Caste	Caste	Caste is an elaborate and complex social system that combines some or all elements of endogamy, hereditary transmission of occupation, social class, social identity, hierarchy, exclusion and power. Haviland defines caste as a closed form of social stratification in which membership is determined by birth and remains fixed for life; castes are also endogamous and offsprings are automatically members of their parent's caste.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/PiraSocVirreinatoPer%C3%BA.jpg/220px-PiraSocVirreinatoPer%C3%BA.jpg
