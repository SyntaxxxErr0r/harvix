1.21	Canada_under_British_Imperial_control	Canada under British rule (1763â€“1867)	Territories, colonies and provinces that would become part of modern Canada were under control of the English, and later British, Empire from the sixteenth century, when France also had claims in the area. However, the most populous areas of Canada in the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes region, as well as much of the Maritime province were acquired under the Treaty of Paris of 1763 when France gave up all claims to mainland North America, and former French colonies were transferred to Britain. Canada remained a collection of separate British colonies until Confederation in 1867. Several major events took place during the era of British rule time that affected what is generally referred to as British North America, including the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Rebellions of 1837. British imperial control of Canada did not end in 1867. A number of colonies of British North America, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation. Following Confederation the Dominion of Canada itself also remained part of the British Empire and constitutionally subject to imperial control until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and answerable to the British Parliament until 1982 and the Canada Act in which Canada became independent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/NorthAmerica1762-83.png/340px-NorthAmerica1762-83.png
