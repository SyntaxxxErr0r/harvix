62.7	Scopolamine	Scopolamine	Scopolamine, also known as levo-duboisine, and hyoscine, is a tropane alkaloid drug with muscarinic antagonist effects. It is among the secondary metabolites of plants from Solanaceae (nightshade) family of plants, such as henbane, jimson weed and Angel's Trumpets , and corkwood (Duboisia). Although scopolamine is sometimes portrayed in the media as a dangerous drug, its anticholinergic properties give it some legitimate medical applications in very minute doses. An example is the treatment of motion sickness by use of a transdermal patch.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/L-Scopolamin.svg/200px-L-Scopolamin.svg.png
