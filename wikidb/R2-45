13.03	R2-45	R2-45	R2-45 is a Scientology auditing process created by L. Ron Hubbard. The process of R2-45 specifically pertains to shooting the target with a Colt .45 pistol, causing the victim's "thetan" to leave the body . In 1952 during a meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, Hubbard demonstrated the process of R2-45 by firing a shot at the floor. In a lecture of 1958, Hubbard comments that "Death is not the same as clearing but there is, remember, R2-45. It's a very valid technique. A lot of people have used it before now."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/M1911_A1_pistol.jpg/220px-M1911_A1_pistol.jpg
