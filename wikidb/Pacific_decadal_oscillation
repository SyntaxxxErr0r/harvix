53.5	Pacific_decadal_oscillation	Pacific decadal oscillation	The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a pattern of Pacific climate variability that shifts phases on at least inter-decadal time scale, usually about 20 to 30 years. The PDO is detected as warm or cool surface waters in the Pacific Ocean, north of 20Â° N. During a "warm", or "positive", phase, the west Pacific becomes cool and part of the eastern ocean warms; during a "cool" or "negative" phase, the opposite pattern occurs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/PDO_Pattern.png/300px-PDO_Pattern.png
