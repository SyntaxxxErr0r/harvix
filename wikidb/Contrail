108.5	Contrail	Contrail	Contrails (short for "condensation trails") or vapour trails are artificial clouds that are the visible trails of condensed water vapour made by the exhaust of aircraft engines. As the hot exhaust gases cool in the surrounding air they may precipitate a cloud of microscopic water droplets or, if the air is cold enough, tiny ice crystals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Contrails_from_a_S7_Tupolev_Tu-154M_Karakas.jpg/300px-Contrails_from_a_S7_Tupolev_Tu-154M_Karakas.jpg
