2.00	Maria_Antonia_railway	Maria Antonia railway	The Maria Antonia railway is a line built between 1848 and 1859 connecting the Tuscan cities of Florence, Prato, Pistoia and Lucca. The first section from Florence to Pistoia (which was in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany at the time) was named in honour of Princess Maria Antonia of the Two Sicilies, wife of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had already been honoured in the naming of the Leopolda railway from Florence to Livorno. It is fully electrified at 3,000 V DC. Passenger traffic is managed by Trenitalia.
