3.00	The_Mix_(Kraftwerk_album)	The Mix (Kraftwerk album)	The Mix is a 1991 remix album by Kraftwerk. It featured re-recorded versions of a selection of songs which had originally appeared on the albums Autobahn through Electric Café. Hütter stated in interviews that he regarded The Mix as a type of live album, as it captured the results of the band's continual digital improvisations in their Kling Klang studio. The band made a return to the stage in 1990, after a nine-year hiatus from touring. Most of the songs featured on their set list from this point to the present time have been heavily rearranged in a similar fashion to what appears on the album.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/The_Mix.jpg/220px-The_Mix.jpg
