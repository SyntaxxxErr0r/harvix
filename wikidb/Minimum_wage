85.6	Minimum_wage	Minimum wage	A minimum wage is the lowest hourly, daily or monthly remuneration that employers may legally pay to workers. Equivalently, it is the lowest wage at which workers may sell their labor. Although minimum wage laws are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/1903sweatshopchicago.jpg/220px-1903sweatshopchicago.jpg
