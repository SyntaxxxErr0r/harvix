52.1	VHF_omnidirectional_range	VHF omnidirectional range	VOR, short for VHF omnidirectional radio range, is a type of short-range radio navigation system for aircraft, enabling aircraft to determine their position and stay on course by receiving radio signals transmitted by a network of fixed ground radio beacons, with a receiver unit. It uses radio frequencies in the very high frequency (VHF) band from 108 to 117.95 MHz. Developed in the US beginning in 1937 and deployed by 1946, VOR is the standard air navigational system in the world, used by both commercial and general aviation. There are about 3000 VOR stations around the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/D-VOR_PEK.JPG/220px-D-VOR_PEK.JPG
