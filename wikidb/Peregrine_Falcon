108.5	Peregrine_Falcon	Peregrine Falcon	The Peregrine Falcon , also known as the Peregrine, and historically as the Duck Hawk in North America, is a widespread bird of prey in the family Falconidae. A large, crow-sized falcon, it has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head and "moustache". As is typical of bird-eating raptors, Peregrine Falcons are sexually dimorphic, females being considerably larger than males. The Peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over 322 km/h (200 mph) during its characteristic hunting stoop (high speed dive), making it the fastest member of the animal kingdom.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Falco_peregrinus_-Nova_Scotia%2C_Canada_-eating-8.jpg/220px-Falco_peregrinus_-Nova_Scotia%2C_Canada_-eating-8.jpg
