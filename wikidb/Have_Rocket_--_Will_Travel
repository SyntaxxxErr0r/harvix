By this time, the trio consisted of Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Joe DeRita (dubbed "Curly Joe"). Released by Columbia Pictures, the feature was produced to capitalize on the comedy trio's late 1950s resurgence in popularity. The title is a parody of the then-popular television show Have Gun, Will Travel, and its soundtrack featured songs such as "Swinging the Alphabet" and "Aba Daba Honeymoon".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a7/Haverocketposter.jpeg/220px-Haverocketposter.jpeg
