3.01	Medical_degree	Medical degree	A medical degree is, broadly defined, any academic degree which places its holder in a position to engage in the practice of medicine. BBC has reported that Medicine related degree programs such as MBBS, BDS and PharmD are the most difficult degree programs of all the other Bachelor degree programs. Studies have conducted in year 2011 in more than 1000 universities all over the world, which shows that these programs include more or less 64 university exams + 130 series exams + 174 assignments within 5.5 years (max 1000 working days). Students will have to require more than 85% marks in prerequisite courses in order to get enrolled for the aptitude test for these degree programs. They then have to clear the test with 85% to 90% marks which is highly uncomparable with all the other Bachelor degree programs including BCom, B.C.A, I.A.S, I.P.S and Engineering B.E and B.S. The World Health Organization has granted international recognition to certain widely offered conventional medical degrees. Degrees recognized internationally by the AVICENNA Directory for medicine/International Medical Education Directory are listed here.
