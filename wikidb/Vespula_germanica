4.11	Vespula_germanica	Vespula germanica	The German wasp, or European wasp, Vespula germanica, is a wasp found in much of the Northern Hemisphere, native to Europe, northern Africa, and temperate Asia. It has been introduced and is well-established in many other places, including North America, South America , Australia and New Zealand. German wasps are part of the family Vespidae and are sometimes mistakenly referred to as paper wasps because they build grey paper nests, although strictly speaking, paper wasps are part of the subfamily Polistinae. In North America, they are also known as yellowjackets.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/European_wasp_white_bg.jpg/250px-European_wasp_white_bg.jpg
