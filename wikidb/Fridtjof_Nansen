In his youth a champion skier and ice skater, he led the team that made the first crossing of the Greenland interior in 1888, and won international fame after reaching a record northern latitude of 86°14′ during his North Pole expedition of 1893–96. Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent Arctic and Antarctic expeditions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Fridtjof_Nansen_LOC_03377u-3.jpg/220px-Fridtjof_Nansen_LOC_03377u-3.jpg
