6.20	Second_Battle_of_Mogadishu	Battle of Mogadishu (2006)	The Second Battle of Mogadishu was a battle fought for control of Mogadishu, the capital city of Somalia. The opposing forces were the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism (ARPCT), and militia loyal to the Islamic Court Union (ICU). The conflict began in mid-February, 2006, when Somali warlords formed the ARPCT to challenge the emerging influence of the ICU. It had been alleged that the United States was providing funding for the ARPCT due to concerns that the ICU had ties to al-Qaeda. The ICU militia won control of Mogadishu and ARPCT forces left the city.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Somalia%26land_map.png/250px-Somalia%26land_map.png
