30.27	Chicago_blues	Chicago blues	The Chicago blues is a form of blues music that developed in Chicago, Illinois, by taking the basic acoustic guitar and harmonica-based Delta blues, making the harmonica louder with a microphone and an instrument amplifier, and adding electrically amplified guitar, amplified bass guitar, drums, piano and sometimes saxophone and trumpet. The music developed in the first half of the twentieth century due to the Great Migration (African American) when Black workers moved from the South into the industrial cities of the North such as Chicago.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/BuddyGuyBonnaroo2006.jpg/220px-BuddyGuyBonnaroo2006.jpg
