Sport governing bodies come in various forms, and have a variety of regulatory functions. Examples of this can include disciplinary action for rule infractions and deciding on rule changes in the sport which they govern. Governing bodies have different scopes. They may cover a range of sport at an international level, like the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee, or only a single sport at a national level, like the Rugby Football League. National bodies may or may not be affiliated to international bodies for the same sport. The first international federations were formed at the end of the 19th century.
