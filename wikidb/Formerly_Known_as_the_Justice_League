2.00	Formerly_Known_as_the_Justice_League	Super Buddies	Super Buddies are a team of comic book superheroes in the DC Comics universe who appeared in the six-issue Formerly Known as the Justice League miniseries in 2003, and its 2005 sequel, I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League (published in JLA Classified). The team was put together by former Justice League bank roller Maxwell Lord as a superhero team "accessible to the common man". Named after the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon Super Friends, the team is considered more or less inept and incapable of being of any help by many (including the actual Justice League). The team was created by writers Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis, and artists Kevin Maguire and Joe Rubinstein. The storyline is fully canon and can be placed shortly after the return of Green Arrow (Ollie Queen) to life thanks to a comment made by Power Girl in I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/FormerlyKnownAsJLTPCVR.jpg/250px-FormerlyKnownAsJLTPCVR.jpg
