1.20	Analytical_Chemistry	Analytical chemistry	Analytical chemistry is the study of the separation, identification, and quantification of the chemical components of natural and artificial materials. Qualitative analysis gives an indication of the identity of the chemical species in the sample and quantitative analysis determines the amount of one or more of these components. The separation of components is often performed prior to analysis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Bunsen-Kirchhoff.jpg/200px-Bunsen-Kirchhoff.jpg
