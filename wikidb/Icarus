93.4	Icarus	Icarus	In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English; Greek: , Íkaros, Etruscan: Vikare) is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus. The main story told about Icarus is his attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. He ignored instructions not to fly too close to the sun, and the melting wax caused him to fall into the sea where he drowned. The myth shares thematic similarities with that of Phaëton — both are usually taken as tragic examples of hubris or failed ambition — and is often depicted in art. Today, the Hellenic Air Force Academy is named after Icarus, who is seen as the mythical pioneer in Greece's attempt to conquer the skies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Bruegel%2C_Pieter_de_Oude_-_De_val_van_icarus_-_hi_res.jpg/300px-Bruegel%2C_Pieter_de_Oude_-_De_val_van_icarus_-_hi_res.jpg
