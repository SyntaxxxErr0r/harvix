135.0	Password_strength	Password strength	Random passwords consist of a string of symbols of specified length taken from some set of symbols using a random selection process in which each symbol is equally likely to be selected. The symbols can be individual characters from a character set (e.g., the ASCII character set), syllables designed to form pronounceable passwords, or even words from a word list (thus forming a passphrase).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/PassWord_Strength.png/220px-PassWord_Strength.png
