50.9	Highland_games	Highland games	Highland games are events held throughout the year in Scotland and other countries as a way of celebrating Scottish and Celtic culture and heritage, especially that of the Scottish Highlands. Certain aspects of the games are so well known as to have become emblematic of Scotland, such as the bagpipes, the kilt, and the heavy events, especially the caber toss. While centred on competitions in piping and drumming, dancing, and Scottish heavy athletics, the games also include entertainment and exhibits related to other aspects of Scottish and Gaelic culture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Highland_Games-Opening_ceremonies_in_Canmore.jpg/220px-Highland_Games-Opening_ceremonies_in_Canmore.jpg
