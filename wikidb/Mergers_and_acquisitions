144.4	Mergers_and_acquisitions	Mergers and acquisitions	Mergers and acquisitions (abbreviated M&amp;A) refers to the aspect of corporate strategy, corporate finance and management dealing with the buying, selling, dividing and combining of different companies and similar entities that can help an enterprise grow rapidly in its sector or location of origin, or a new field or new location, without creating a subsidiary, other child entity or using a joint venture. The distinction between a "merger" and an "acquisition" has become increasingly blurred in various respects (particularly in terms of the ultimate economic outcome), although it has not completely disappeared in all situations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Met_life_tower_crop.jpg/135px-Met_life_tower_crop.jpg
