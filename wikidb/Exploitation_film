51.3	Exploitation_film	Exploitation film	Exploitation film is a type of film that takes advantage of subject matter that is often lurid. The term exploitation is common in film marketing for promotion or advertising in any type of film. These films then need something to exploit, such as a big star, special effects, sex, violence, or romance. An exploitation film, however, relies heavily on sensationalist advertising and broad overstatement of the issues, regardless of how they contribute to the intrinsic quality of the film. Very often, exploitation films are widely considered to be of low quality. Even so, they sometimes attract critical attention and cult followings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c9/Coffy.jpg/187px-Coffy.jpg
