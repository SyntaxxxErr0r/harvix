92.6	Ultra-Mobile_PC	Ultra-mobile PC	An ultra-mobile PC is a small form factor version of a pen computer, a class of laptop whose specifications were launched by Microsoft and Intel in spring 2006. Sony had already made a first attempt in this direction in 2004 with its Vaio U series, which was however only sold in Asia. UMPCs are smaller than subnotebooks, have a TFT display measuring (diagonally) about 12.7 to 17.8 cm, and are operated like tablet PCs using a touchscreen or a stylus. There is no clear boundary between subnotebooks and ultra-mobile PCs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Wibrain_B1_UMPC.jpg/250px-Wibrain_B1_UMPC.jpg
