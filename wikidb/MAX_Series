3.10	MAX_Series	ARCA Racing Series	The ARCA Racing Series powered by Menards is an American stock car series, the premier division of the ARCA. It is considered a minor, but professional, league of stock car racing, perhaps two steps down from the top-level NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and one step down from that series' minor league, the NASCAR Nationwide Series. Though some events occur the same weekend as NASCAR events, the Series is in no way affiliated with NASCAR.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/11-ARS-MenardsLogo-4C-300x150.jpg/200px-11-ARS-MenardsLogo-4C-300x150.jpg
