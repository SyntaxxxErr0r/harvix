1.00	DEKA_(New_Zealand)	DEKA (New Zealand)	DEKA was a nationwide chain of general merchandise stores in New Zealand. It was launched in 1988 by L.D. Nathan, which split its supermarket and general merchandise divisions. In 1992 ownership of DEKA shifted to the Farmers Trading Company, which had until then been a competitor. As a result of unsustainable financial losses, all DEKA stores were either closed or converted to Farmers stores in 2001.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/DEKA_department_store_logo_from_2001.png
