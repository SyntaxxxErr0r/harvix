There is only one extant family and one genus (Manis) of pangolins, comprising eight species. There are also a number of extinct taxa. Pangolins have large keratin scales covering their skin and are the only mammals with this adaptation. They are found in tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The name "pangolin" derives from the Malay word pengguling ("something that rolls up").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Pangolin_borneo.jpg/220px-Pangolin_borneo.jpg
