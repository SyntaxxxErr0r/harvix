It shared its western border with Limmu-Ennarea, its eastern border with the Sidamo kingdom of Janjero, and was separated from the Kingdom of Kaffa to the south by the Gojeb River. Jimma was considered the most powerful, militarily, of the Gibe kingdoms. Dawro, an Ometo dialect, was the native language but is losing ground to Oromo.
