At its peak ACORN had over 500,000 members and more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in over 100 cities across the U.S., as well as in Argentina, Canada, Mexico, and Peru. ACORN was founded in 1970 by Wade Rathke and Gary Delgado. It filed for Chapter 7 liquidation on November 2, 2010, effectively closing the organization, although many chapters and state-wide organizations continued work under different name(s).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/76/Association_of_Community_Organizations_for_Reform_Now_%28logo%29.svg/200px-Association_of_Community_Organizations_for_Reform_Now_%28logo%29.svg.png
