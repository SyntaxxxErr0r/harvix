70.7	Strange_Fruit	Strange Fruit	"Strange Fruit" is a song performed most famously by Billie Holiday, who released her first recording of it in 1939, the year she first sang it. Written by the teacher Abel Meeropol as a poem, it exposed American racism, particularly the lynching of African Americans. Such lynchings had occurred chiefly in the South but also in all other regions of the United States. The writer, Abel, set it to music and with his wife and the singer Laura Duncan, performed it as a protest song in New York venues, including Madison Square Garden.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3e/Strange-Fuit.jpg/220px-Strange-Fuit.jpg
