72.1	Number_theory	Number theory	Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers. Number theorists study prime numbers (which, when multiplied, give all the integers) as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (such as rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (such as, for example, algebraic integers).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9d/Lehmer_sieve.jpg/250px-Lehmer_sieve.jpg
