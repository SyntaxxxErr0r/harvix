1.21	Mains_power_plug	AC power plugs and sockets	AC power plugs and sockets are devices for removably connecting electrically operated devices to the primary power supply in a building. ("AC" is an abbreviation for alternating current, which is usually used for building wiring around the world rather than direct current.) Electrical plugs and sockets differ by country in voltage and current rating, shape, size and type of connectors. The types used in each country are set by national standards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Schuko_plug_and_socket.png/200px-Schuko_plug_and_socket.png
