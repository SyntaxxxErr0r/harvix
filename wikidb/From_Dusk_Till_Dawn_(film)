The movie stars George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino and Juliette Lewis. The film was followed by two direct-to-video follow-ups, a sequel, From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money and a prequel, From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter. They were both received poorly by critics. Danny Trejo is the only actor to appear in all three, although Michael Parks appears in both From Dusk Till Dawn and The Hangman's Daughter. Rodriguez, Tarantino and Lawrence Bender served as producers on all three movies. In late 2010 it was reported that a possible fourth film in the series may be produced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/From_dusk_till_dawn_poster.jpg/220px-From_dusk_till_dawn_poster.jpg
