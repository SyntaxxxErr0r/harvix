These could be of the same or a variety of instruments. Consort music enjoyed considerable popularity at court and in households of the wealthy in the Elizabethan era and many pieces were written for consorts by the major composers of the period. In the Baroque era consort music was absorbed into chamber music.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/The_Smithsonian_Consort_of_Viols.jpg/310px-The_Smithsonian_Consort_of_Viols.jpg
