1.00	Micraster	Micraster	Micraster is an extinct genus of echinoid from the Late Cretaceous. Its remains have been found in Africa, Antarctica, Europe, and North America. Micraster was an infaunal echinoid living in a burrow below the sediment surface. the test is clearly bilateral and there is a deep anterior groove to take in water containing organic particles to the mouth. The tube feet keep a supply of nutrient-laden water moving into the burrow. The anus has a waste tube behind it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Micraster.jpg/250px-Micraster.jpg
