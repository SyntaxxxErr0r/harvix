51.6	Beloved_(novel)	Beloved (novel)	Beloved is a novel by the American writer Toni Morrison, published in 1987. Set in 1873 just after the American Civil War (1861â€“1865), it is based on the true story of the African-American slave, Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in 1856 in Kentucky by fleeing to Ohio, a free state. A posse arrived to retrieve her and her children under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which gave slave owners the right to pursue slaves across state borders. Margaret killed her two-year-old daughter rather than allow her to be recaptured.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/BelovedNovel.jpg/175px-BelovedNovel.jpg
