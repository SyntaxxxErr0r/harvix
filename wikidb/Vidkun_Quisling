52.7	Vidkun_Quisling	Vidkun Quisling	Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonssøn Quisling (Norwegian: ; 18 July 1887 – 24 October 1945) was a Norwegian politician. On 9 April 1940, with the German invasion of Norway in progress, he seized power in a Nazi-backed coup d'etat that garnered him international infamy. From 1942 to 1945 he served as Minister-President, working with the occupying forces. His government, known as the Quisling regime, was dominated by ministers from Nasjonal Samling, the party he had founded in 1933. The collaborationist government participated in Germany's Final Solution. Quisling was put on trial during the post-war legal purge in Norway and found guilty of charges including embezzlement, murder and high treason. He was executed by firing squad at Akershus Fortress, Oslo, on 24 October 1945. During World War II, quisling became a synonym for traitor.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/QuislingOslo1942.jpg/220px-QuislingOslo1942.jpg
