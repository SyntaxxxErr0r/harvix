2.00	ElevateDB	ElevateDB	ElevateDB is an embedded database engine developed and marketed by Elevate Software, Inc. ElevateDB supports most of the ANSI SQL:2003 standard with minimal deviations, and includes support for dynamic SQL/PSM in scripts, stored procedures/functions, triggers, and jobs. ElevateDB can be compiled directly into the application using Delphi/Lazarus/C++Builder, or is available as a single assembly (.NET data provider) for .NET and .NET Compact Framework applications and a single DLL (ODBC driver) for applications that can use the ODBC API for database access, such as Java and PHP.
