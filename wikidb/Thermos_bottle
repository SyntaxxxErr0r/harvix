2.21	Thermos_bottle	Vacuum flask	A vacuum flask (also known as a Dewar flask, Dewar bottle or Thermos) is an insulating storage vessel which keeps its contents hotter or cooler than its surroundings. Invented by Sir James Dewar in 1892, the vacuum flask consists of two flasks, placed one within the other and joined at the neck. The gap between the two flasks is partially evacuated of air, creating a near-vacuum which prevents heat transfer by conduction or convection.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Thermos_bottle.jpg/170px-Thermos_bottle.jpg
