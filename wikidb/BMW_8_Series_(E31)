7.10	BMW_8_Series_(E31)	BMW 8 Series (E31)	The BMW 8 Series (chassis code: E31) is a V8- or V12-engined 2-door 2+2 coupe built by BMW from 1989 to 1999. While it did supplant the original E24 based 6 Series in 1991, a common misconception is that the 8 Series was developed as a successor. However, it was actually an entirely new class aimed at a different market, with a substantially higher price and better performance than the 6 series. It was BMW's flagship car and had an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/BMW_840_Ci_Sport_front.jpg/250px-BMW_840_Ci_Sport_front.jpg
