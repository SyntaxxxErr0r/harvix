80.1	Leipzig	Leipzig	Leipzig has always been a trade city, situated during the time of the Holy Roman Empire at the intersection of the Via Regia and Via Imperii, two important trade routes. At one time, Leipzig was one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After World War II, Leipzig became a major urban centre within the Communist German Democratic Republic but its cultural and economic importance declined.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/AUGUSTUSPLATZ-014.jpg/268px-AUGUSTUSPLATZ-014.jpg
