6.30	12_Bar_Blues_(album)	12 Bar Blues (album)	12 Bar Blues is the debut solo album from Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland. Its sound and style differs greatly from his band's releases. The design concept of the cover is a homage to the cover design of John Coltrane's Blue Train album. The title name comes from the simple chord progression known as "Twelve-bar blues."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/12_bar_blues_weiland.jpg/220px-12_bar_blues_weiland.jpg
