1.11	Direct_grant_grammar_school	Direct grant grammar school	A direct-grant grammar school was a type of selective secondary school in England and Wales that existed between 1945 and 1976. Such schools were funded partly by the state and partly through private fees. One quarter of the places in these schools were directly funded by central government, while the remainder attracted fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority and some by private pupils. On average, these schools received just over half of their income from the state.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Mgs_side_on_view_circa_2000.jpg/220px-Mgs_side_on_view_circa_2000.jpg
