1.10	Assisted_reproductive_technologies	Assisted reproductive technology	Assisted reproductive technology is a general term referring to methods used to achieve pregnancy by artificial or partially artificial means. It is reproductive technology used primarily in infertility treatments. Some forms of ART are also used in fertile couples for genetic reasons. ART is also used in couples who are discordant for certain communicable diseases, e.g. AIDS, to reduce the risk of infection when a pregnancy is desired. Examples of ART include in vitro fertilisation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), cryopreservation, and intrauterine insemination (IUI). There is yet no strict definition of the term. Usage of the ART mainly belongs in the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Tr_icsi_03.jpg/250px-Tr_icsi_03.jpg
