51.8	Quorum	Quorum	A quorum is the minimum number of members of a deliberative assembly (a body that uses parliamentary procedure, such as a legislature) necessary to conduct the business of that group. According to Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, Tenth Edition, the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order, the "requirement for a quorum is protection against totally unrepresentative action in the name of the body by an unduly small number of persons."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/AGMA_Ostrakon_Th%C3%A9mistocle_1.jpg/200px-AGMA_Ostrakon_Th%C3%A9mistocle_1.jpg
