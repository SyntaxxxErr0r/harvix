171.1	Ptolemy	Ptolemy	Claudius Ptolemy (Greek: , Klaudios Ptolemaios; Latin: ; c. AD 90 â€“ c. AD 168), was a Greek-Roman citizen of Egypt who wrote in Greek. He was a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in Egypt under Roman rule, and is believed to have been born in the town of Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid. This theory, proposed by Theodore Meliteniotes, could be correct, but it is late (ca. 1360) and unsupported. There is no reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Ptolemaeus.jpg/220px-Ptolemaeus.jpg
