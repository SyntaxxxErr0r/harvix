13.83	Capital_Asset_Pricing_Model	Capital asset pricing model	In finance, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is used to determine a theoretically appropriate required rate of return of an asset, if that asset is to be added to an already well-diversified portfolio, given that asset's non-diversifiable risk. The model takes into account the asset's sensitivity to non-diversifiable risk (also known as systematic risk or market risk), often represented by the quantity beta (Î²) in the financial industry, as well as the expected return of the market and the expected return of a theoretical risk-free asset.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/CAPM-SML.svg/220px-CAPM-SML.svg.png
