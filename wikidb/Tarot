140.0	Tarot	Tarot	The tarot (first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi, tarock, and others) is a pack of playing cards (most commonly numbering 78), used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play a group of card games such as Italian tarocchini and French tarot. From the late 18th century until the present time the tarot has also found use by mystics and occultists in efforts at divination or as a map of mental and spiritual pathways.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Viscontisforzatarot.jpg/220px-Viscontisforzatarot.jpg
