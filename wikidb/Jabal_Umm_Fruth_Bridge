1.10	Jabal_Umm_Fruth_Bridge	Jabal Umm Fruth Bridge	Jabal Umm Fruth Rock Bridge is one of several rock bridges in the Wadi Rum area of Jordan.It has a spectacular drop on one side and is a popular destination for energetic tourists visiting the area, requiring some fairly taxing hill walking to reach it. Sadly, it is covered in graffiti - names and slogans carved into the soft rock by thoughtless visitors. Despite this, it is well worth visiting if in the Wadi Rum area.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wadi_Rum_Rock_Bridge.jpg/300px-Wadi_Rum_Rock_Bridge.jpg
