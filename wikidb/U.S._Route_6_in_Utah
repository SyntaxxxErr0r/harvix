1.00	U.S._Route_6_in_Utah	U.S. Route 6 in Utah	U.S. Route 6 is a major eastâ€“west state highway through the central part of the U.S. state of Utah. Although it is about 40 miles (64 km) longer than US-50, it serves more populated areas, and in fact follows what had been US-50's routing until it was moved to follow I-70 in 1976. In 2009, the Utah State Legislature named part of the route the Mike Dmitrich Highway, which generated controversy, as the state of Utah had previously joined with all the other states through which US-6 passes in naming all of US-6 the Grand Army of the Republic highway.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/US_6_%28UT%29_map.svg/290px-US_6_%28UT%29_map.svg.png
