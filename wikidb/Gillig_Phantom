2.10	Gillig_Phantom	Gillig Phantom	The Gillig Phantom was a transit bus produced by the Gillig Corporation in Hayward, California. The Phantom was first introduced in late 1980 and, with the exception of a small number of buses built in a three-year-long joint venture with Neoplan from 1977 to 1979, was Gillig's first transit bus. The first Phantoms were 35 feet long and 96 inches wide, however 30-foot and 40-foot models were offered beginning in 1981, and 102-inch-wide models became available in 1983. A liquefied natural gas fueled version was produced beginning in 1992, and was later discontinued. From 2005 onward, only the 102-inch-wide version was available due to stricter emissions and accessibility requirements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Unitrans_3902_at_the_Silo_-_cropped.jpg/250px-Unitrans_3902_at_the_Silo_-_cropped.jpg
