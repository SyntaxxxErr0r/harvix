81.7	Guerrilla_gardening	Guerrilla gardening	Guerrilla gardening is gardening on another person's land without permission. It encompasses a very diverse range of people and motivations, from the enthusiastic gardener who spills over their legal boundaries to the highly political gardener who seeks to provoke change through direct action. It has implications for land rights, land reform. The land that is guerrilla gardened is usually abandoned or neglected by its legal owner and the guerrilla gardeners take it over ("squat") to grow plants. Guerrilla gardeners believe in re-considering land ownership in order to reclaim land from perceived neglect or misuse and assign a new purpose to it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Guerrilla_gardening.jpg/220px-Guerrilla_gardening.jpg
