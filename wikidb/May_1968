55.4	May_1968	May 1968 in France	The May 1968 protest refers to a particular period in French history. It was historically significant for being the first wildcat general strike ever, and for being the largest general strike ever, bringing the economy of an advanced industrial country to a virtual standstill. It commenced with a series of student occupation protests. The strike involved 11,000,000 workers, over 22% of the total population of France at the time, for a continuous two weeks, and its impact was such that it almost caused the collapse of President Charles de Gaulle's government. In staging wildcat strikes, the movement contrasted with the trade unions and the French Communist Party (Parti Communiste Fran√ßais, PCF), which began to side with the de Gaulle government.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Paris68aCars.jpg/300px-Paris68aCars.jpg
