3.01	Stripping_(printing)	Stripping (printing)	Stripping is a dying trade in which film negatives are arranged in a pattern, which will create a series of pages. There is an individual negative for each color to be printed on a printing press. Colors are arranged in order to fit together with the other colors to be printed. This process has generally been eliminated through the use of digital prepress, in which imposition software is used to "digitally strip" the pages together. The digital product of this software can be outputted to an imagesetter that creates larger piece of film, or directly to a platesetter which generates a plate that can go directly to press.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/8up_imposition.svg/560px-8up_imposition.svg.png
