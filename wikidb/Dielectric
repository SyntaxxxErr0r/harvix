52.7	Dielectric	Dielectric	The electric susceptibility Ï‡e of a dielectric material is a measure of how easily it polarizes in response to an electric field. This, in turn, determines the electric permittivity of the material and thus influences many other phenomena in that medium, from the capacitance of capacitors to the speed of light.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Dielectric_model.svg/400px-Dielectric_model.svg.png
