55.1	Aquatic_ape_hypothesis	Aquatic ape hypothesis	The aquatic ape hypothesis is a hypothesis, generally not accepted in the scientific communty, that the ancestors of modern humans spent a period of time adapting to life in a wet environment. AAH emerged from the observation that some traits that set humans apart from other primates have parallels in aquatic mammals. It was first proposed by German pathologist Max Westenh√∂fer in 1942, and then independantly by British marine biologist Alister Hardy in 1960. After Hardy, the most prominent proponent has been Welsh screenwriter Elaine Morgan, who has written several books on the topic.
