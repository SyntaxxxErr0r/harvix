1.00	MSBS	MSBS Radon	MSBS-5,56 (short for Modu≈Çowy System Broni Strzeleckiej kalibru 5,56 mm or English: ) is an assault rifle currently under development as a future service rifle of the Polish Army. There are two basic variants under development currently, based on common upper receiver: a bullpup version and a standard version with folding, retractable stock. Thanks to a variety of modules, both variants are to be easily transformed into a carbine, sniper rifle or squad light machine gun. The rifle will be chambered for standard 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition, but 7.62x51mm NATO version will be also taken into consideration.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/MSBS-5%2C56.jpg/310px-MSBS-5%2C56.jpg
