61.0	Scientific_skepticism	Scientific skepticism	Scientific skepticism is the practice of questioning the veracity of claims lacking empirical evidence or reproducibility, as part of a methodological norm pursuing "the extension of certified knowledge". For example, Robert K. Merton asserts that all ideas must be tested and are subject to rigorous, structured community scrutiny (see Mertonian norms).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/PrirodneNauke.svg/100px-PrirodneNauke.svg.png
