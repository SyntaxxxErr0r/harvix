3.00	Mercedes-Benz_W25	Mercedes-Benz W25	The Mercedes-Benz W25 was a Grand Prix racing car designed by Daimler-Benz AG for the 1934 Grand Prix season, in which new rules were introduced, and no championship was held. In 1935, the European Championship was resumed, and it was won by Rudolf Caracciola in a W25. In modified form, the W25 remained in use until 1937, when it was succeeded by the Mercedes-Benz W125.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Mercedes_Silberpfeil-W25_1934_Seitenansicht.jpg/260px-Mercedes_Silberpfeil-W25_1934_Seitenansicht.jpg
