23.41	African_Blackwood	Dalbergia melanoxylon	Dalbergia melanoxylon is a flowering plant in the family Fabaceae, native to seasonally dry regions of Africa from Senegal east to Eritrea and south to the Transvaal in South Africa. The tree is an important timber species in its native areas; it is used in the manufacture of musical instruments and fine furniture. Populations and genomic resources for genetic biodiversity maintenance in parts of its native range are threatened by overharvesting due to poor or absent conservation planning and by the species' low germination rates.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Status_iucn2.3_NT.svg/220px-Status_iucn2.3_NT.svg.png
