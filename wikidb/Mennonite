194.6	Mennonite	Mennonite	The Mennonites are an ethno-religious group based around the church communities of the Christian Anabaptist denominations named after the Frisian Menno Simons (1496â€“1561), who, through his writings, articulated and thereby formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders. The teachings of the Mennonites were founded on their belief in both the mission and ministry of Jesus Christ, which they held to with great conviction despite persecution by the various Roman Catholic and Protestant states. Rather than fight, the majority survived by fleeing to neighboring states where ruling families were tolerant of their radical belief in adult baptism. Over the years, Mennonites have become known as one of the historic peace churches because of their commitment to nonviolence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Spread_of_the_Anabaptists_1525-1550.png/220px-Spread_of_the_Anabaptists_1525-1550.png
