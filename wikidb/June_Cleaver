51.3	June_Cleaver	June Cleaver	June Evelyn Bronson Cleaver is a principal character in the American television sitcom Leave It to Beaver. June and her husband, Ward, are often invoked as the archetypal suburban parents of the 1950s. The couple are the parents of two sons, Wally and "Beaver". Wally is twelve years old and in the eighth grade when the series opens; Beaver is seven years old ("almost eight") and in the second grade. Episodes followed the escapades of Wally and Beaver and usually ended with a moral lesson delivered to the boys, but also often included reminders of childhood and minor lessons for the parents through the adventures of their boys.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Barbara_Billinglsey_June_Cleaver.jpg/220px-Barbara_Billinglsey_June_Cleaver.jpg
