60.1	Jack-o'-lantern	Jack-o'-lantern	A jack-o'-lantern is typically a carved pumpkin. It is associated chiefly with the holiday of Halloween and was named after the phenomenon of strange light flickering over peat bogs, called ignis fatuus or jack-o'-lantern. In a jack-o'-lantern, typically the top is cut off, and the inside flesh then scooped out; an image, usually a monstrous face, is carved onto the outside surface, and the lid replaced. It is typically seen during Halloween.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/aa/Pumpkins2009.jpg/200px-Pumpkins2009.jpg
