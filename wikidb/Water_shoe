2.20	Water_shoe	Water shoe	A water shoe is a type of footwear that are typically used for activities where the feet are likely to become wet, such as kayaking. Water shoes are made of mesh and have a hard sole used to prevent cuts and abrasions when walking in wet, rocky environments. Water shoes are also used to protect people's feet in waters with sharp-rocked floors or zebra mussels, in which case their primary purpose is not to keep the wearer's feet dry. In some areas such as the Finger Lakes, wearing water shoes has become essential due to the infestation of sharp-edged mussels.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Watershoe.jpg/220px-Watershoe.jpg
