71.5	Stonewall_Jackson	Stonewall Jackson	Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson (January 21, 1824 â€“ May 10, 1863) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War, and one of the best-known Confederate commanders after General Robert E. Lee. His military career includes the Valley Campaign of 1862 and his service as a corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E. Lee. Confederate pickets accidentally shot him at the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863; the general survived with the loss of an arm to amputation. However, he died of complications of pneumonia eight days later. His death was a severe setback for the Confederacy, affecting not only its military prospects, but also the morale of its army and of the general public.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Stonewall_Jackson.jpg/200px-Stonewall_Jackson.jpg
