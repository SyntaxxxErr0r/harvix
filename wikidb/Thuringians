2.00	Thuringians	Thuringii	The Thuringii or Toringi were a Germanic tribe which appeared late during the Völkerwanderung in the Harz Mountains of central Germania around 280, in a region which still bears their name to this day — Thuringia. They evidently filled a void left when the previous inhabitants — the Alamanni — migrated south to the region named after them, Alemannia. They may have been remnants of the Alemannic confederation, or simply another lesser tribe. Some have suggested that they were the remnants of the Hermanduri, that last part of whose name was corrupted (-thuri) and afterwards suffixed with -ing, meaning "descendants of (the duri)".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Roman_Empire_125.png/350px-Roman_Empire_125.png
