2.20	Transfatty_acids	Trans fat	Trans fat is the common name for unsaturated fat with trans-isomer (E-isomer) fatty acid(s). Because the term refers to the configuration of a double carbon-carbon bond, trans fats are sometimes monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, but never saturated. Trans fats are rare in living nature, but can occur in food production processes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Crisco_Cookbook_1912.jpg/220px-Crisco_Cookbook_1912.jpg
