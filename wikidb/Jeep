67.1	Jeep	Jeep	Jeep is an automobile marque of Chrysler, a multinational manufacturer in a global strategic alliance with Fiat. The first Willys Jeeps were produced in 1941 with the first civilian models in 1945, making it the oldest off-road vehicle and sport utility vehicle (SUV) brand. It inspired a number of other light utility vehicles, such as the Land Rover which is the second oldest 4-wheel-drive brand. The original Jeep vehicle that first appeared as the prototype Bantam BRC became the primary light 4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Army and Allies during World War II, as well as the postwar period. Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have since been created in other nations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Jeepnewlogo.svg/175px-Jeepnewlogo.svg.png
