103.1	Matter	Matter	Matter is anything that occupies space and has rest mass (or invariant mass). It is a general term for the substance of which all physical objects consist. Typically, matter includes atoms and other particles which have mass. Mass is said by some to be the amount of matter in an object and volume is the amount of space occupied by an object, but this definition confuses mass and matter, which are not the same. Different fields use the term in different and sometimes incompatible ways; there is no single agreed scientific meaning of the word "matter," even though the term "mass" is better-defined.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/DNA_chemical_structure.svg/350px-DNA_chemical_structure.svg.png
