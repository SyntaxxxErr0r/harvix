1.00	Running_martingale	Martingale (tack)	A martingale is any of several designs of tack that are used on horses to control head carriage. Martingales may be seen in a wide variety of equestrian disciplines, both riding and driving. Rules for their use vary widely; in some disciplines they are never used, others allow them for schooling but not in judged performance, and some organizations allow certain designs in competition.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Norfolk_Hunt_Horse_Show.jpg/220px-Norfolk_Hunt_Horse_Show.jpg
