56.6	Kairos	Kairos	Kairos () is an ancient Greek word meaning the right or opportune moment (the supreme moment). The ancient Greeks had two words for time, chronos and kairos. While the former refers to chronological or sequential time, the latter signifies a time in between, a moment of indeterminate time in which something special happens. What the special something is depends on who is using the word. While chronos is quantitative, kairos has a qualitative nature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Francesco_Salviati_005.jpg/220px-Francesco_Salviati_005.jpg
