56.1	Sugar_cane	Sugarcane	Sugarcane refers to any of six to 37 species (depending on which taxonomic system is used) of tall perennial grasses of the genus Saccharum (family Poaceae, tribe Andropogoneae). Native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia, they have stout jointed fibrous stalks that are rich in sugar, and measure two to six metres (6 to 19 feet) tall. All sugar cane species interbreed, and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Saccharum_officinarum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-125.jpg/220px-Saccharum_officinarum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-125.jpg
