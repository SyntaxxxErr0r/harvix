63.1	Cuyahoga_River	Cuyahoga River	The Cuyahoga River ( -ə--ə, or -ə--gə) is located in Northeast Ohio in the United States. Outside of Ohio, the river is most famous for being "the river that caught fire", helping to spur the environmental movement in the late 1960s. Native Americans called this winding water "Cuyahoga," which means "crooked river" in the Iroquois language.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Cuyahogarivermap.png/300px-Cuyahogarivermap.png
