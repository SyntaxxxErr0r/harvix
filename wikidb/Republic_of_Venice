It existed for over a millennium, from the late 7th century until 1797. It was formally known as the Most Serene Republic of Venice (Italian: , Venetian: or ) and is often referred to as La Serenissima, in reference to its title as one of the "Most Serene Republics". The Republic's modern reputation is widely based on its preference for economic supremacy over military might, despite its long history of war and conquest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Flag_of_Most_Serene_Republic_of_Venice.svg/125px-Flag_of_Most_Serene_Republic_of_Venice.svg.png
