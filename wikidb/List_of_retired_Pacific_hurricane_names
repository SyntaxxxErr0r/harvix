1.22	List_of_retired_Pacific_hurricane_names	List of retired Pacific hurricane names	This is a list of all Pacific hurricanes that have had their names retired. Hurricane names are retired by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in a meeting in the Spring of each year. Those hurricanes that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms that often become household names in the regions they affected. Storm names are retired following a request made at the WMO meeting by one or more of the countries affected by a hurricane. Eight tropical cyclone names have been retired since the start of tropical cyclone naming in the eastern Pacific Ocean, including four storms named by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. In addition, several names were removed from the naming list for various reasons other than retirement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Retired_Pacific_hurricane_tracks.png/300px-Retired_Pacific_hurricane_tracks.png
