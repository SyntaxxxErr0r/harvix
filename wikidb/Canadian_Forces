55.1	Canadian_Forces	Canadian Forces	The Canadian Forces (French: les Forces canadiennes; FC), officially the Canadian Armed Forces (French: Forces arm√©es canadiennes), are the unified armed forces of Canada, as constituted by the National Defence Act, which states: "The Canadian Forces are the armed forces of Her Majesty raised by Canada and consist of one Service called the Canadian Armed Forces." This single institution consists of the sea, land, and air environmental commands called the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), which together are overseen by the Armed Forces Council, chaired by the Chief of the Defence Staff. At the pinnacle of the command structure is the Commander-in-Chief, who is the reigning Canadian monarch, Elizabeth II, represented by the governor general.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Canadian_Forces_emblem.svg/200px-Canadian_Forces_emblem.svg.png
