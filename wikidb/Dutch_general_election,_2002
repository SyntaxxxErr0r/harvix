4.00	Dutch_general_election,_2002	Dutch general election, 2002	General elections were held in the Netherlands on 15 May 2002. The elections were amongst the most dramatic in Dutch history, not just in terms of the electoral results, as they was completely overshadowed by the assassination of politician Pim Fortuyn only nine days before election day. Fortuyn's party made a huge leap from nothing to 17% of the seats, making it the second largest party. Fortuyn had especially attacked immigration policies and also questioned many aspects of government by the previous 'purple' cabinets of Wim Kok, which he blamed for everything from crime to waiting lists in health services.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Balkenende_Dutch_politician_kabinet_Balkenende_IV.jpg/100px-Balkenende_Dutch_politician_kabinet_Balkenende_IV.jpg
