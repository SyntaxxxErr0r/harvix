The Golden Raspberry Awards, known as the Razzies, is an awards ceremony to recognize the worst in American film. According to current Razzies tradition the ceremony itself precedes the corresponding Academy Award function by one day. In 1988 comedian Bill Cosby became the first recipient to accept a Golden Raspberry Award, for the film Leonard Part 6, and received his award on a late night show on Fox. Paul Verhoeven became the first recipient to claim his award in person at the awards ceremony, when he accepted Worst Picture and Worst Director awards for the 1995 film Showgirls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Sandra_Bullock_at_2010_Razzies_adjusted.jpg/150px-Sandra_Bullock_at_2010_Razzies_adjusted.jpg
