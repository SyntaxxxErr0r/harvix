4.00	Tribute_To	Tribute To	Tribute To is an EP by My Morning Jacket lead singer Jim James (under the pseudonym Yim Yames), consisting entirely of George Harrison (and Beatles) covers. The EP was released as a digital download via his website, on July 7, 2009. The album was released as a CD on August 4, 2009. James recorded the album in December 2001 on a relative's eight-track reel-to-reel tape recorder, just days after Harrison's passing. Of the recording, James told Billboard Magazine that "I felt like I was in the weirdest head space when I did that EP... I felt really confused a lot of the time. I wanted to just do it and let it come out even if I messed stuff up. It's definitely not the tightest or most professional recording you're ever going to hear in your life but I like that. I think it lends it a more childish atmosphere."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/76/YimYamesTributeTo.jpg/220px-YimYamesTributeTo.jpg
