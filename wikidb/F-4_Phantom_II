54.6	F-4_Phantom_II	McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II	The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIN 1 is a tandem (two-seat), twin-engined, all-weather, long-range supersonic jet interceptor fighter/fighter-bomber originally developed for the United States Navy by McDonnell Aircraft. It first entered service in 1960 with the U.S. Navy. Proving highly adaptable, it was also adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force, and by the mid-1960s had become a major part of their respective air wings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/F-4B_VMFA-314_1968.jpg/300px-F-4B_VMFA-314_1968.jpg
