78.1	EU	European Union	The European Union is an economic and political union or confederation of 27 member states which are located primarily in Europe. The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by six countries in 1958. In the intervening years the EU has grown in size by the accession of new member states, and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993. The latest amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Flag_of_Europe.svg/125px-Flag_of_Europe.svg.png
