33.02	Great_Train_Robbery_(1963)	Great Train Robbery (1963)	At 5 a.m., Chief Superintendent Malcolm Fewtrell (1909â€“2005), head of the Buckinghamshire Police Crime Investigation Department , arrived at the abandoned postal carriages, the crime scene, where he supervised evidence-gathering. He then went to Cheddington Station where statements were taken from the driver and postal workers. A member of the gang had made the mistake of telling the postal staff not to move for half an hour and this suggested to the police that their hide-out could not be more than 35 miles away. It appeared, from interviews with the witnesses, that about 15 hooded men dressed in blue boiler suits had been involved, but little more could be gleaned.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/Sears_Crossing.JPG/220px-Sears_Crossing.JPG
