2.10	Maria_Francisca_of_Savoy	Maria Francisca of Savoy	Maria Francisca of Savoy (Marie Françoise Élisabeth; 21 June 1646 – 27 December 1683) was a Princess of Savoy and a Queen consort of Portugal. She was the younger daughter of Charles Amadeus, Duke of Nemours, and Élisabeth de Bourbon. Maria Francisca was actually the consort of two Portuguese kings. She first became Queen of Portugal at the age of 20 on the day of her marriage to Afonso VI of Portugal. Since the marriage was never consummated, she was able to obtain an annulment. On 28 March 1668, she married Afonso's brother, the Infante Peter, Duke of Beja, who was appointed prince regent the same year due to Afonso's perceived incompetence. Maria Francisca became Queen of Portugal for the second time when Peter succeeded his brother as Peter II in 1683. She herself died later that year.
