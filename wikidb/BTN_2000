2.10	BTN_2000	BTN 2000	BTN 2000 is an unreleased industrial remix album of Public Enemy tracks, following their 1998 He Got Game album. The group's attempt to make it available to fans online was blocked by their record distributor, PolyGram. This action resulted in the group's departure from that label and Def Jam, with whom PE had made music history in the late 1980s. The group's next album, There's a Poison Goin' On was released on the independent label Atomic Pop.
