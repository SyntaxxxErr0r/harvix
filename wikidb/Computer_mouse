132.1	Computer_mouse	Mouse (computing)	A mouse is a pointing device that functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. Physically, a mouse consists of an object held under one of the user's hands, with one or more buttons. It sometimes features other elements, such as "wheels", which allow the user to perform various system-dependent operations, or extra buttons or features that can add more control or dimensional input. The mouse's motion typically translates into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/3-Tastenmaus_Microsoft.jpg/233px-3-Tastenmaus_Microsoft.jpg
