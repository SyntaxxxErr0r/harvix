1.00	Siroopwafel	Stroopwafel	The stiff batter for the waffles is made from flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs. Medium sized balls of batter are put on the waffle iron. After the waffle has been baked, and while it's still warm, it's cut into halves. The warm filling, made from syrup, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon, is spread between the waffle halves, gluing them together.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Gaufre_biscuit.jpg/275px-Gaufre_biscuit.jpg
