66.7	Rosary	Rosary	The rosary (from Latin rosarium, meaning "rose garden") or "garland of roses" is a traditional Catholic devotion. The term denotes the prayer beads used to count the series of prayers that make up the rosary. The prayers consist of repeated sequences of the Lord's Prayer followed by ten prayings of the Hail Mary and a single praying of "Glory Be to the Father" and is sometimes accompanied by the Fatima Prayer; each of these sequences is known as a decade. The praying of each decade is accompanied by meditation on one of the Mysteries of the Rosary, which recall the life of Jesus Christ.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Rosary_2006-01-16.jpg/150px-Rosary_2006-01-16.jpg
