7.40	Classical_Marxism	Classical Marxism	Karl Heinrich Marx (May 5, 1818, Trier, Germany â€“ March 14, 1883, London) was an immensely influential German philosopher, political economist, and socialist revolutionary. Marx addressed a wide range of issues, including alienation and exploitation of the worker, the capitalist mode of production and historical materialism, although he is most famous for his analysis of history in terms of class struggles, summed up in the opening line of the introduction to the Communist Manifesto: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." The influence of his ideas, already popular during his life, was given added impetus by the victory of the Russian Bolsheviks in the 1917 October Revolution, and there are few parts of the world which were not significantly touched by Marxian ideas in the course of the twentieth century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Marx4.jpg/100px-Marx4.jpg
