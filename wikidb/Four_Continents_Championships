The International Skating Union established it in 1999 to provide skaters representing non-European countries with a similar competition to the much older European Figure Skating Championships and a chance to win prize money. The four continents of the event's name refer to the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Oceania (four of the continents represented in the Olympic rings, omitting Europe). Skaters compete in the categories of men's singles, ladies singles, pairs, and ice dancing.
