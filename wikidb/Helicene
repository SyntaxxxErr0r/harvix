8.20	Helicene	Helicene	Helicenes in organic chemistry are ortho-condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds in which benzene rings or other aromatics are angularly annulated to give helically-shaped molecules. The chemistry of helicenes has attracted continuing attention because of their unique structural, spectral, and optical features.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Hexahelicene-from-xtal-3D-vdW.png/150px-Hexahelicene-from-xtal-3D-vdW.png
