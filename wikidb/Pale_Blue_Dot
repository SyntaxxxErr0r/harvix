99.7	Pale_Blue_Dot	Pale Blue Dot	The Pale Blue Dot is a photograph of planet Earth taken in 1990 by the Voyager 1 spacecraft from a record distance of about kilometers ( miles) from Earth, as part of the solar system Family Portrait series of images. In the photograph, Earth is shown as a tiny dot (0.12 pixel in size) against the vastness of space. The Voyager 1 spacecraft, which had completed its primary mission and was leaving the Solar System, was commanded by NASA to turn its camera around and to take a photograph of Earth across a great expanse of space, at the request of Carl Sagan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Pale_Blue_Dot.png/300px-Pale_Blue_Dot.png
