The league was created when Rugby Canada decided to disband the Rugby Canada Super League (RCSL) and replace it with a new under-20 league. The league consists of 13 teams, and are broken up into 4 divisions; Pacific, Prairie, Central, and Atlantic. It is expected that 3 more teams will join the league in 2010.
