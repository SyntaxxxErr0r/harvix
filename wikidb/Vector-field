1.01	Vector-field	Vector field	In vector calculus, a vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in a subset of Euclidean space. A vector field in the plane for instance can be visualized as an arrow, with a given magnitude and direction, attached to each point in the plane. Vector fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout space, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it changes from point to point.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/VectorField.svg/250px-VectorField.svg.png
