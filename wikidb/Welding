64.5	Welding	Welding	Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing coalescence. This is often done by melting the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to become a strong joint, with pressure sometimes used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce the weld. This is in contrast with soldering and brazing, which involve melting a lower-melting-point material between the workpieces to form a bond between them, without melting the workpieces.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/SMAW.welding.af.ncs.jpg/220px-SMAW.welding.af.ncs.jpg
