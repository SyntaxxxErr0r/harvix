63.1	Evaporative_cooler	Evaporative cooler	An evaporative cooler (also swamp cooler, desert cooler, and wet air cooler) is a device that cools air through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling works by employing water's large enthalpy of vaporization. The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor, which requires much less energy than refrigeration. In extremely dry climates, it also has the added benefit of conditioning the air with more moisture for the comfort of occupants. Unlike refrigeration, it requires a water source, and must continually consume water to operate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Evaporative_cooler%2C_CO%2C_IMG_5681.JPG/220px-Evaporative_cooler%2C_CO%2C_IMG_5681.JPG
