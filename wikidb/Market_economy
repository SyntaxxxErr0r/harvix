62.9	Market_economy	Market economy	A market economy is an economy in which decisions regarding investment, production and distribution are based on supply and demand and the prices of goods and services are determined in a free price system. This is contrasted with a planned economy, where investment and production decisions are embodied in a plan of production. Market economies can range from hypothetical laissez-faire and free market variants to regulated markets and interventionist variants. Most existing market economies include a degree of economic planning or state-directed activity and are thus classified as mixed economies.
