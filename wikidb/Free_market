187.0	Free_market	Free market	A free market is a market where prices are determined by supply and demand. Free markets contrast with controlled markets in which prices, supply or demand is directly controlled. Various economic theories require specific properties of free markets, for example, a perfect market with perfect information and perfect competition. Regulation which does not affect these specific properties can be in place without disqualifying the market as free under supply and demand.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Red_flag_waving.svg/100px-Red_flag_waving.svg.png
