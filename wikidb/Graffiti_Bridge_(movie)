It is a sequel to his first film, Purple Rain, though notorious for its relatively low quality and poor performance at the box-office. However, like Purple Rain, it was accompanied by a soundtrack album also entitled Graffiti Bridge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Graffiti_Bridge_%28film%29.jpg/220px-Graffiti_Bridge_%28film%29.jpg
