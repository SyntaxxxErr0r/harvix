2.00	Discontinuity_(mathematics)	Classification of discontinuities	Continuous functions are of utmost importance in mathematics and applications. However, not all functions are continuous. If a function is not continuous at a point in its domain, one says that it has a discontinuity there. The set of all points of discontinuity of a function may be a discrete set, a dense set, or even the entire domain of the function.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/APEC_Police_Helicopter%2C_Opera_House%2C_2_Sept_2007.JPG/220px-APEC_Police_Helicopter%2C_Opera_House%2C_2_Sept_2007.JPG
