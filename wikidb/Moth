58.0	Moth	Moth	A moth is an insect closely related to the butterfly, both being of the order Lepidoptera. Moths form the majority of this order; there are thought to be about 160,000 species of moth (nearly ten times the number of species of butterfly), with thousands of species yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are crepuscular and diurnal species.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Emperor_Gum_Moth.jpg/200px-Emperor_Gum_Moth.jpg
