92.1	Parent	Parent	A parent (from Latin: parÄ“ns = parent) is a caretaker of the offspring in their own species. In humans, a parent is of a child (where "child" refers to offspring, not necessarily age). Children can have one or more parents, but they must have two biological parents. Biological parents consist of the male who sired the child and the female who gave birth to the child. In all human societies, the biological mother and father are both responsible for raising their young. However, some parents may not be biologically related to their children. An adoptive parent is one who nurtures and raises the offspring of the biological parents but is not actually biologically related to the child. Children without adoptive parents can be raised by their grandparents or other family members.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Under_the_horse_chestnut_tree2.jpg/250px-Under_the_horse_chestnut_tree2.jpg
