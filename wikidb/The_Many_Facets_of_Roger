3.00	The_Many_Facets_of_Roger	The Many Facets of Roger	The Many Facets of Roger was the debut solo project by Dayton, Ohio-based funk visionary Roger Troutman, released a year after the singer made his debut as lead frontman of his family-based funk group, Zapp, and the group had made their breakthrough with the funk hit "More Bounce to the Ounce". The album went platinum based on the R&amp;B successes of "So Ruff, So Tuff" and his cover of Marvin Gaye's "I Heard It through the Grapevine". In the album, Troutman featured two instrumentals, "A Chunk of Sugar" and "Blue (A Tribute to the Blues)", which was recorded inside Detroit's United Sound Studios. Roger's brothers and his cohorts in Zapp, Larry, Lester and Terry also helped to contribute to the solo release.
