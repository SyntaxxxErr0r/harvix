3.01	Kurtis_Blow_(album)	Kurtis Blow (album)	The album Kurtis Blow was rapper Kurtis Blow's self-titled debut, released in 1980. It includes the famous song "The Breaks", that was often sampled later in hip-hop records, mainly for its introduction made by Blow's a cappella vocal, and for the drum break, giving a wordplay dimension to the title. "Rappin' Blow, Pt. 2" was issued as a single, that had a "do-it-yourself" B-side, the instrumental version. "Takin' Care of Business" is one of the first hip hop and rock'n'roll cross over attempts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/Kurtisblowalbum.jpg/220px-Kurtisblowalbum.jpg
