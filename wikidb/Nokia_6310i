7.42	Nokia_6310i	Nokia 6310i	The Nokia 6310i is a mobile phone from Nokia first introduced at the CeBIT fair in March 2002 with sales starting later that year and discontinued in late 2005. It was primarily marketed as a business phone and for some years was the dominant GSM device in the corporate world. It was the successor to the 6310 and 6210 (2000) which themselves were preceded by the 6150 and 6110 in the late 1990s. Accessories (such as batteries) can generally be swapped amongst all these models. This phone has been (and still is) very popular for its robustness, simplicity and long battery life years after being discontinued as a product. The model is basically the same as the earlier 6310 with the addition of tri-band reception, Java and a blue LCD Screen (as opposed to the earlier green).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Nokia_6310i.jpg/250px-Nokia_6310i.jpg
