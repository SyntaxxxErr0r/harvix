13.30	Bosnian_pyramid	Bosnian pyramids	The term Bosnian pyramids has been used for a cluster of natural geological formations sometimes known as flatirons near the Bosnian town of Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo. The hill named Visoƒçica became the focus of international attention in October 2005 following a news-media campaign promoting the idea that they are human-made and the largest ancient pyramids on Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/1973_Visoko.jpg/300px-1973_Visoko.jpg
