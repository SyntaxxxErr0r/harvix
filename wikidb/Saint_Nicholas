170.6	Saint_Nicholas	Saint Nicholas	Saint Nicholas in Lycia. Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nikolaos the Wonderworker (, ). He had a reputation for secret gift-giving, such as putting coins in the shoes of those who left them out for him, and thus became the model for Santa Claus, whose modern name comes from the Dutch Sinterklaas, itself from a series of elisions and corruptions of the transliteration of "Saint Nikolaos". His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints. In 1087, his relics were furtively translated to Bari, in southeastern Italy; for this reason, he is also known as Nikolaos of Bari. His feastday is 6 December .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Nikola_from_1294.jpg/242px-Nikola_from_1294.jpg
