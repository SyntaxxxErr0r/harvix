1.00	Central_Westchester_Parkway	Central Westchester Parkway	The Central Westchester Parkway is a 1.01-mile (1.63 km), four-lane parkway in Westchester County, New York, in the United States. It runs from exit 7 of the Cross-Westchester Expressway (Interstate 287 or I-287) to the Taconic State Parkway via New York State Route 22 (NY 22). The road has two intermediate exits and is maintained by Westchester County as County Route 150. Until 2011, the exit off I-287 signed it only as "To Taconic Parkway, North White Plains." However, the sign now calls the parkway by its little-known name.
