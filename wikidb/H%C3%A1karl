61.5	H%C3%A1karl	Hákarl	Hákarl or kæstur hákarl (Icelandic for "shark") is a food from Iceland. It is a Greenland- or basking shark which has been cured with a particular fermentation process and hung to dry for four to five months. Hákarl is often referred to as an acquired taste and has a very particular ammonia-rich smell and fishy taste, similar to very strong cheese slathered in ammonia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Hakarl_near_Bjarnah%C3%B6fn_in_Iceland.JPG/250px-Hakarl_near_Bjarnah%C3%B6fn_in_Iceland.JPG
