1.00	Fort_Paskoya	Fort Paskoya	Fort Paskoya or Paskoyac or Pasquia was a French fort and trading post near the mouth of the Saskatchewan River. Along with Fort Bourbon, Fort Dauphin (Manitoba) and Fort La Reine is was built by the Vérendryes to control the chain of lakes west of Lake Winnipeg. It also diverted furs away from the Hudson's Bay Company since the western Indians would normally pass this point on their way to Hudson Bay. During the winter of 1741-42, the western military commander La Vérendrye decided to build a fort at the site chosen by his son Louis-Joseph, the Chevalier, at Cedar Lake. This had been mapped by Louis-Joseph in 1740. This was the first Fort Paskoya, situated on a small island, west of Cedar Lake, Manitoba, toward the discharge of the Saskatchewan River near the head of the delta of the river. It was named after a Cree word for narrows, or after the Opaskwayak Cree Nation, whom the explorers encountered. "Paskoyac" was also an old name for the Saskatchewan River.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Verendrye-map.gif/400px-Verendrye-map.gif
