54.9	Storm_botnet	Storm botnet	The Storm botnet or Storm worm botnet (not to be confused with StormBot, which is a TCL script that is not malicious) is a remotely controlled network of "zombie" computers (or "botnet") that have been linked by the Storm Worm, a Trojan horse spread through e-mail spam. Some have estimated that by September 2007 the Storm botnet was running on anywhere from 1 million to 50 million computer systems. Other sources have placed the size of the botnet to be around 250,000 to 1 million compromised systems. More conservatively, one network security analyst claims to have developed software that has crawled the botnet and estimates that it controls 160,000 infected computers. The Storm botnet was first identified around January 2007, with the Storm worm at one point accounting for 8% of all malware on Microsoft Windows computers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Circle_of_spam.svg/300px-Circle_of_spam.svg.png
