66.5	Cremation	Cremation	Cremation is the use of high-temperature burning, vaporization, and oxidation to reduce dead animal bodies, including human ones, to basic chemical compounds, such as gases and dry bone fragments. Cremation may serve as a funeral or post-funeral rite that is an alternative to the interment of an intact body in a casket. Cremated remains, which do not constitute a health risk, may be buried or interred in memorial sites or cemeteries, or they may be legally retained by relatives and dispersed in various ways.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Ubud_Cremation_4.jpg/220px-Ubud_Cremation_4.jpg
