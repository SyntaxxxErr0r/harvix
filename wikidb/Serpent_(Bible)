26.23	Serpent_(Bible)	Serpent (Bible)	Serpent, or snake occurs in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. The symbol of a serpent or snake played important roles in religious and cultural life of ancient Egypt, Canaan, Mesopotamia, and Greece. The serpent was a symbol of evil power and chaos from the underworld as well as a symbol of fertility, life, and healing. Nahash, Hebrew for "snake", is also associated with divination, including the verb-form meaning to practice divination or fortune-telling. In the Hebrew Bible, Nahash occurs in the Torah to identify the serpent in Eden. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, it is also used in conjunction with saraph to describe vicious serpents in the wilderness. Tanniyn, a form of dragon-monster, also occurs throughout the Hebrew Bible. As in the Exodus, the staffs of Moses and Aaron are turned into serpents, a nahash for Moses, a tanniyn for Aaron. In the New Testament, the Book of Revelation makes use of Serpent several times to identify Satan, the Dragon an ancient Serpent (Rev.12:9; 20:2).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/France_Paris_Notre-Dame-Adam_and_Eve.jpg/250px-France_Paris_Notre-Dame-Adam_and_Eve.jpg
