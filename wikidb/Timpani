60.1	Timpani	Timpani	Timpani, or kettledrums, are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a skin called a head stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper. They are played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century. Today, they are used in many types of musical ensembles including concert, marching, and even some rock bands.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/USAFE_Band_timpanist.jpg/250px-USAFE_Band_timpanist.jpg
