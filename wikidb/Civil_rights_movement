65.3	Civil_rights_movement	Civil rights movement	The civil rights movement was a worldwide political movement for equality before the law occurring between approximately 1950 and 1980. In many situations it took the form of campaigns of civil resistance aimed at achieving change by nonviolent forms of resistance. In some situations it was accompanied, or followed, by civil unrest and armed rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not fully achieve their goals although, the efforts of these movements did lead to improvements in the legal rights of previously oppressed groups of people.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Bloody_Sunday_Mural_Bogside_2004_SMC.jpg/230px-Bloody_Sunday_Mural_Bogside_2004_SMC.jpg
