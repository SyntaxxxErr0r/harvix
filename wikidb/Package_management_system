52.7	Package_management_system	Package management system	A package, for package managers, denotes a specific set of files bundled with the appropriate metadata for use by a package manager. This can be confusing, as some programming languages often use the word "package" as a specific form of software library. Furthermore, that software library can be distributed in a package of files bundled for a package manager.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Synaptic_Package_Manager.png/350px-Synaptic_Package_Manager.png
