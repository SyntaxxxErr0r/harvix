1.00	Court_Street_(Boston,_Massachusetts)	Court Street (Boston, Massachusetts)	Court Street (est. July 4, 1788) is located in the Financial District of Boston, Massachusetts. Prior to 1788, it was called Prison Lane (1634–1708) and then Queen Street (1708–1788). In the 19th century it extended beyond its current length, to Bowdoin Square. In the 1960s most of Court Street was demolished to make way for the construction of Government Center. The remaining street extends a few blocks, near the Old State House on State Street.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Court_Street_Boston_2009_924.JPG/150px-Court_Street_Boston_2009_924.JPG
