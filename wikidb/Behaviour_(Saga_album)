2.00	Behaviour_(Saga_album)	Behaviour (Saga album)	Behaviour is the sixth studio album by the Canadian progressive rock band Saga, and was originally released in 1985, two years after the moderately successful Heads or Tales. Behaviour was itself successful, and managed to outsell its 1983 predecessor thanks to the strong performance of the single "What Do I Know".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Behaviour_%28Saga_album%29.jpg/220px-Behaviour_%28Saga_album%29.jpg
