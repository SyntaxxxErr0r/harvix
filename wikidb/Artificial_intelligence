AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/GFO_taxonomy_tree.png/220px-GFO_taxonomy_tree.png
