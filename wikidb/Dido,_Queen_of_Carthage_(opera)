1.00	Dido,_Queen_of_Carthage_(opera)	Dido, Queen of Carthage (opera)	Dido, Queen of Carthage was an opera in three acts by Stephen Storace. Its English libretto by Prince Hoare was adapted from Metastasio's 1724 libretto, Didone abbandonata , which had been set by many composers. Storace's opera premiered on 23 May 1792 at The King's Theatre in London combined with a performance of his masque, Neptune's Prophecy. The story is based on that of Dido and Aeneas in the fourth book of Virgil's Aeneid. The opera was not a success and was never revived after its original run of performances. The score has been lost.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Stephen_Storace.jpg/220px-Stephen_Storace.jpg
