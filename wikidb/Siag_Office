2.00	Siag_Office	Siag Office	Siag Office is a tightly integrated, free software office package for Unix-like operating systems. It consists of the spreadsheet SIAG ("Scheme In A Grid"), the word processor Pathetic Writer (PW), the animation program Egon Animator, the text editor XedPlus, the file manager Xfiler and the previewer Gvu. It is known to be extremely light-weight and hence to run on very old (such as i486, 16MB systems) systems reasonably well. Because it is kept light-weight, the software lacks many of the features of office suites like LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org or Microsoft Office.
