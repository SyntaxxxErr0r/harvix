1.00	Bull_polishing	Bull polishing	Bull polishing, bulling, spit polishing or spit shining refers to a method for polishing leather products in such a way as to give an extremely high shine effect. It is commonly used in the military as a traditional method of presenting leather accessories (such as a Sam Browne belt) and boots for inspection. The finished effect should leave the surface of the leather as reflective as a mirror.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Bull_polished_drill_boots.JPG/220px-Bull_polished_drill_boots.JPG
