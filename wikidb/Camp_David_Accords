78.6	Camp_David_Accords	Camp David Accords	The Camp David Accords were signed by Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on September 17, 1978, following thirteen days of secret negotiations at Camp David. The two framework agreements were signed at the White House, and were witnessed by United States President Jimmy Carter. The second of these frameworks, A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel, led directly to the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, and resulted in Sadat and Begin sharing the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. Little progress was achieved on the first framework however, A Framework for Peace in the Middle East, which dealt with the Palestinian territories.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Begin%2C_Carter_and_Sadat_at_Camp_David_1978.jpg/220px-Begin%2C_Carter_and_Sadat_at_Camp_David_1978.jpg
