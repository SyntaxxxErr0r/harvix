79.6	Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder	Helmuth von Moltke the Elder	Helmuth Karl Bernhard Graf von Moltke (26 October 1800, Parchim, Mecklenburg-Schwerin â€“ 24 April 1891) was a German Field Marshal. The chief of staff of the Prussian Army for thirty years, he is regarded as one of the great strategists of the latter 19th century, and the creator of a new, more modern method of directing armies in the field. He is often referred to as Moltke the Elder to distinguish him from his nephew Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke, who commanded the German Army at the outbreak of World War I.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Helmuth_Karl_Bernhard_von_Moltke.jpg
