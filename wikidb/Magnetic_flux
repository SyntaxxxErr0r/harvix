30.37	Magnetic_flux	Magnetic flux	In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the magnetic flux (often denoted Φ or ΦB) through a surface is the component of the B field passing through that surface. The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb) (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the CGS unit is the maxwell. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils and electronics that evaluates the change of voltage in the measuring coils to calculate the magnetic flux.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg/220px-VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png
