61.0	Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation	Newton's law of universal gravitation	Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. (Separately it was shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers.) This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Newton called induction. It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("the Principia"), first published on 5 July 1687. (When Newton's book was presented in 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him â€“ see History section below.) In modern language, the law states the following:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Gravitation.gif/190px-Gravitation.gif
