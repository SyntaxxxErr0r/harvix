35.88	Economy_of_Europe	Economy of Europe	The economy of Europe comprises more than 731 million people in 48 different states. Like other continents, the wealth of Europe's states varies, although the poorest are well above the poorest states of other continents in terms of GDP and living standards. The difference in wealth across Europe can be seen in a rough East-West divide. Whilst some European states have high GDPs and living standards (Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Andorra, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland), many European economies are still developing (Moldova, Turkey or Ukraine). Throughout this article "Europe" and derivatives of the word are taken to include selected states whose territory is only partly in Europe – such as Turkey (depending on a definition - whole country or just Thrace), Azerbaijan (Caucasus), and the Russian Federation (its European part to Ural Mountains) – and states that are geographically in Asia, bordering Europe and culturally adherent to the continent – such as Armenia, Georgia, and Cyprus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Europe_gdp_map-1-.png/220px-Europe_gdp_map-1-.png
