80.5	Diacritic	Diacritic	A diacritic (also diacritical mark, diacritical point, diacritical sign from ancient Greek διά (dia, through) and κρίνω (krinein, to separate) is a glyph added to a letter, or basic glyph. The term derives from the Greek διακριτικός (diakritikós, "distinguishing"). Diacritic is both an adjective and a noun, whereas diacritical is only an adjective. Some diacritical marks, such as the acute ( ´ ) and grave ( ` ) are often called accents. Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Example_of_biblical_Hebrew_trope.svg/350px-Example_of_biblical_Hebrew_trope.svg.png
