60.7	Local_Exchange_Trading_Systems	Local exchange trading system	Local exchange trading systems (LETS), also known as LETSystems, are locally initiated, democratically organised, not-for-profit community enterprises that provide a community information service and record transactions of members exchanging goods and services by using the currency of locally created LETS Credits. In some places, e.g. Toronto, the scheme has been called the Local Employment and Trading System. In New South Wales, Australia, they were known as Local Energy Transfer Systems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Claudius_II_coin_%28colourised%29.png/100px-Claudius_II_coin_%28colourised%29.png
