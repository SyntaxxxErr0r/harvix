1.00	Bono_state	Bonoman	Bonoman (Bono State) was a trading state created by the Abron people, which culminated in bringing wealth to the Akan people. Bonoman was a Middle Ages Akan Empire in what is now the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana and eastern Ivory Coast. It is generally accepted as the origin of the subgroups of the Akan people who migrated out of the state at various times to create new Akan states in search of gold. The gold trade, which started to boom in Bonoman as early in the 12th century, was the genesis of Akan power and wealth in the region, beginning in the Middle Ages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Akan_face.jpg/250px-Akan_face.jpg
