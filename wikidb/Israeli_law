The Israeli legal system is based in common law, which also incorporates facets of civil law. Like the United Kingdom, Israel does not have a formal Constitution, despite the assertion in the Israeli Declaration of Independence that one would be written. Statutes enacted by the Knesset, particularly the Basic Laws of Israel and German civil law, religious law (Jewish Halakha and Muslim Sharia; mostly pertaining in the area of family law), and British common law. The Israeli courts have been influenced in recent years by American Law and Canadian Law and to a lesser extent by Continental Law (mostly from Germany).
