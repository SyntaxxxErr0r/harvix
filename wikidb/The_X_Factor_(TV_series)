54.2	The_X_Factor_(TV_series)	The X Factor (TV series)	The X Factor is a television music competition franchise created by Simon Cowell. It originated in the United Kingdom, where it was devised as a replacement for Pop Idol. It is now held in various countries, which pits contestants against each other. These contestants are aspiring pop singers drawn from public auditions. The programmes are produced by executive producer Simon Cowell and his company SYCOtv. The "X Factor" of the title refers to the undefinable "something" that makes for star quality. The prize is usually a recording contract, in addition to the publicity that appearance in the later stages of the show itself generates, not only for the winner but also for other highly ranked contestants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/86/XFactorTitles.jpg/300px-XFactorTitles.jpg
