2.63	Sydney_Entertainment_Centre	Sydney Entertainment Centre	The Sydney Entertainment Centre is a multi-purpose venue, located in Haymarket, Sydney, Australia. It opened in May 1983, to replace Sydney Stadium, which had been demolished to make way for a new railway. The centre is currently owned by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, which administers the neighbouring Darling Harbour area, and managed under a lease. It is one of Sydney's larger concert venues, licenced to accommodate over 13,000 people as a conventional theatre or 8,000 as a theatre-in-the-round. The centre's only regular tenant is the Sydney Kings who play in the National Basketball League. The SEC, known as the "Kingdome" during Kings home games has a capacity of 10,517 for basketball.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Sydney_Entertinment_Centre.jpg/250px-Sydney_Entertinment_Centre.jpg
