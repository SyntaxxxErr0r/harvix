73.4	Margin_of_error	Margin of error	The margin of error is a statistic expressing the amount of random sampling error in a survey's results. The larger the margin of error, the less faith one should have that the poll's reported results are close to the "true" figures; that is, the figures for the whole population. Margin of error occurs whenever a population is incompletely sampled.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/Marginoferror95.PNG/400px-Marginoferror95.PNG
