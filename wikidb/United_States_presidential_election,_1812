It featured an intriguing competition between incumbent Democratic-Republican President James Madison and a dissident Democratic-Republican, DeWitt Clinton, nephew of Madison's late Vice President. The Federalist opposition threw their support behind Clinton. Nonetheless, Madison was re-elected with 50.4 percent of the popular vote, making the 1812 election the closest up to that point in history.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/James_Madison.jpg/161px-James_Madison.jpg
