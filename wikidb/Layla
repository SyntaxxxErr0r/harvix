62.2	Layla	Layla	"Layla" is a song written by Eric Clapton and Jim Gordon, originally released by their blues rock band Derek and the Dominos, as the thirteenth track from their album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (December 1970). It is considered one of rock music's definitive love songs, featuring an unmistakable guitar figure played by Eric Clapton and Duane Allman, and a piano coda that comprises the second half of the song. Its famously contrasting movements were composed separately by Clapton and Gordon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/Layla_%28Derek_and_the_Dominoes%29_coverart.jpg/220px-Layla_%28Derek_and_the_Dominoes%29_coverart.jpg
