59.6	Romansh_language	Romansh language	Romansh (also spelled Romansch, Rumants(c)h, or Romanche; Romansh: rumantsch/rumauntsch/romontsch/rumàntsch; German: Rätoromanisch; Italian: Romancio) is one of the four national languages of Switzerland, along with German, Italian and French. It is one of the Rhaeto-Romance languages, descended from the Vulgar Latin spoken by Roman era occupiers of the region, and as such is closely related to French, Occitan, and Lombard, as well as the other Romance languages to a lesser extent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Romontsch_Trun.jpg/200px-Romontsch_Trun.jpg
