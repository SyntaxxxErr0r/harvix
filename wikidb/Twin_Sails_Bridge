The bridge will provide a second road link from Poole town centre to Hamworthy. The intention is that the bridge will allow development of four major sites, two in the town centre and two in Hamworthy, including the old power station which was closed in 1988.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Twin_sails_bridge.jpg/220px-Twin_sails_bridge.jpg
