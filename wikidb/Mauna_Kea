51.0	Mauna_Kea	Mauna Kea	Mauna Kea is a volcano on the island of Hawaii. Standing 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level, its peak is the highest point in the U.S. state of Hawaii. However, much of the mountain is below sea level; when measured from its oceanic base, Mauna Kea stands at more than 10,200 m (33,500 ft), significantly taller than the elevation of Mount Everest above sea level (Everest only rises an average of about 4,150 m/13,615 ft above its own base). Mauna Kea is about two million years old, and thus passed the most active shield stage of life hundreds of thousands of years ago. In its current post-shield state, its lava is more viscous, resulting in a steeper profile. Late volcanism has also given it a much smoother appearance than its neighboring volcanoes: contributing factors include the construction of cinder cones, the decentralization of its rift zones, the glaciation on its peak, and the weathering effects of the prevailing trade winds. Mauna Kea last erupted 4,600 years ago. According to the USGS, as of January 2012, the Volcanic-Alert Level is "Normal".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Mauna_Kea_from_the_ocean.jpg/280px-Mauna_Kea_from_the_ocean.jpg
