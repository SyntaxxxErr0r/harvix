67.0	Jeanne_Calment	Jeanne Calment	Jeanne Louise Calment (French pronunciation: ; 21 February 1875 â€“ 4 August 1997) was a French supercentenarian who had the longest confirmed human life span in history, living to the age of 122 years, 164 days. She lived in Arles, France, for her entire life, and outlived both her daughter and grandson. She became especially well known from the age of 113, when the centenary of Vincent van Gogh's visit brought reporters to Arles. She entered the Guinness Book of Records in 1988, and on 17 October 1995 she became the oldest person ever, having surpassed the (now discounted) case of Shigechiyo Izumi of Japan. She became the last living documented person born in the 1870s when the Japanese supercentenarian Tane Ikai (born 1879) died on 12 July 1995, and was thence, from that date, more than five years older than any other living human being until her death over two years later; in total she outlived no fewer than 329 undisputedly verified supercentenarians.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/Jeanne-Calment-1996.jpg/220px-Jeanne-Calment-1996.jpg
