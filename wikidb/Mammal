172.2	Mammal	Mammal	Mammals are members of class Mammalia ( ), air-breathing vertebrate animals characterised by the possession of endothermy, hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands functional in mothers with young. Most mammals also possess sweat glands and specialised teeth, and the largest group of mammals, the placentals, have a placenta which feeds the offspring during gestation. The mammalian brain, with its characteristic neocortex, regulates endothermic and circulatory systems, the latter featuring red blood cells lacking nuclei and a large, four-chambered heart maintaining the very high metabolism rate they have. Mammals range in size from the 30â€“40 millimeter (1- to 1.5-inch) bumblebee bat to the 33-meter (108-foot) blue whale.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Mammal_Diversity_2011.png/275px-Mammal_Diversity_2011.png
