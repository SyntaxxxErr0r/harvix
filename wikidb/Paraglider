12.22	Paraglider	Paragliding	Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a hollow fabric wing whose shape is formed by its suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/TegelbergParaglider_gobeirne.jpg/220px-TegelbergParaglider_gobeirne.jpg
