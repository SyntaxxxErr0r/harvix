7.30	A5_paper_size	ISO 216	ISO 216 specifies international standard (ISO) paper sizes used in most countries in the world today. It defines the "A" and "B" series of paper sizes, including A4, the most commonly available size. Two supplementary standards, ISO 217 and ISO 269, define related paper sizes; the ISO 269 "C" series is commonly listed alongside the A and B sizes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Comparison_paper_sizes.svg/200px-Comparison_paper_sizes.svg.png
