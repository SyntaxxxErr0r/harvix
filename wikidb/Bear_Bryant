59.2	Bear_Bryant	Bear Bryant	Paul William "Bear" Bryant (September 11, 1913 – January 26, 1983) was an American college football player and coach. He was best known as the longtime head coach of the University of Alabama football team. During his 25-year tenure as Alabama's head coach, he amassed six national championships and thirteen conference championships. Upon his retirement in 1982, he held the record for most wins as head coach in collegiate football history with 323 wins, a record broken by John Gagliardi in 1996. Bryant's mark has since also been surpassed by his longtime friend Joe Paterno, by Eddie Robinson, and by Bobby Bowden. At the University of Alabama, the Paul W. Bryant Museum, Paul W. Bryant Hall, Paul W. Bryant Drive and Bryant–Denny Stadium are all named in his honor. He was also known for his trademark black and white houndstooth or gingham hat, deep voice, casually leaning up against the goal post during pre-game warmups, and frequently holding his rolled-up game plan while on the sidelines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/Bear_Bryant.jpg/220px-Bear_Bryant.jpg
