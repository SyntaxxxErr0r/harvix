93.0	Gaia_(mythology)	Gaia (mythology)	Gaia ( or ; from Ancient Greek "land" or "earth"; also Gæa, Gaea, or Gea; Koine Greek: Γῆ) was the primordial Earth-goddess in ancient Greek religion. Gaia was the great mother of all: the heavenly gods and Titans were descended from her union with Uranus (the sky), the sea-gods from her union with Pontus (the sea), the Giants from her mating with Tartarus (the hell-pit) and mortal creatures were sprung or born from her earthy flesh. The earliest reference to her is Mycenaean Greek Linear B ma-ka (transliterated as ma-ga), "Mother Gaia."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Feuerbach_Gaea.jpg/200px-Feuerbach_Gaea.jpg
