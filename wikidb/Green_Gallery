7.00	Green_Gallery	Green Gallery	The Green Gallery was an art gallery that operated between 1960 and 1965 and was located at 15 West 57th Street in Manhattan, New York, United States. The director of the gallery was Richard Bellamy (1927â€“1998), and it was one of the first uptown galleries to show the work of the downtown New York avant-garde. During the late 1950s and early 1960s the downtown New York art world's avant-garde circle was generally located around the 10th Street Galleries and the Green Gallery began to show many 10th Street artists uptown. Searching for the best kinetic metaphor to describe Richard Bellamy's contribution to his art practice, Green Gallery opening artist Mark di Suvero famously told his dealer of 38 years, "You've been (springboard? (wings?) (slingshot?) to my art."
