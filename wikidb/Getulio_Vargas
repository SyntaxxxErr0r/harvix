12.23	Getulio_Vargas	Getúlio Vargas	Getúlio Dornelles Vargas (Portuguese pronunciation: ; 19 April 1882 – 24 August 1954) served as President of Brazil, first as dictator, from 1930 to 1945, and in a democratically elected term from 1951 until his suicide in 1954. Vargas led Brazil for 18 years, the most for any President, and second in Brazilian history only to Emperor Pedro II among heads of government. He favored nationalism, industrialization, centralization, social welfare and populism – for the latter, Vargas won the nickname "O Pai dos Pobres" (Portuguese for "The Father of the Poor"). Despite his promotion of workers' rights, Vargas was a staunch anti-communist.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Get%C3%BAlio_Vargas_-_retrato_oficial_de_1930.JPG/220px-Get%C3%BAlio_Vargas_-_retrato_oficial_de_1930.JPG
