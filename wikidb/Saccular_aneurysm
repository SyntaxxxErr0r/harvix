1.00	Saccular_aneurysm	Intracranial berry aneurysm	An intracranial berry aneurysm, also known as a saccular aneurysm, is a sac-like outpouching in a cerebral blood vessel, which can seem berry-shaped, hence the name. Once a berry aneurysm has formed it is likely to rupture, causing a stroke. Thus they are serious medical emergencies, and should be treated as soon as possible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Wikipedia_intracranial_aneurysms_-_inferior_view_-_heat_map.jpg/230px-Wikipedia_intracranial_aneurysms_-_inferior_view_-_heat_map.jpg
