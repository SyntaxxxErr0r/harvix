102.5	Organic_compound	Organic compound	An organic compound is any member of a large class of gaseous, liquid, or solid chemical compounds whose molecules contain carbon. For historical reasons discussed below, a few types of carbon-containing compounds such as carbides, carbonates, simple oxides of carbon, and cyanides, as well as the allotropes of carbon such as diamond and graphite, are considered inorganic. The distinction between "organic" and "inorganic" carbon compounds, while "useful in organizing the vast subject of chemistry... is somewhat arbitrary".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Methane-2D-stereo.svg/150px-Methane-2D-stereo.svg.png
