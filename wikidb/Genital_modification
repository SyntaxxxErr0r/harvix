1.00	Genital_modification	Genital modification and mutilation	Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons. Penile subincision, or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of Indigenous Australians. This procedure has taken root in Western body modification culture. Meatotomy is a form that involves splitting of the glans penis alone, while genital bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Fourchette_foto.jpg/220px-Fourchette_foto.jpg
