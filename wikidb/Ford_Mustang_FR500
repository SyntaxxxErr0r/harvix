2.20	Ford_Mustang_FR500	Ford Mustang FR500	The Ford Racing Mustang FR500 is a highly tuned race variant of the Ford Mustang, featuring V8 engine. These are turn key race cars not designed for public road use. Each FR500 model is built with a unique Ford Racing number, and not a DOT VIN. Each is built when ordered through Ford Racing. Each FR500 is built by the same plant, in Flat Rock (Michigan), as the standard Mustang.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Ford_Mustang_FR500GT_Nr22_Oschersleben2008.jpg/250px-Ford_Mustang_FR500GT_Nr22_Oschersleben2008.jpg
