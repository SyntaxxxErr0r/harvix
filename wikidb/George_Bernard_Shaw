220.5	George_Bernard_Shaw	George Bernard Shaw	George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 â€“ 2 November 1950) was an Irish playwright and a co-founder of the London School of Economics. Although his first profitable writing was music and literary criticism, in which capacity he wrote many highly articulate pieces of journalism, his main talent was for drama, and he wrote more than 60 plays. Nearly all his writings address prevailing social problems, but have a vein of comedy which makes their stark themes more palatable. Shaw examined education, marriage, religion, government, health care, and class privilege.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/George_bernard_shaw.jpg/220px-George_bernard_shaw.jpg
