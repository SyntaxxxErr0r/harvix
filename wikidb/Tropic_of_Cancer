62.6	Tropic_of_Cancer	Tropic of Cancer	The Tropic of Cancer, also referred to as the Northern tropic, is the circle of latitude on the Earth that marks the most northerly position at which the Sun may appear directly overhead at its zenith. This event occurs once per year, at the time of the June solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/World_map_with_tropic_of_cancer.svg/350px-World_map_with_tropic_of_cancer.svg.png
