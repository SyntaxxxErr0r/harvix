51.4	Sibling	Sibling	Siblings are people who share at least one parent. A male sibling is called a brother; and a female sibling is called a sister. In most societies throughout the world, siblings usually grow up together and spend a good deal of their childhood socializing with one another. This genetic and physical closeness may be marked by the development of strong emotional bonds such as love, hostility or thoughtfulness. The emotional bond between siblings is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as parental treatment, birth order, personality, and personal experiences outside the family.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Little_Julia_tending_the_baby_at_home.jpg/220px-Little_Julia_tending_the_baby_at_home.jpg
