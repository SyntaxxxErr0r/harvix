8.00	Naive_art	Na誰ve art	Na誰ve art is a classification of art that is often characterized by a childlike simplicity in its subject matter and technique. While many na誰ve artists appear, from their works, to have little or no formal art training, this is often not true. The words "na誰ve" and "primitive" are regarded as pejoratives and are, therefore, avoided by many.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Rousseau_theRepastOfTheLion.jpg/250px-Rousseau_theRepastOfTheLion.jpg
