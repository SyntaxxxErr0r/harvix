99.2	E85	E85	E85 is an abbreviation for an ethanol fuel blend of up to 85% denatured ethanol fuel and gasoline or other hydrocarbon by volume. E85 is commonly used by flex-fuel vehicles in the United States and Europe. In the United States, government promotion of ethanol in general and E85 in particular has encouraged a growing infrastructure for retail sale of E85, especially in corn growing states in the Midwest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/E85_fuel.svg/220px-E85_fuel.svg.png
