After being picked by many to win the AL Central Division and the World Series, the Tigers started the season a disappointing 0-7, being swept by the Kansas City Royals and Chicago White Sox. Their first victory of the season came against the Boston Red Sox. Not until the Tigers' 80th game did the team reach a .500 record.
