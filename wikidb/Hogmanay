67.5	Hogmanay	Hogmanay	Hogmanay is the Scots word for the last day of the year and is synonymous with the celebration of the New Year (Gregorian calendar) in the Scottish manner. It is, however, normally only the start of a celebration which lasts through the night until the morning of New Year's Day (1 January) or, in some cases, 2 January which is a Scottish Bank Holiday.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/EdinburghNYE.jpg/220px-EdinburghNYE.jpg
