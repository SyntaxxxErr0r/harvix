2.20	Chisholm_Spring,_Oklahoma	Chisholm Spring, Oklahoma	Chisholm Spring was a small trading post in Oklahoma Territory, two miles east of present-day Asher, Oklahoma. The post was established by frontier cattleman Jesse Chisholm (for whom the famous Chisholm Trail was named ) in 1847. The settlement attracted many plains Indians, but efforts to create a town were aborted when Chisholm moved to Kansas in 1862..	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Jessechisholm.jpg
