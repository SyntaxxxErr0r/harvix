97.9	MEMS	Microelectromechanical systems	Electron beam lithography (often abbreviated as e-beam lithography) is the practice of scanning a beam of electrons in a patterned fashion across a surface covered with a film (called the resist), ("exposing" the resist) and of selectively removing either exposed or non-exposed regions of the resist ("developing"). The purpose, as with photolithography, is to create very small structures in the resist that can subsequently be transferred to the substrate material, often by etching. It was developed for manufacturing integrated circuits, and is also used for creating nanotechnology architectures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a7/Labonachip20017-300.jpg/220px-Labonachip20017-300.jpg
