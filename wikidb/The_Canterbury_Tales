71.6	The_Canterbury_Tales	The Canterbury Tales	The Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories written in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer at the end of the 14th century. The tales (mostly written in verse although some are in prose) are told as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from Southwark to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the Tabard Inn at Southwark on their return.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Canterbury_Tales.png
