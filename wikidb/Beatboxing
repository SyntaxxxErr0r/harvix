92.5	Beatboxing	Beatboxing	Beatboxing is a form of vocal percussion primarily involving the art of producing drum beats, rhythm, and musical sounds using one's mouth, lips, tongue, and voice. It may also involve singing, vocal imitation of turntablism, and the simulation of horns, strings, and other musical instruments. Beatboxing today is connected with hip-hop culture, being one of "the elements", although it is not limited to hip-hop music. The term "beatboxing" is sometimes used to refer to vocal percussion in general (see vocal percussion for details).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Biz_Markie_at_Amager_Bio_1.jpg/220px-Biz_Markie_at_Amager_Bio_1.jpg
