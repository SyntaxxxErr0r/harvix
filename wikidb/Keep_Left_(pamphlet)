2.00	Keep_Left_(pamphlet)	Keep Left (pamphlet)	Keep Left was a pamphlet published in the United Kingdom in 1947 by the New Statesman, written by Michael Foot, Richard Crossman and Ian Mikardo that advocated a democratic socialist "third force" foreign policy – a socialist Europe acting independently from either the United States or the Soviet Union – against the pro-American foreign policy of Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin. It was a key statement of the Labour left's dissent from the 1945-51 Labour government.
