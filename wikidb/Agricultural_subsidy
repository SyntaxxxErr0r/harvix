53.5	Agricultural_subsidy	Agricultural subsidy	In 2010, the EU spent €57 billion on agricultural development, of which €39 billion was spent on direct subsidies. Agricultural and fisheries subsidies form over 40% of the EU budget. Since 1992 (and especially since 2005), the EU's Common Agricultural Policy has undergone significant change as subsidies have mostly been decoupled from production. The largest subsidy is the Single Farm Payment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/United_States_farm_subsidies_%28source_Congressional_Budget_Office%29.svg/300px-United_States_farm_subsidies_%28source_Congressional_Budget_Office%29.svg.png
