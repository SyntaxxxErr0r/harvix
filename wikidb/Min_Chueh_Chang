4.46	Min_Chueh_Chang	Min Chueh Chang	Dr. Min Chueh Chang (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Zhāng Míngjué, October 10, 1908 – June 5, 1991), often credited as M.C. Chang, was a Chinese American reproductive biologist. His specific area of study was the fertilisation process in mammalian reproduction. Though his career produced findings that are important and valuable to many areas in the field of fertilisation, including his work on in vitro fertilisation which led to the first "test tube baby", he was best known to the world for his contribution to the development of the combined oral contraceptive pill at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/MCChang.gif/200px-MCChang.gif
