1.00	Ultimate_strength	Ultimate tensile strength	Many materials display linear elastic behavior, defined by a linear stress-strain relationship, as shown in the figure up to point 2, in which deformations are completely recoverable upon removal of the load; that is, a specimen loaded elastically in tension will elongate, but will return to its original shape and size when unloaded. Beyond this linear region, for ductile materials, such as steel, deformations are plastic. A plastically deformed specimen will not return to its original size and shape when unloaded. Note that there will be elastic recovery of a portion of the deformation. For many applications, plastic deformation is unacceptable, and is used as the design limitation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Stress_v_strain_Aluminum_2.png/220px-Stress_v_strain_Aluminum_2.png
