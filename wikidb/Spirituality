Spirituality is often experienced as a source of inspiration or orientation in life. It can encompass belief in immaterial realities or experiences of the immanent or transcendent nature of the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/52706main_hstorion_lg.jpg/220px-52706main_hstorion_lg.jpg
