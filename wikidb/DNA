456.8	DNA	DNA	Deoxyribonucleic acid is a nucleic acid containing the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms (with the exception of RNA viruses). The DNA segments carrying this genetic information are called genes. Likewise, other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information. Along with RNA and proteins, DNA is one of the three major macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/DNA_Structure%2BKey%2BLabelled.pn_NoBB.png/340px-DNA_Structure%2BKey%2BLabelled.pn_NoBB.png
