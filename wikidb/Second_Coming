55.1	Second_Coming	Second Coming	In Christianity the second coming of Christ, the second advent, sometimes called the parousia, is the anticipated return of Jesus Christ from Heaven, where he sits at the right hand of God, to earth. This belief is based on prophecies found in the canonical gospels and in most Christian and Islamic eschatologies. Christians generally believe the anticipated event is predicted in biblical messianic prophecies. Views about the nature of Jesus' Second Coming vary among Christian denominations and sometimes among individual Christians within these denominations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Second_Coming_of_Christ_window.jpg/200px-Second_Coming_of_Christ_window.jpg
