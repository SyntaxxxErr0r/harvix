2.00	Tax_honesty	Tax protester history in the United States	A tax protester, in the United States, is a person who denies that he or she owes a tax based on the belief that the constitution, statutes, or regulations do not empower the government to impose, assess or collect the tax. The tax protester may have no dispute with how the government spends its revenue. This differentiates a tax protester from a tax resister, who seeks to avoid paying a tax because the tax is being used for purposes with which the resister takes issue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/No_IRS.svg/100px-No_IRS.svg.png
