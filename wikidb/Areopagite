4.10	Areopagite	Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite	Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, also known as Pseudo-Denys, was a Christian theologian and philosopher of the late 5th to early 6th century, the author of the Corpus Areopagiticum (before 532). The author is identified as "Dionysos" in the corpus, which later incorrectly came to be attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite, the Athenian convert of St. Paul mentioned in Acts 17:34. His surviving works include Divine Names, Mystical Theology, Celestial Hierarchy, Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, and various epistles. Some other works, such as Theological Outlines, are presumed to be lost.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/00058_christ_pantocrator_mosaic_hagia_sophia_656x800.jpg/120px-00058_christ_pantocrator_mosaic_hagia_sophia_656x800.jpg
