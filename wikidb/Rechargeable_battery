65.9	Rechargeable_battery	Rechargeable battery	A rechargeable battery, storage battery or accumulator is a group of one or more electrochemical cells. They are known as secondary cells because their electrochemical reactions are electrically reversible. Rechargeable batteries come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging anything from a button cell to megawatt systems connected to stabilize an electrical distribution network. Several different combinations of chemicals are commonly used, including: leadâ€“acid, nickel cadmium (NiCd), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), lithium ion (Li-ion), and lithium ion polymer (Li-ion polymer).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Nokia_Battery_Hologram.jpg/200px-Nokia_Battery_Hologram.jpg
