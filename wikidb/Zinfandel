57.7	Zinfandel	Zinfandel	Zinfandel is a variety of red grape planted in over 10 percent of California vineyards. DNA fingerprinting revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grape Crljenak Ka≈°telanski, and also the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Puglia (the "heel" of Italy), where it was introduced in the 18th century. The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th century, and became known by variations of the name "Zinfandel", a name of uncertain origin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Zinfandel_grapes.jpg/215px-Zinfandel_grapes.jpg
