1.20	S%C3%BCkhbaatar's_Mausoleum	S端khbaatar's Mausoleum	S端khbaatar's Mausoleum was a mausoleum for Damdin S端khbaatar, leader of Mongolia's 1921 revolution, and Khorloogiin Choibalsan, head of Mongolia's government from the late 1930s to his death in 1952, in Mongolia's capital Ulaanbaatar, on the northern side of S端khbaatar Square in front of the Saaral Ordon. The building was erected after Choibalsans death, and removed in 2005 to make place for a hall dedicated to Genghis Khan. The mausoleum resembled the shape of Lenin's Mausoleum but differed in color.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Suhbataar_square_n_mausoleum_b.jpg/220px-Suhbataar_square_n_mausoleum_b.jpg
