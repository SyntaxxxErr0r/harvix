6.42	Emerging_Technology_Conference	Emerging Technology Conference	The O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference (not to be confused with the MIT Emtech conference) is O'Reilly Media's premier conference about the new technologies that are on the O'Reilly Radar. O'Reilly defines its core business not as books, conferences, or online publishing, though it does all three, but as "changing the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators". While other O'Reilly conferences, such as the Open Source Convention, the MySQL Conference, or the Web 2.0 Summit and Expos, focus on specific technologies, ETech, as the Emerging Technology Conference is commonly called, highlights different issues and emerging trends each year, with a focus on innovations by non-commercial developers and enthusiasts.
