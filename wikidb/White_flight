89.0	White_flight	White flight	White flight is a term that originated in the United States, starting in the mid-20th century, and applied to the large-scale migration of whites of various European ancestries from racially mixed urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions. It was first seen as originating from fear and anxiety about increasing minority populations . The term has more recently been applied to other migrations by whites, from older, inner suburbs to rural areas, as well as from the US Northeast and Midwest to the milder climate in Southeast and Southwest, but this is a change from its original cause and meaning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/1943_Colored_Waiting_Room_Sign.jpg/100px-1943_Colored_Waiting_Room_Sign.jpg
