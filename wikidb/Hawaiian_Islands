56.6	Hawaiian_Islands	Hawaiian Islands	The Hawaiian Islands (Hawaiian: ) are an archipelago of eight major islands, several atolls, numerous smaller islets, and undersea seamounts in the North Pacific Ocean, extending some 1,500 miles (2,400 km) from the island of Hawaii in the south to northernmost Kure Atoll (the northwesternmost island in Hawaii is Green Island, which is joined to the Kure Atoll). Excluding Midway, which is an unincorporated territory within the United States Minor Outlying Islands, the Hawaiian Islands form the U.S. state of Hawaii. Once known as the "Sandwich Islands", the archipelago now takes its name from the largest island in the cluster.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Hawaje-NoRedLine.jpg/250px-Hawaje-NoRedLine.jpg
