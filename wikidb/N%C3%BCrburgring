113.5	N%C3%BCrburgring	N端rburgring	The N端rburgring is a motorsports complex around the village of N端rburg, Germany. It features a Grand Prix race track built in 1984, and a much longer old North loop track which was built in the 1920s around the village and medieval castle of N端rburg in the Eifel mountains. It is located about 70 km (43 mi) south of Cologne, and 120 km (75 mi) northwest of Frankfurt. The old track was nicknamed "The Green Hell" by Jackie Stewart and is widely considered one of the most demanding purpose-built racing circuits in the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Nurburgring.svg/230px-Nurburgring.svg.png
