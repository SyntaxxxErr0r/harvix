1.00	Echunga%2C_South_Australia	Echunga, South Australia	Echunga is a small town in the Adelaide Hills located 34 km south-east of Adelaide in South Australia. The area was initially settled in 1839, with the town laid out in 1849. Gold was discovered in 1852 and Echunga became the first proclaimed goldfield in South Australia. This led to a gold rush, however it did not last long with the diggings exhausted and all but abandoned within a year. Subsequent discoveries in 1853 and 1854 led to smaller and equally short-lived rushes. In 1868 more gold was discovered at nearby Jupiter Creek, which proved to be a much larger and long-lived field.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Australia_South_Australia_location_map_blank.svg/270px-Australia_South_Australia_location_map_blank.svg.png
