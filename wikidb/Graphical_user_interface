228.0	Graphical_user_interface	Graphical user interface	In computing, a graphical user interface is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices with images rather than text commands. GUIs can be used in computers, hand-held devices such as MP3 players, portable media players or gaming devices, household appliances and office equipment. A GUI represents the information and actions available to a user through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. The actions are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/KDE_4.png/300px-KDE_4.png
