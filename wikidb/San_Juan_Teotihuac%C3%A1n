2.00	San_Juan_Teotihuac%C3%A1n	San Juan Teotihuacán	San Juan Teotihuacán is a town and municipality located in the State of Mexico. It is in the northeast of the Valley of Mexico, 45 km northeast of Mexico City and 119 km from the state capital of Toluca. Teotihuacan takes its name from the ancient city and World Heritage site that is located next to the municipal seat. “Teotihuacan” is from Nahuatl and means “place of the gods.” In Nahua mythology the sun and the moon were created here. The seal of the municipality features the Pyramid of the Sun from the archeological site, which represents the four cardinal directions. The building is tied to a character that represents water which is linked to an arm that is joined to the head of an indigenous person who is seated and speaking. This person represents a god. Much of the history of the area has been tied to the ancient city, most recently involves controversy connected with commerce and development around the site.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/PlazaTeotiEdomex.JPG/250px-PlazaTeotiEdomex.JPG
