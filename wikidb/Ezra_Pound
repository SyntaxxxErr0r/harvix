138.9	Ezra_Pound	Ezra Pound	Ezra Weston Loomis Pound (30 October 1885 â€“ 1 November 1972) was an American expatriate poet and critic and a major figure in the early modernist movement in poetry. He became known for his role in developing Imagism, which, in reaction to the Victorian and Georgian poets, favored tight language, unadorned imagery, and a strong correspondence between the verbal and musical qualities of the verse and the mood it expressed. His best-known works include Ripostes (1912), Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920), and his unfinished 120-section epic, The Cantos, which consumed his middle and late career, and was published between 1917 and 1969.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Ezra_Pound_2.jpg/248px-Ezra_Pound_2.jpg
