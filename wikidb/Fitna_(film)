66.1	Fitna_(film)	Fitna (film)	Fitna (Arabic: â€Ž) is a 2008 cinematic commentary by Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders about Islam. Approximately 17 minutes in length, the movie shows selected excerpts from Suras of the Qur'an, interspersed with media clips and newspaper cuttings showing or describing acts of violence and/or hatred by Muslims. The film attempts to demonstrate that the Qur'an motivates its followers to hate all who violate Islamic teachings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Fitnathemovie.jpg/220px-Fitnathemovie.jpg
