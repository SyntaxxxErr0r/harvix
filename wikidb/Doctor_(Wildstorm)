6.30	Doctor_(Wildstorm)	Doctor (Wildstorm)	The Doctor is a name of several fictional characters in the Wildstorm universe. There is always only one Doctor at any given time, who is the latest in a long line of shamans protecting the entire planet. Each Doctor is as powerful as the sum of all preceding Doctors, each of whom was also as wise and powerful as the sum of all preceding Doctors, hence, each new Doctor is more powerful than his immediate predecessor. The Doctor's vast magical abilities can do almost anything, as long as he can conceive and believe in his abilities in poetic terms, although more powerful feats can take their toll both on the Doctor and the planet's ecosystem.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Comic_image_missing.svg/125px-Comic_image_missing.svg.png
