51.3	Aquarius_(astrology)	Aquarius (astrology)	Aquarius (Greek: Ύδροχόος, "Hudrokhoös", Latin: "Aquārius", Chinese: "宝瓶座") is the eleventh astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the constellation Aquarius. It spans the Zodiac between the 300th and 329th degree of celestial longitude. In astrology, Aquarius is considered a "masculine", positive (extrovert) sign. It is also considered an air sign and is one of four fixed signs. Aquarius has been traditionally ruled by the planet Saturn, and, since its discovery, Uranus has been considered a modern co-ruler of this sign. "Exalting" planets are either Mars and/or Neptune, while the "fall" planets are Mercury and/or Venus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Aquarius2.jpg/240px-Aquarius2.jpg
