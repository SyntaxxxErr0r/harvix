10.41	Second_Council_of_Ephesus	Second Council of Ephesus	The Second Council of Ephesus (commonly known as the Robber Council of Ephesus) was a Christological church synod in 449 AD, convoked by Emperor Theodosius II under the presidency of the monophysite Dioscorus. It was intended to be an ecumenical council, but because of the scandalous nature of the proceedings, canon legalities, and the unorthodox nature of the canons and decrees as viewed by the orthodox bishops of East and West (and the later ecumenical councils), it was never accepted as ecumenical, and was explicitly repudiated by the fourth and next ecumenical council, the Council of Chalcedon of 451, and named Latrocinium, or "Robber Council".
