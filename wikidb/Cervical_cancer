61.6	Cervical_cancer	Cervical cancer	Cervical cancer is the term for a malignant neoplasm arising from cells originating in the cervix uteri. One of the most common symptoms of cervical cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding, but in some cases there may be no obvious symptoms until the cancer has progressed to an advanced stage. Treatment usually consists of surgery (including local excision) in early stages, and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in more advanced stages of the disease.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Ca_in_situ%2C_cervix_2.jpg/230px-Ca_in_situ%2C_cervix_2.jpg
