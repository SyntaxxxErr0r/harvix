77.4	Michael_Scott_(The_Office)	Michael Scott (The Office)	Michael Gary Scott (born March 15, 1964) is a fictional character on NBC's The Office, portrayed by Steve Carell, and based on David Brent from the original British version. Michael, the central character of the series, was the manager (formerly co-manager) of the Scranton branch of paper and printer distribution company Dunder Mifflin Inc. Prior to being co-manager, he was the regional manager of the branch, but in the season 6 episode "The Meeting", he was made co-manager with Jim Halpert; however, they returned to their original roles in "The Manager and the Salesman". In the fifth season, Michael Scott briefly left his position to start his own company, The Michael Scott Paper Company. Dunder Mifflin purchased the Michael Scott Paper Company and as part of the agreement rehired Scott as the regional manager. In the seventh season, Michael decided to move with his fianc√©e Holly Flax to Colorado to help her take care of her aging parents, thus preparing to begin a new chapter of his life and end his ties with Dunder Mifflin. He officially left Scranton in "Goodbye, Michael".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/MichaelScott.png
