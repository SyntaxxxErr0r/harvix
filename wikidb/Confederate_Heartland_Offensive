From June to October, Confederate forces under the commands of Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith launched a series of movements to outflank the Union Army of the Ohio and draw the border state of Kentucky into the Confederate States of America. Though the Confederates gained some early successes, their progress was stopped decisively at the Battle of Perryville, leaving Kentucky in Union hands for the rest of the war.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Buellandbragg.JPG/310px-Buellandbragg.JPG
