56.5	Supervolcano	Supervolcano	Large igneous provinces (LIP) such as Iceland, the Siberian Traps, Deccan Traps, and the Ontong Java Plateau are extensive regions of basalts on a continental scale resulting from flood basalt eruptions. When created, these regions often occupy several thousand square kilometres and have volumes on the order of millions of cubic kilometers. In most cases, the lavas are normally laid down over several million years. They do release massive amounts of gases. The Réunion hotspot produced the Deccan Traps about 65 million years ago, coincident with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The scientific consensus is that an astrobleme impact was the cause of the extinction event, but the volcanic activity may have caused environmental stresses on extant species up to the K–T boundary. Additionally, the largest flood basalt event (the Siberian Traps) occurred around 250 Ma and was coincident with the largest mass extinction in history, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, although it is also unknown whether it was completely responsible for the extinction event..	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/HotspotsSRP.jpg/300px-HotspotsSRP.jpg
