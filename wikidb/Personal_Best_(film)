Despite their commitment to their training regimen, their dreams are thwarted when the United States announces its boycott of the Games for political reasons, leaving them with only the informal "personal best" marks they achieved during training to connote their achievements.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/40/PersonalBest1982.jpg/220px-PersonalBest1982.jpg
