6.00	We_Cry	We Cry	"We Cry" is the debut single by Irish band The Script. The single was released on 25 April 2008 and is said to be about people Danny knew in Dublin while he grew up. The song has received a large amount of publicity, airplay and interest with BBC Radio 1 heavily backing the band. It is one of the few Script songs to bear a Parental Advisory label for one use of the word "fuck".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/WeCry.png/220px-WeCry.png
