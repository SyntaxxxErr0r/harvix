12.42	Wandervogel	Wandervogel	Wandervogel is the name adopted by a popular movement of German youth groups from 1896 onward. The name can be translated as rambling, hiking or wandering bird (differing in meaning from "Zugvogel" or migratory bird) and the ethos is to shake off the restrictions of society and get back to nature and freedom. Soon the groups split and there originated ever more organisations, which still all called themselves Wandervogel, but were organisationally independent. Nonetheless the feeling was still of being a common movement, but split into several branches.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Wandervogel_greif.svg/235px-Wandervogel_greif.svg.png
