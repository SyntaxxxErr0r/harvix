73.7	Peeps	Peeps	Peeps are marshmallow candies, sold in the United States and Canada, that are shaped into chicks, bunnies, and other animals. There are also different shapes used for various holidays. Peeps are used primarily to fill Easter baskets, though recent advertising campaigns market the candy as "Peeps - Always in Season", as Peeps has since expanded to include Halloween, Christmas and Valentine's Day. They are made from marshmallow, corn syrup, gelatin, and carnauba wax.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Peeps-Yellow-Pink.jpg/250px-Peeps-Yellow-Pink.jpg
