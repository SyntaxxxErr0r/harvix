51.4	Meteoroid	Meteoroid	A meteoroid is a sand- to boulder-sized particle of debris in the Solar System. The visible path of a meteoroid that enters Earth's (or another body's) atmosphere is called a meteor, or colloquially a shooting star or falling star. If a meteoroid reaches the ground and survives impact, then it is called a meteorite. Many meteors appearing seconds or minutes apart are called a meteor shower. The root word meteor comes from the Greek meteoÂ¯ros, meaning "high in the air".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/IMG_8505n3.JPG/220px-IMG_8505n3.JPG
