173.6	Speed_of_light	Speed of light	The speed of light in vacuum, usually denoted by c, is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics. Its value is 299,792,458 metres per second, a figure that is exact since the length of the metre is defined from this constant and the international standard for time. In imperial units this speed is approximately 186,282 miles per second.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Sun_to_Earth.JPG/300px-Sun_to_Earth.JPG
