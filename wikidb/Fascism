182.1	Fascism	Fascism	Fascism ( ) is a radical authoritarian nationalist political ideology. Fascists seek rejuvenation of their nation based on commitment to an organic national community where its individuals are united together as one people in national identity by suprapersonal connections of ancestry, culture, and blood through a totalitarian single-party state that seeks the mass mobilization of a nation through discipline, indoctrination, physical education, and eugenics. Fascism seeks to purify the nation of foreign influences that are deemed to be causing degeneration of the nation or of not fitting into the national culture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Italian_Fascist_flag_1930s-1940s.svg/150px-Italian_Fascist_flag_1930s-1940s.svg.png
