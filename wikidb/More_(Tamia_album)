1.00	More_(Tamia_album)	More (Tamia album)	More is the third album by Canadian R&amp;B singer-songwriter Tamia, released on April 6, 2004 in North America by Elektra Records. The album debuted number 17 on the US Billboard 200, selling 58,000 copies in its first week sales, and debuting at number two on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart. The album has received generally positive reviews from most music critics, who praised Tamia's vocals, songwriting and the album's production. It was originally scheduled (and titled Still) for a 2003 release but was later delayed due to Tamia's multiple sclerosis diagnosis. A couple of songs ("It's a Party" "No Way" "Hold Up" "Don't Think" "Officially Missing You (MIDI Mafia Remix)") from the Still edition of the album that didn't make the physical release were included as bonus/soundtrack tracks or leaked later.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/Tamia-MoreAlbum.jpg/220px-Tamia-MoreAlbum.jpg
