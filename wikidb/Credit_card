It allows its holder to buy goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay for these goods and services. The issuer of the card creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the consumer (or the user) from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Smartcard2.png/140px-Smartcard2.png
