51.9	Platform_virtualization	Hardware virtualization	Computer hardware virtualization (or hardware virtualisation) is the virtualization of computers or operating systems. It hides the physical characteristics of a computing platform from users, instead showing another abstract computing platform. At its origins, the software that controlled virtualization was called a "control program", but nowadays the terms "hypervisor" or "virtual machine monitor" are preferred.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Hardware_Virtualization_%28copy%29.svg/220px-Hardware_Virtualization_%28copy%29.svg.png
