66.1	Smoke_detector	Smoke detector	An optical detector is a light sensor. When used as a smoke detector, it includes a light source (incandescent bulb or infrared LED), a lens to collimate the light into a beam, and a photodiode or other photoelectric sensor at an angle to the beam as a light detector. In the absence of smoke, the light passes in front of the detector in a straight line. When smoke enters the optical chamber across the path of the light beam, some light is scattered by the smoke particles, directing it at the sensor and thus triggering the alarm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/OpticalSD.jpg/250px-OpticalSD.jpg
