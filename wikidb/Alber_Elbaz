59.0	Alber_Elbaz	Alber Elbaz	In 1985, Elbaz moved to New York City and spent two years working for a manufacturer of mother-of-the-bride clothing. He then worked for Geoffrey Beene for seven years. He says he was influenced by Beene's rejection of trends and masterful drape and fit. "It was a very beautiful relationship.... Our best dialogue was not in words," Elbaz has reminisced.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Lanvin_Monte_Carlo_2004.jpg/220px-Lanvin_Monte_Carlo_2004.jpg
