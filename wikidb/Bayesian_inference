106.3	Bayesian_inference	Bayesian inference	In statistics, Bayesian inference is a method of inference in which Bayes' rule is used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is learned. Bayesian updating is an important technique throughout statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics: Exhibiting a Bayesian derivation for a statistical method automatically ensures that the method works as well as any competing method, for some cases. Bayesian updating is especially important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data. Bayesian inference has found application in a range of fields including science, engineering, medicine, and law.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Bayesian_inference_event_space.svg/220px-Bayesian_inference_event_space.svg.png
