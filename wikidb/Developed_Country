3.00	Developed_Country	Developed country	A developed country can be defined through economic growth and security. Most commonly the criteria for evaluating the degree of development is to look at gross domestic product (GDP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living. Which criteria, and which countries are classified as being developed, is a contentious issue. According to the International Monetary Fund, advanced economies comprise 65.8% of global nominal GDP and 52.1% of global GDP (PPP) in 2010.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/2011_UN_Human_Development_Report_Quartiles.svg/400px-2011_UN_Human_Development_Report_Quartiles.svg.png
