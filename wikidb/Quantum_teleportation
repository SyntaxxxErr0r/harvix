55.7	Quantum_teleportation	Quantum teleportation	The prerequisites for quantum teleportation are a qubit that is to be teleported, a conventional communication channel capable of transmitting two classical bits (i.e., one of four states), and means of generating an entangled EPR pair of qubits, performing a Bell measurement on the EPR pair, and manipulating the quantum state of one of the pair. The protocol is then as follows:	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Quantum_teleportation_diagram.PNG/300px-Quantum_teleportation_diagram.PNG
