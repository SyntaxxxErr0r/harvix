2.20	Great_Dyke	Great Dyke	The Great Dyke is a linear geological feature that trends nearly north-south through the centre of Zimbabwe passing just to the west of the capital, Harare. It consists of a band of short, narrow ridges and hills spanning for approximately 550 kilometres (340 mi). The hills become taller as the range goes north, and reach up to 460 metres (1,510 ft) above the Mvurwi Range. The range is host to vast ore deposits, including gold, silver, chromium, platinum, nickel and asbestos.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Satellite_image_of_Zimbabwe_in_December_2002.jpg/220px-Satellite_image_of_Zimbabwe_in_December_2002.jpg
