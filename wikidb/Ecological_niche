55.9	Ecological_niche	Ecological niche	In ecology, a niche ( or ) is a term describing the relational position of a species or population in its ecosystem to each other; e.g. a dolphin could potentially be in another ecological niche from one that travels in a different pod if the members of these pods utilize significantly different food resources and foraging methods. A shorthand definition of niche is how an organism makes a living. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (e.g., by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (e.g., limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Blacksmoker_in_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg/220px-Blacksmoker_in_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg
