13.20	Bushisms	Bushism	Bushisms are unconventional words, phrases, pronunciations, malapropisms, and semantic or linguistic errors that have occurred in the public speaking of former President of the United States George W. Bush and, much less notably, of his father, George H. W. Bush. The term has become part of popular folklore and is the basis of a number of websites and published books. It is often used to caricature the two presidents. Common characteristics include malapropisms, the creation of neologisms, spoonerisms, stunt words and grammatically incorrect subject-verb agreement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Bush_at_podium_20050428.jpg/220px-Bush_at_podium_20050428.jpg
