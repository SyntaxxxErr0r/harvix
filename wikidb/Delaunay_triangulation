74.5	Delaunay_triangulation	Delaunay triangulation	In mathematics and computational geometry, a Delaunay triangulation for a set P of points in a plane is a triangulation DT such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P). Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation; they tend to avoid skinny triangles. The triangulation is named after Boris Delaunay for his work on this topic from 1934.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Delaunay_circumcircles.png/280px-Delaunay_circumcircles.png
