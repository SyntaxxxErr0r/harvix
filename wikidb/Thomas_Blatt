8.13	Thomas_Blatt	Thomas Blatt	Thomas "Toivi" Blatt (born April 15, 1927) was one of the few survivors who successfully escaped Sobibor extermination camp. While fleeing the SS he was betrayed by a farmer who was hiding him, resulting in a gunshot injury to the jaw. The bullet remains there to this day. Toivi went on to write the book From The Ashes of Sobibor about his experience in Sobibor, including his part in the plot that led the 600-prisoner revolt on October 14, 1943, as well as his life before the war leading up to the German occupation of his village, Izbica.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Thomas_blatt.gif/150px-Thomas_blatt.gif
