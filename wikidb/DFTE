1.00	DFTE	Delaunay tessellation field estimator	The Delaunay tessellation field estimator (DTFE) is a mathematical tool for reconstructing a volume-covering and continuous density or intensity field from a discrete point set. The DTFE has various astrophysical applications, such as the analysis of numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation, the mapping of the large scale structure in the universe and improving computer simulation programs of cosmic structure formation. It has been developed by Willem Schaap and Rien van de Weijgaert. The main advantage of the DTFE is that it automatically adapts to (strong) variations in density and geometry. It is therefore very well suited for studies of the large scale galaxy distribution.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/Dtfeproblem.jpg/220px-Dtfeproblem.jpg
