52.7	Youth_International_Party	Youth International Party	The Youth International Party, whose members were commonly called Yippies, was a radically youth-oriented and countercultural revolutionary offshoot of the free speech and anti-war movements of the 1960s. It was founded on Dec. 31, 1967. They employed theatrical gestures, such as advancing a pig ("Pigasus the Immortal") as a candidate for President in 1968, to mock the social status quo. They have been described as a highly theatrical, anti-authoritarian and anarchist youth movement of "symbolic politics".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Yippieflag.gif/200px-Yippieflag.gif
