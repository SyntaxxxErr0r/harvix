As a young man, he engaged in a remarkable journey, which began as an ascetic monk's pilgrimage from China to Jerusalem, led him to the Patriarch position in Baghdad, and brought him to recommend his former teacher and traveling companion, the monk Rabban Bar Sauma, to become the first Asian ambassador to Europe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Ricoldo_de_Montecroce_et_les_Nestoriens.jpeg/250px-Ricoldo_de_Montecroce_et_les_Nestoriens.jpeg
