80.8	Grunge	Grunge	Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged as a fusion of punk, alternative, and heavy metal during the mid-1980s in the American state of Washington, particularly in the Seattle area. Inspired by hardcore punk, metal, and indie rock, grunge is generally characterized by heavily distorted electric guitars, contrasting song dynamics, and apathetic or angst-filled lyrics. The grunge aesthetic is stripped-down compared to other forms of rock music, and many grunge musicians were noted for their unkempt appearances and rejection of theatrics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/U-Men_at_the_Bat_Cave_Seattle.jpg/260px-U-Men_at_the_Bat_Cave_Seattle.jpg
