55.2	Colostrum	Colostrum	Colostrum (also known colloquially as beestings, bisnings or first milk) is a form of milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals in late pregnancy. Most species will generate colostrum just prior to giving birth. Colostrum contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease, as well as being lower in fat and higher in protein than ordinary milk.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Colostrum_vs_breastmilk.jpg/220px-Colostrum_vs_breastmilk.jpg
