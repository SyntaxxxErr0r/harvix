162.7	John_Wesley	John Wesley	John Wesley (28 June 1703 â€“ 2 March 1791) was a Church of England cleric and Christian theologian. Wesley is largely credited, along with his brother Charles Wesley, as founding the Methodist movement which began when he took to open-air preaching in a similar manner to George Whitefield. In contrast to George Whitefield's Calvinism, Wesley embraced the Arminian doctrines that were dominant in the 18th-century Church of England. Methodism in both forms was a highly successful evangelical movement in the United Kingdom, which encouraged people to experience Jesus Christ personally.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/John_Wesley_by_George_Romney_1789.jpg/250px-John_Wesley_by_George_Romney_1789.jpg
