1.10	Heterodyne_receiver	Superheterodyne receiver	In electronics, a superheterodyne receiver (sometimes shortened to superhet) uses frequency mixing or heterodyning to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency, which can be more conveniently processed than the original radio carrier frequency. Virtually all modern radio and television receivers use the superheterodyne principle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/5tubes-radio.jpg/220px-5tubes-radio.jpg
