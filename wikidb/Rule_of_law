116.2	Rule_of_law	Rule of law	The rule of law is a legal maxim that suggests that governmental decisions be made by applying known legal principles. The phrase can be traced back to 17th century and was popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. The concept was familiar to ancient philosophers such as Aristotle, who wrote "Law should govern". Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for example by divine right.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/A_mosaic_LAW_by_Frederick_Dielman%2C_1847-1935.JPG/220px-A_mosaic_LAW_by_Frederick_Dielman%2C_1847-1935.JPG
