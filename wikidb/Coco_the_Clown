7.30	Coco_the_Clown	Nicolai Poliakoff	Nicolai Poliakoff OBE (1900 â€“ 25 September 1974) (Latvian: ) was the creator of Coco the Clown, arguably the most famous clown in the UK during the middle decades of the 20th century. Technically, Coco is not a clown but an auguste, the foolish character who is always on the receiving end of buckets of water and custard pies. The auguste often works with the cleverer white-faced clown, who always gets the better of him.
