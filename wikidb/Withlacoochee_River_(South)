It flows west, then north, and then turns northwest and finally west again before it empties into the Gulf of Mexico near Yankeetown. The river is 141 miles (227 km) long and has a drainage basin of 1,170 square miles (3,000 km2). It is believed to have been named after the Withlacoochee River to the north.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Withlacoocheesouthrivermap.png/200px-Withlacoocheesouthrivermap.png
