LOOP provides tanker offloading and temporary storage services for crude oil transported on some of the largest tankers in the world. Most tankers offloading at LOOP are too large for U.S. inland ports. LOOP handles 13 percent of the nation's foreign oil, about 1.2 million barrels (190,000 m3) a day, and connects by pipeline to 50 percent of the U.S. refining capability.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Oliva_at_LOOP.JPG/300px-Oliva_at_LOOP.JPG
