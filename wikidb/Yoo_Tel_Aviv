4.10	Yoo_Tel_Aviv	Park Tzameret	Park Tzameret is a newly built neighborhood of Tel Aviv, Israel, currently under construction in the east-central side of the city. Set to contain twelve luxurious tall apartment buildings, surrounded by green space, the 133 dunam area has been modelled upon similar projects in London and Paris. Only 18% of the area will contain buildings. Two squares will be built at the southern and northern sides of the neighborhood with a 60 meter wide avenue linking them. Mature trees and vegetation will be planted along the avenue. In total, 1,747 apartments will be built in the neighborhood with 6,000 sqm of commercial and public buildings. The east and west boundaries of the area will be delineated by 4.5 meter high acoustic barriers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Tsammeret011.jpg/220px-Tsammeret011.jpg
