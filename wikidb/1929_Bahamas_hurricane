3.00	1929_Bahamas_hurricane	1929 Bahamas hurricane	The 1929 Bahamas Hurricane (also known as the Great Andros Island Hurricane) was the second hurricane and the only major hurricane during the very inactive 1929 Atlantic hurricane season. The hurricane was the only hurricane to cause any significant damage, resulting in $676,000 (1929 USD, $7.3 million 2005 USD) in damage. Only a year after the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, the hurricane caused only three deaths in southern Florida, a low number due to well-executed warnings. The hurricane was much more severe in the Bahamas, where damage was near extreme due to the hurricane stalling over the area for an extended period of time. There, the hurricane caused 48 deaths.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/1929_Bahamas_hurricane_Andros_Island_map.JPG/220px-1929_Bahamas_hurricane_Andros_Island_map.JPG
