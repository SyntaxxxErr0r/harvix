71.1	Lateralization_of_brain_function	Lateralization of brain function	A longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. The sides resemble each other and each hemisphere's structure is generally mirrored by the other side. Yet despite the strong anatomical similarities, the functions of each cortical hemisphere are managed differently. For example, the lateral sulcus generally is longer in the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Cerebral_lobes.png/220px-Cerebral_lobes.png
