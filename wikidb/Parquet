6.22	Parquet	Parquetry	Parquetry is a geometric mosaic of wood pieces used for decorative effect. The two main uses of parquetry are as veneer patterns on furniture and block patterns for flooring. Parquet patterns are entirely geometrical and angularâ€”squares, triangles, lozenges. The most popular parquet flooring pattern is herringbone. (The use of curved and natural shapes constitutes marquetry rather than parquetry.)	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Parquethall.jpg/220px-Parquethall.jpg
