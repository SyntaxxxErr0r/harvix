4.00	Repressor_lexA	Repressor lexA	Repressor LexA or LexA is a repressor enzyme that represses SOS response genes coding for DNA polymerases required for repairing DNA damage. LexA is intimately linked to RecA in the biochemical cycle of DNA damage and repair. RecA binds to DNA-bound LexA causing LexA to cleave itself in a process called autoproteolysis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/PDB_1jhh_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1jhh_EBI.jpg
