71.0	Mestizo	Mestizo	Mestizo is a term traditionally used in Latin America and Spain for people of mixed heritage or descent. In some countries it has come to mean a mixture of European and Amerindian, while in others, like Venezuela, mestizo still retains the original meaning of being mixed without specifying which admixture. The term was used as a racial category in the Casta system that was in use during the Spanish empire's control of their American colonies; it was used to describe those who had one European-born parent and one who was a member of an indigenous American population, in some countries, while it was used to refer to people of European, African and Indigenous admixture in others like Venezuela. In the Casta system mestizos had fewer rights than European born persons called "Peninsulares", and "Creoles" who were persons born in the New World of two European-born parents, but more rights than "Indios" and Negros.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Cabrera_15_Coyote.jpg/180px-Cabrera_15_Coyote.jpg
