8.20	Critical_regionalism	Critical regionalism	Critical Regionalism is an approach to architecture that strives to counter placelessness and lack of identity in Modern Architecture by using the building's geographical context. The term Critical Regionalism was first used by the architectural theorists Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre and, with a slightly different meaning, by the historian-theorist Kenneth Frampton.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Bagsv2.JPG/150px-Bagsv2.JPG
