8.00	Varanid	Monitor lizard	Monitor lizards are usually large reptiles, although some can be as small as 20 centimetres (7.9 in) in length. They have long necks, powerful tails and claws, and well-developed limbs. Most species are terrestrial, but arboreal and semiaquatic monitors are also known. Almost all monitor lizards are carnivorous, although Varanus bitatawa, Varanus mabitang and Varanus olivaceus are also known to eat fruit. They are oviparous, laying from seven to 37 eggs, which they often cover with soil or protect in a hollow tree stump.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Monitor_lizard_in_Kalahari.JPG/220px-Monitor_lizard_in_Kalahari.JPG
