The immediate cause of the protests was mainly the unannounced decision of the ruling junta, the State Peace and Development Council, to remove fuel subsidies, which caused the price of diesel and petrol to suddenly rise as much as 66%, and the price of compressed natural gas for buses to increase fivefold in less than a week.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/2007_Myanmar_protests_7.jpg/250px-2007_Myanmar_protests_7.jpg
