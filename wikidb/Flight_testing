2.01	Flight_testing	Flight test	Flight testing is a branch of aeronautical engineering that develops and gathers data during flight of an aircraft and then analyzes the data to evaluate the flight characteristics of the aircraft and validate its design, including safety aspects. The flight test phase accomplishes two major tasks: 1) finding and fixing any aircraft design problems and then 2) verifying and documenting the aircraft capabilities for government certification or customer acceptance. The flight test phase can range from the test of a single new system for an existing aircraft to the complete development and certification of a new aircraft. Therefore the duration of a flight test program can vary from a few weeks to many years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Sukhoi_Superjet_100_prototype.jpg/220px-Sukhoi_Superjet_100_prototype.jpg
