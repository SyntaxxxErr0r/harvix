55.0	Binge_drinking	Binge drinking	Binge drinking or heavy episodic drinking is the modern epithet for drinking alcoholic beverages with the primary intention of becoming intoxicated by heavy consumption of alcohol over a short period of time. It is a kind of purposeful drinking style that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups. The degree of intoxication, however, varies between and within various cultures that engage in this practice. A binge on alcohol can occur over hours or last up to several days. Due to the long-term effects of alcohol misuse, binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/PostcardAHappyNewYear1912.jpg/250px-PostcardAHappyNewYear1912.jpg
