58.0	Quantum_chromodynamics	Quantum chromodynamics	In theoretical physics, quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the strong interaction (color force), a fundamental force describing the interactions between quarks and gluons which make up hadrons (such as the proton, neutron or pion). It is the study of the SU(3) Yangâ€“Mills theory of color-charged fermions (the quarks). QCD is a quantum field theory of a special kind called a non-abelian gauge theory, consisting of a 'color field' mediated by a set of exchange particles (the gluons). The theory is an important part of the Standard Model of particle physics. A huge body of experimental evidence for QCD has been gathered over the years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg/220px-Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg.png
