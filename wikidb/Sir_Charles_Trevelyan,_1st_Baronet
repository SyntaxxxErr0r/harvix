13.31	Sir_Charles_Trevelyan,_1st_Baronet	Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet	Sir Charles Edward Trevelyan, 1st Baronet, KCB (2 April 1807 â€“ 19 June 1886) was a British civil servant and colonial administrator. As a young man, he worked with the colonial government in Calcutta, India; in the late 1850s and 1860s he served there in senior-level appointments. As Assistant Secretary to HM Treasury (1840-1859), he administered relief for the Irish famine and directed work of the Central Board for Highland Relief in Scotland, and is believed to have exacerbated the fatalities by his lack of effective action. He is widely credited with reform of the British civil service, to recruit educated people suitable for positions formerly awarded by aristocratic patronage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Charles_Edward_Trevelyan.jpg/200px-Charles_Edward_Trevelyan.jpg
