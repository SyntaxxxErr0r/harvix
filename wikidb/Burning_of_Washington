60.8	Burning_of_Washington	Burning of Washington	The Burning of Washington in 1814 was an armed conflict during the War of 1812 between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States of America. On August 24, 1814, led by General Robert Ross, a British force occupied Washington, D.C. and set fire to many public buildings following the American defeat at the Battle of Bladensburg. The facilities of the U.S. government, including the White House and U.S. Capitol, were largely destroyed. The British commander's orders to burn only public buildings and strict British discipline among its troops are credited with preserving the city's private buildings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/BurningofWashington1814.jpg/300px-BurningofWashington1814.jpg
