91.7	Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion	Bay of Pigs Invasion	The Bay of Pigs Invasion was an unsuccessful action by a CIA-trained force of Cuban exiles to invade southern Cuba, with support and encouragement from the US government, in an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro. The invasion was launched in April 1961, less than three months after John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency in the United States. The Cuban armed forces, trained and equipped by Eastern Bloc nations, defeated the invading combatants within three days.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/BayofPigs.jpg/300px-BayofPigs.jpg
