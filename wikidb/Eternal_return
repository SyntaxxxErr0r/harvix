70.8	Eternal_return	Eternal return	Eternal return (also known as "eternal recurrence") is a concept which posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. The concept, initially inherent in Indian philosophy, was later found in ancient Egypt and was subsequently taken up by the Pythagoreans and Stoics. With the decline of antiquity and the spread of Christianity, the concept fell into disuse in the western world, though Friedrich Nietzsche resurrected it as a thought experiment to argue for amor fati.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Egypt.KV6.04.jpg/220px-Egypt.KV6.04.jpg
