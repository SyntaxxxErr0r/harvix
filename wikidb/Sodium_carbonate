52.4	Sodium_carbonate	Sodium carbonate	Sodium carbonate (also known as washing soda or soda ash), Na2CO3 is a sodium salt of carbonic acid. It most commonly occurs as a crystalline heptahydrate, which readily effloresces to form a white powder, the monohydrate. Sodium carbonate is domestically well known for its everyday use as a water softener. It can be extracted from the ashes of many plants. It is synthetically produced in large quantities from salt and limestone in a process known as the Solvay process.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Sodium_carbonate.png/180px-Sodium_carbonate.png
