169.5	Paradigm_shift	Paradigm shift	A Paradigm shift (or revolutionary science) is, according to Thomas Kuhn in his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), a change in the basic assumptions, or paradigms, within the ruling theory of science. It is in contrast to his idea of normal science. According to Kuhn, "A paradigm is what members of a scientific community, and they alone, share." (The Essential Tension, 1977). Unlike a normal scientist, Kuhn held, "a student in the humanities has constantly before him a number of competing and incommensurable solutions to these problems, solutions that he must ultimately examine for himself." .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Duck-Rabbit_illusion.jpg/200px-Duck-Rabbit_illusion.jpg
