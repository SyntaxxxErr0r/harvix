73.7	Poultry	Poultry	Poultry is a category of domesticated birds kept by humans for the purpose of collecting their eggs, or killing for their meat and/or feathers. These most typically are members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails and turkeys) and the family Anatidae (in order Anseriformes), commonly known as "waterfowl" (e.g. domestic ducks and domestic geese). Poultry also includes other birds which are killed for their meat, such as pigeons or doves or birds considered to be game, like pheasants. Poultry comes from the French/Norman word, poule, itself derived from the Latin word Pullus, which means small animal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Poultry_exhibit%2C_Shreveport%2C_LA_IMG_3358.JPG/200px-Poultry_exhibit%2C_Shreveport%2C_LA_IMG_3358.JPG
