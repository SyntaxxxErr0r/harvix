125.0	Djembe	Djembe	A djembe ( -be) (also spelled djembé, jembe, jenbe, djimbe, jimbe, or dyinbe) is a rope-tuned skin-covered drum played with bare hands. According to the Bamana people in Mali, the name of the djembe comes from the saying "Anke djé, anke bé" which translates to "everyone gather together in peace" and defines the drum's purpose. In the Bambara language, "djé" is the verb for "gather" and "bé" translates as "peace".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Lenke_djembe_from_Mali.jpeg/166px-Lenke_djembe_from_Mali.jpeg
