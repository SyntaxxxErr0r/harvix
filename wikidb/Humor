54.0	Humor	Humour	Humour or humor (see spelling differences) is the tendency of particular cognitive experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humors (Latin: humor, "body fluid"), control human health and emotion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Eduard_von_Gr%C3%BCtzner_Falstaff.jpg/220px-Eduard_von_Gr%C3%BCtzner_Falstaff.jpg
