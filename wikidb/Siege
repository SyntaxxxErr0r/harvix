83.1	Siege	Siege	A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault. The term derives from sedere, Latin for "to sit". Generally speaking, siege warfare is a form of constant, low intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Ultimos_Momentos_en_Rancagua.jpg/300px-Ultimos_Momentos_en_Rancagua.jpg
