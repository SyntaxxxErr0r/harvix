2.10	Wilberforce_Colony	Wilberforce Colony	Gradually most of the Cincinnati leaders abandoned the colony within that first decade, and many of the leaders of the emigration movement, who had located in Wilberforce, left. By the late 1840s the Irish began moving into the area, and the Black population declined greatly. Eventually the Irish community supplanted Wilberforce altogether, and the town of Lucan was incorporated. Wilberforce as a free Black colony faded into history. By the end of the 20th century only a single family, that of Peter Butler, had descendants still in the area of the Wilberforce Colony village.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/ButlerWilberforce.jpg/150px-ButlerWilberforce.jpg
