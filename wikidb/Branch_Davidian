54.9	Branch_Davidian	Branch Davidians	The Branch Davidians (also known as "The Branch") are a Protestant sect that originated in 1955 from a schism in the Davidian Seventh Day Adventists ("Davidians"), a reform movement that began within the Seventh-day Adventist Church ("Adventists") around 1930. The majority of those who accepted the reform message have been disfellowshipped due to the Adventist church rejecting it. The Branch Davidians have many theological beliefs in common with Messianic Judaism	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Branch_Davidian_flag.svg/220px-Branch_Davidian_flag.svg.png
