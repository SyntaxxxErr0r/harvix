87.4	Retrovirus	Retrovirus	A retrovirus is an RNA virus that is duplicated in a host cell using the reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome. The DNA is then incorporated into the host's genome by an integrase enzyme. The virus thereafter replicates as part of the host cell's DNA. Retroviruses are enveloped viruses that belong to the viral family Retroviridae.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Phylogeny_of_Retroviruses.jpg/350px-Phylogeny_of_Retroviruses.jpg
