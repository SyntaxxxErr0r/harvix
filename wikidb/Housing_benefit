2.00	Housing_benefit	Housing Benefit	Housing Benefit is a means tested social security benefit in the UK that is intended to help meet Housing costs for rented accommodation. The primary legislation governing Housing Benefit is the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. Operationally, the governing Regulations are statutory instruments arising from that Act. It is governed by one of two sets of regulations. For working age claimants it is governed by the "Housing Benefit Regulations 2006", but for those who have reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit (regardless of whether it has been claimed) it is governed by the "Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006". It is normally administered, along with council tax benefit, by the local authority in whose area the property being rented lies. In some circumstances, normally council tenants in "out of Borough properties", some claimants may be required to obtain Housing Benefit from the borough that placed them and Council Tax Benefit from their Local Council. For those areas where there is two or more tier local government structure, Housing Benefit is administered by the District or Borough council layer of local government. This is generally the Council responsible for the billing of Council Tax.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/House_to_rent_no_dss.jpg/280px-House_to_rent_no_dss.jpg
