57.4	Gamma_ray_burst	Gamma-ray burst	Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of gamma rays associated with extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the most luminous electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several minutes; a typical burst lasts 20â€“40 seconds. The initial burst is usually followed by a longer-lived "afterglow" emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, microwave and radio).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Gamma_ray_burst.jpg/300px-Gamma_ray_burst.jpg
