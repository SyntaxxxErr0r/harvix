1.01	Permanent_wilting_point	Permanent wilting point	Permanent wilting point or wilting point (WP) is defined as the minimal point of soil moisture the plant requires not to wilt. If moisture decreases to this or any lower point a plant wilts and can no longer recover its turgidity when placed in a saturated atmosphere for 12 hours. The physical definition of the wilting point (symbolically expressed as θpwp or θwp) is defined as the water content at −1500 J/kg (or −15 bars) of suction pressure, or negative hydraulic head.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Permwiltpoint.JPG/220px-Permwiltpoint.JPG
