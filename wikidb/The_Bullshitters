1.00	The_Bullshitters	The Bullshitters: Roll Out The Gunbarrel	The Bullshitters: Roll Out The Gunbarrel was a spoof of The Professionals, first broadcast in 1984 on Channel 4. Although it was made by many people behind The Comic Strip, it did not feature the Comic Strip logo and is not considered by some to be part of the series. However, it was included in the Comic Strip DVD box set (2005), and its lead characters Bonehead and Foyle reappeared in a later Comic Strip episode, Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown.
