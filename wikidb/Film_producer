85.7	Film_producer	Film producer	An executive producer is usually a person representing a financial investor in a film project, such as a movie studio or a distributor, but who is not directly involved in the day-to-day production. It can also be someone with other special interests in the project, such as the author of the book that the film is based on, or one of the movie's key actors who has been instrumental in persuading the studio to do the movie. In such cases, the executive producer credit is mainly honorary.
