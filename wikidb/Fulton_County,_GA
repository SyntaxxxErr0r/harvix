3.11	Fulton_County,_GA	Fulton County, Georgia	Fulton County is a county located in the U.S. state of Georgia. Its county seat is Atlanta, the state capital since 1868, however, only 90% of the City of Atlanta is within Fulton County (the other 10% lies within DeKalb County). Fulton County is the principal county of the Atlanta metropolitan area. At the 2010 United States Census, the population was 920,581; however, Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed suspects significant undercounting in the City of Atlanta, which implies similar concerns for Fulton County as a whole â€“ the 2009 estimate of the county's population was 1,020,014, 10.8% higher than the 2010 census results.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/Fulton_co_cthse_2011.jpg/200px-Fulton_co_cthse_2011.jpg
