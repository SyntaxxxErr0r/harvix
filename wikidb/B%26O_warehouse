It was constructed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) beginning in 1899, with later sections completed in 1905, adjacent to the B&amp;O's Camden Station and freight yard at Camden and Eutaw streets. Often purported to be the longest brick building on the East Coast, the 1,116-foot (340 m) long, eight-story brick structure had 430,000 square feet (almost 40,000 mÂ²) of floor space for merchandise storage and distribution, large enough to hold 1,000 carloads of freight at a time, the B&amp;O advertised. Railroad historian Herbert H. Harwood proclaimed it an "awesome structure ... a truly classic turn-of-the-century railroad warehouse." The warehouse was used by the B&amp;O through the 1960s but was mostly vacant by the 1970s due to the use of trucks and newer, more efficient single-floor warehouses located in industrial parks elsewhere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Camden_Yards_MARC.jpg/220px-Camden_Yards_MARC.jpg
