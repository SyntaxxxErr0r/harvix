26.11	Seat_of_the_European_Parliament_in_Strasbourg	Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg	The city of Strasbourg (France) is the official seat of the European Parliament. The institution is legally bound to meet there twelve sessions a year lasting about four days each. Other work takes place in Brussels and Luxembourg City (see Location of European Union institutions for more information). Also all votes of the European Parliament must take place in Strasbourg. "Additional" sessions and committees take place in Brussels. Although de facto a majority of the Parliament's work is now geared to its Brussels site, it is legally bound to keep Strasbourg as its official home.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Plaque_comm%C3%A9morant_l%27inauguration_de_l%27immeuble_Louise_Weiss_du_Parlement_Europ%C3%A9en_%C3%A0_Strasbourg%2C_le_14_d%C3%A9cembre_1999.jpg/220px-Plaque_comm%C3%A9morant_l%27inauguration_de_l%27immeuble_Louise_Weiss_du_Parlement_Europ%C3%A9en_%C3%A0_Strasbourg%2C_le_14_d%C3%A9cembre_1999.jpg
