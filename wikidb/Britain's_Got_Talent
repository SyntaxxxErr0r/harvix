66.3	Britain's_Got_Talent	Britain's Got Talent	Britain's Got Talent (often shortened to BGT or Got Talent) is a British television talent show competition which started in June 2007 and originated from the Got Talent series. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Talkback Thames and Simon Cowell's production company SYCOtv. The show is broadcast on ITV in the UK and TV3 in the Republic of Ireland. The spin-off show Britain's Got More Talent is shown in both countries also. Anyone of age with some sort of talent to audition for the show can audition. Acts will compete against each other in order to gain the audience support while trying to win the title of "The winner of Britain's Got Talent". Each year, on the morning of the first show of the new series, Britain's Got Talent has a special program titled "Most Talented", featuring interviews of the winners from the previous series and their progress since winning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/Britain%27s_Got_Talent_title_card.png/300px-Britain%27s_Got_Talent_title_card.png
