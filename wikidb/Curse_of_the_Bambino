73.1	Curse_of_the_Bambino	Curse of the Bambino	The Curse of the Bambino was a superstition created because of the failure of the Boston Red Sox baseball team to win the World Series in the 86-year period from 1918 to 2004. While some fans took the curse seriously, most used the expression in a tongue-in-cheek manner.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Babe_Ruth_Red_Sox_1918.jpg/240px-Babe_Ruth_Red_Sox_1918.jpg
