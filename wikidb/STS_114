3.10	STS_114	STS-114	STS-114 was the first "Return to Flight" Space Shuttle mission following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. The Space Shuttle Discovery launched at 10:39 EDT (14:39 UTC), 26 July 2005. The launch, 907 days (approx. 29 months) after the loss of Columbia, was approved despite unresolved fuel sensor anomalies in the external tank; those anomalies had prevented the shuttle from launching on 13 July, its originally scheduled date.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/STS-114_patch.svg/201px-STS-114_patch.svg.png
