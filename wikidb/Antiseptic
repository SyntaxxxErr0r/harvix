54.3	Antiseptic	Antiseptic	Antiseptics (from Greek ἀντί: anti, '"against" + σηπτικός: sēptikos, "putrefactive") are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue/skin to reduce the possibility of infection, sepsis, or putrefaction. Antiseptics are generally distinguished from antibiotics by the latter's ability to be transported through the lymphatic system to destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants, which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Joseph_Lister.jpg/130px-Joseph_Lister.jpg
