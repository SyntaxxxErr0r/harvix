13.01	Bering_Strait_crossing	Bering Strait crossing	A Bering Strait crossing is a hypothetical bridge or tunnel spanning the relatively narrow and shallow Bering Strait between the Chukotka Peninsula in Russia and the Seward Peninsula in the U.S. state of Alaska. In principle, the bridge or tunnel would provide an overland connection linking Asia with North America, although there is little infrastructure in the nearby parts of Alaska and Russia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/BeringBridge.jpg/300px-BeringBridge.jpg
