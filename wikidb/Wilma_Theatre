2.20	Wilma_Theatre	Wilma Theatre	The Wilma Theatre was built in 1921 in Missoula, Montana. The theater is managed by Missoula based Simba Entertainment. The Wilma was built by William "Billy" Simons and dedicated to his wife, light opera artist Edna Wilma. The theater is part of an eight-story complex that was the first steel-framed high-rise building in Missoula, and includes the main 1066-seat hall, two 125-seat cinemas, three banquet rooms, a restaurant, apartments and offices. The theater now seats less patrons as four rows of seats were removed from the floor level in 2010. The theater interior is decorated with Louis XIV Style gilt trim. The International Wildlife Film Festival is held at the Wilma annually.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Missoula%2C_Montana_-_Wilma_Theater.JPG/250px-Missoula%2C_Montana_-_Wilma_Theater.JPG
