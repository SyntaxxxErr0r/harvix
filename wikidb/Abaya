72.6	Abaya	Abaya	The abaya "cloak" (Arabic: ‎ or , plural ), sometimes also called an aba, is a simple, loose over-garment, essentially a robe-like dress, worn by some women in parts of the Islamic world including in Turkey, North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Traditional abayat are black and may be either a large square of fabric draped from the shoulders or head or a long caftan. The abaya covers the whole body except the face, feet, and hands. It can be worn with the niqāb, a face veil covering all but the eyes. Some women choose to wear long black gloves, so their hands are covered as well.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Abayapair.jpg/220px-Abayapair.jpg
