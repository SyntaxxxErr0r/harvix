3.10	Northern_Mannerists	Northern Mannerism	Northern Mannerism is the term in European art history for the versions of Mannerism practiced in the visual arts north of the Alps in the 16th and early 17th century. Styles largely derived from Italian Mannerism were found in the Netherlands and elsewhere from around the mid-century, especially Mannerist ornament in architecture; this article concentrates on those times and places where Northern Mannerism generated its most original and distinctive work.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Bartholom%C3%A4us_Spranger_007.jpg/220px-Bartholom%C3%A4us_Spranger_007.jpg
