1.00	Allotment_garden	Allotment (gardening)	An allotment garden, often called simply an allotment, is a plot of land made available for individual, non-professional gardening. Such plots are formed by subdividing a piece of land into a few or up to several hundreds of land parcels that are assigned to individuals or families. In allotment gardens, the parcels are cultivated individually, contrary to other community garden types where the entire area is tended collectively by a group of people.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Z%C3%BCrich_-_K%C3%A4ferberg_-_Affoltern_IMG_3194.JPG/300px-Z%C3%BCrich_-_K%C3%A4ferberg_-_Affoltern_IMG_3194.JPG
