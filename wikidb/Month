56.9	Month	Month	A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, which was first used and invented in Mesopotamia, as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon; month and Moon are cognates. The traditional concept arose with the cycle of moon phases; such months are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days. From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Month_-_Knuckles_%28en%29.svg/300px-Month_-_Knuckles_%28en%29.svg.png
