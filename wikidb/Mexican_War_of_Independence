55.4	Mexican_War_of_Independence	Mexican War of Independence	The Mexican War of Independence (1810â€“1821) was an armed conflict between the people of Mexico and the Spanish colonial authorities which started on September 16, 1810. The movement, which became known as the Mexican War of Independence, was led by Mexican-born Spaniards, Mestizos and Amerindians who sought independence from Spain. It started as an idealistic peasants' rebellion against their colonial masters, but ended as an unlikely alliance between Mexican ex-royalists and Mexican guerrilla insurgents.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Batalla_del_Monte_de_las_Cruces-30_oct_1810-M%C3%A9xico.jpg/250px-Batalla_del_Monte_de_las_Cruces-30_oct_1810-M%C3%A9xico.jpg
