1.10	Agent_environment	Intelligent agent	In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent is an autonomous entity which observes through sensors and acts upon an environment using actuators (i.e. it is an agent) and directs its activity towards achieving goals (i.e. it is rational). Intelligent agents may also learn or use knowledge to achieve their goals. They may be very simple or very complex: a reflex machine such as a thermostat is an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is a community of human beings working together towards a goal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/IntelligentAgent-SimpleReflex.png/408px-IntelligentAgent-SimpleReflex.png
