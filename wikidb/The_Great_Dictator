81.5	The_Great_Dictator	The Great Dictator	The Great Dictator is a comedy film by Charlie Chaplin released in October 1940. Like most Chaplin films, he wrote, produced, and directed, in addition to starring as the lead. Having been the only Hollywood film maker to continue to make silent films well into the period of sound films, this was Chaplin's first true talking picture as well as his most commercially successful film.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/The_Great_Dictator.jpg/220px-The_Great_Dictator.jpg
