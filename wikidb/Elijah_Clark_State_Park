The park is named for Elijah Clarke, a frontiersman and Revolutionary War hero who led a force of pioneers in Georgia during the American Revolution. A newly renovated log cabin displays furniture and tools dating back to 1780. The park is also the site of the graves of Clark and his wife Hannah. The park's location on the lake makes it a haven for fishermen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/ElijahClarklocator.PNG/200px-ElijahClarklocator.PNG
