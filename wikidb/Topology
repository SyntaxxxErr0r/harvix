103.7	Topology	Topology	Topology (from the Greek τόπος, “place”, and λόγος, “study”) is a major area of mathematics concerned with properties that are preserved under continuous deformations of objects, such as deformations that involve stretching, but no tearing or gluing. It emerged through the development of concepts from geometry and set theory, such as space, dimension, and transformation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/M%C3%B6bius_strip.jpg/240px-M%C3%B6bius_strip.jpg
