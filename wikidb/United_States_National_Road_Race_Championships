They are run by the governing body, USA Cycling. Until 2006 the race was open to all nationalities, the first American to finish being named the winner and given a distinctive jersey. Since the championship in Greenville, South Carolina, in 2006, all riders have had to be American.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/MaillotUSA.PNG
