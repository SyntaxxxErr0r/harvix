1.01	Game_Maker_7	Game Maker	GameMaker (originally named Game Maker and often abbreviated to GM) is a Windows and Mac IDE originally developed by Mark Overmars in the Delphi programming language. It is currently developed and published by YoYo Games, a software company in which Overmars is involved. GameMaker allows users to easily develop computer games without the requirement of prior computer programming experience, while allowing advanced users to create complex applications much faster than possible with most other programming languages with its built-in scripting language.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/79/Gm8_new_logo.jpg/200px-Gm8_new_logo.jpg
