10.10	Yamaha_YM2413	Yamaha YM2413	The YM2413, aka OPLL, is a cost-reduced FM synthesis sound chip manufactured by Yamaha Corporation and based on their YM3812 (OPL2). To make the chip cheaper to manufacture, many of the internal registers were removed. The result of this is that the YM2413 can only play one user-defined instrument at a time; the other 15 instrument settings are hard-coded and cannot be altered by the user. There were other cost-cutting modifications: the number of waveforms was reduced to two, and an adder is not used to mix the channels; instead, the chip's DAC plays each channel one after the other, and the output of this is usually passed through an analog filter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/YM2413_01.jpg/220px-YM2413_01.jpg
