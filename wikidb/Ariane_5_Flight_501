55.1	Ariane_5_Flight_501	Cluster (spacecraft)	Cluster was a constellation of four European Space Agency spacecraft which were launched on the maiden flight of the Ariane 5 rocket, Flight 501, and subsequently lost when that rocket failed to achieve orbit. The launch, which took place on Tuesday, June 4, 1996, ended in failure due to an error in the software design caused by inadequate protection from integer overflow. This resulted in the rocket veering off its flight path 37 seconds after launch, beginning to disintegrate under high aerodynamic forces, and finally self-destructing by its automated flight termination system. The failure has become known as one of the most infamous software bugs in history. The failure resulted in a loss of more than US$370 million.
