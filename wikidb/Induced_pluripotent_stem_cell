72.6	Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell	Induced pluripotent stem cell	iPS cells are typically derived by transfection of certain stem cell-associated genes into non-pluripotent cells, such as adult fibroblasts, although this technique is becoming less popular since it is known to be prone to inducing cancer formation. Transfection is typically achieved through viral vectors, such as retroviruses. Transfected genes include the master transcriptional regulators Oct-3/4 (Pou5f1) and Sox2, although it is suggested that other genes enhance the efficiency of induction. After 3â€“4 weeks, small numbers of transfected cells begin to become morphologically and biochemically similar to pluripotent stem cells, and are typically isolated through morphological selection, doubling time, or through a reporter gene and antibiotic selection.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Dedifferentiation_Methods_%282010%29_-_Bischoff%2C_Steven_R.tif/lossy-page1-350px-Dedifferentiation_Methods_%282010%29_-_Bischoff%2C_Steven_R.tif.jpg
