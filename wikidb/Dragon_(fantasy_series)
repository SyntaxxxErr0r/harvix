4.10	Dragon_(fantasy_series)	Dragon (fantasy series)	The Dragon series is a tetralogy of fantasy novels by Chinese-American author Laurence Yep. Yep had already written several books including the Newbery Honor novel Dragonwings by 1980, when, after undertaking careful research, he decided to adapt Chinese mythology into a fantasy form, something he had always wanted to do since he had sold his first science fiction story at 18. He "tried to stay true to the spirit" of these myths, but did not try "to keep their exact details". The "perfect vehicle" he chose was a folktale in which the Monkey King captured a river spirit who had flooded an entire city, which he at first tried to conceive in picture book form.. However, he kept questioning the motivations of the river spirit, who he had renamed Civet. This resulted in the realization as his outline ballooned exponentially from eight to 800 pages that he would need a series as opposed to just one book to tell her story.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Ton_ngo_khong.jpg/220px-Ton_ngo_khong.jpg
