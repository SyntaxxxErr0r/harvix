3.00	Spring_Storm	Spring Storm	Spring Storm is a 1937 play written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Tennessee Williams wrote Spring Storm when he was twenty-six years old, in 1937, while studying as an apprentice. Spring Storm received poor reviews in Williamsâ€™s playwriting course, and it did not receive its first production until 1995 in Berkeley, California. The European premiere took place at the Royal &amp; Derngate Northampton on 15 October 2009, running alongside Beyond the Horizon by Eugene O'Neill. Both productions subsequently transferred to the Royal National Theatre in 2010 to the Cottesloe Theatre. Written and rewritten between 1937 and 1938, this full-length play depicts life and conflicted love in a small Mississippi Delta town during the Great Depression.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2e/Spring_storm_nationaltheatre.jpg
