2.10	Steve_Running	Steve Running	Steve Running, Regents Professor, Forest Ecology, College of Forestry &amp; Conservation at the University of Montana, and Director of the Numerical Terradynamics Simulation Group, is responsible for developing the earth observing-oriented algorithms used by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASAâ€™s satellites, Terra and Aqua. He continues to be the lead investigator on this project. Running's MOD17 algorithms are used to provide accurate and continuous global monitoring of the terrestrial biosphere, specifically, generating near-real-time data sets for repeated monitoring of vegetation primary production on vegetated land at 1-km resolution at 8-day intervals. These datasets are unique in that they provide global data on primary productivity and span a decade.
