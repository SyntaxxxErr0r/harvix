73.1	Genie	Jinn	Jinn or genies are supernatural creatures in Arab folklore and Islamic mythology that occupy a parallel world to that of mankind. Together, jinn, humans and angels make up the three sentient creations of Allah. Religious sources say barely anything about them; however, the Qur'an mentions that Jinn are made of smokeless flame or "scorching fire". Like human beings, the Jinn can also be good, evil, or neutrally benevolent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Descending_into_cave.jpg/220px-Descending_into_cave.jpg
