54.3	Haplogroup	Haplogroup	In molecular evolution, a haplogroup (from the Greek: , haplo√ªs, "onefold, single, simple") is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor having the same single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation in both haplotypes. Because a haplogroup consists of similar haplotypes, this is what makes it possible to predict a haplogroup from haplotypes. A SNP test confirms a haplogroup. Haplogroups are assigned letters of the alphabet, and refinements consist of additional number and letter combinations, for example R1b1. Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups have different haplogroup designations. Haplogroups pertain to deep ancestral origins dating back thousands of years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Molecular_lineage.png/250px-Molecular_lineage.png
