85.6	Utility	Utility	In economics, utility is a measure of satisfaction, referring to the total satisfaction received by a consumer from consuming a good or service. Given this measure, one may speak meaningfully of increasing or decreasing utility, and thereby explain economic behavior in terms of attempts to increase one's utility. Utility is often modeled to be affected by consumption of various goods and services, possession of wealth and spending of leisure time.
