It operated from 1935 to 1939 as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Following the passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939, the NYA was transferred from the WPA to the Federal Security Agency. In 1942, the NYA was transferred to the War Manpower Commission (WMC). The NYA officially folded in 1943.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/NYA_Poster_Illinois_1937.jpg/250px-NYA_Poster_Illinois_1937.jpg
