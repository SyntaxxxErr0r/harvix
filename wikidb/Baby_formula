8.33	Baby_formula	Infant formula	Infant formula is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water). The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) defines infant formula as "a food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants by reason of its simulation of human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milk".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Infant_with_baby_bottle.jpg/250px-Infant_with_baby_bottle.jpg
