13.12	Herbig-Haro_objects	Herbig–Haro object	Herbig–Haro objects are small patches of nebulosity associated with newly born stars, and are formed when gas ejected by young stars collides with clouds of gas and dust nearby at speeds of several hundred kilometres per second. Herbig–Haro objects are ubiquitous in star-forming regions, and several are often seen around a single star, aligned along its rotational axis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Heic0411a.jpg/145px-Heic0411a.jpg
