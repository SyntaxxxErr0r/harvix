69.9	Picnic	Picnic	In contemporary usage, a picnic can be defined simply as a pleasure excursion at which a meal is eaten outdoors , ideally taking place in a beautiful landscape such as a park, beside a lake or with an interesting view and possibly at a public event such as before an open air theatre performance, and usually in summer. Descriptions of picnics show that the idea of a meal that was jointly contributed and was enjoyed out-of-doors were essential to a picnic from the early 19th century.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Thomas_Cole%27s_%22The_Picnic%22%2C_Brooklyn_Museum_IMG_3787.JPG/250px-Thomas_Cole%27s_%22The_Picnic%22%2C_Brooklyn_Museum_IMG_3787.JPG
