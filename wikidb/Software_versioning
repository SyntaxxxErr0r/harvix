53.5	Software_versioning	Software versioning	Software versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software. Within a given version number category (major, minor), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software. At a fine-grained level, revision control is often used for keeping track of incrementally different versions of electronic information, whether or not this information is actually computer software.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/VersionNumbers.svg/125px-VersionNumbers.svg.png
