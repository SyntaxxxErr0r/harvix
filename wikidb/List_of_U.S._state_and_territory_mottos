21.21	List_of_U.S._state_and_territory_mottos	List of U.S. state and territory mottos	All of the United States' 50 states have a state motto, as do the District of Columbia and three US territories. A motto is a phrase meant to formally describe the general motivation or intention of an organization. State mottos can sometimes be found on state seals or state flags. Some states have officially designated a state motto by an act of the state legislature, whereas other states have the motto only as an element of their seals. The motto of the United States itself is In God We Trust, proclaimed by Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on July 30, 1956. The motto E Pluribus Unum (Latin for "One from many") was approved for use on the Great Seal of the United States in 1782, but was never adopted as the national motto through legislative action.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Seal_of_Colorado.svg/170px-Seal_of_Colorado.svg.png
