61.1	Contras	Contras	The contras (some references use the capitalized form, "Contras") is a label given to the various rebel groups opposing Nicaragua's FSLN Sandinista Junta of National Reconstruction government following the July 1979 overthrow of Anastasio Somoza Debayle's dictatorship. Among the separate contra groups, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) emerged as by far the largest. In 1987, virtually all contra organizations were united, at least nominally, into the Nicaraguan Resistance.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Frente_Sur_Contras_1987.jpg/180px-Frente_Sur_Contras_1987.jpg
