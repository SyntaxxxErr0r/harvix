3.11	Big_Bam_Boom	Big Bam Boom	Big Bam Boom was the twelfth studio album by Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates, released on RCA late in 1984. It marked the end of one of the most successful album runs by a duo of the 1980s. The album is also considered a record that defines the sound of the 1980s. BMG Heritage released a remastered version in July 2004 with four bonus tracks. The song "Out Of Touch" (the first single) was a #1 pop hit, and charted in several other areas (#24 Hot Black Singles, #8 on the Adult Contemporary charts and #1 on the dance charts, #48 in the UK). Another song taken from the album, the Daryl Hall/Janna Allen-penned "Method Of Modern Love" reached a high point of #5.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Hall_Oates_BigBamBoom.jpg/220px-Hall_Oates_BigBamBoom.jpg
