104.6	Albedo	Albedo	Albedo ( ), or reflection coefficient, derived from Latin albedo "whiteness" (or reflected sunlight), in turn from albus "white", is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a dimensionless fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Albedo-e_hg.svg/220px-Albedo-e_hg.svg.png
