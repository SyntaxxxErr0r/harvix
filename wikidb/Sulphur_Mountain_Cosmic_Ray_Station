1.10	Sulphur_Mountain_Cosmic_Ray_Station	Sulphur Mountain Cosmic Ray Station	Sulphur Mountain Cosmic Ray Station, a National Historic Site of Canada found atop Sulphur Mountain in Banff National Park, commemorates Canada's participation in the International Geophysical Year, during 1957 to 1958. Canada constructed nine sites to study cosmic rays, but this site in particular was the most important due to its higher elevation. The National Research Council constructed a laboratory at the site in the winter of 1956-57. The building was not visible from the Banff townsite as a condition of its construction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Sulphur_Mtn_Cosmic_Ray_Station.jpg/270px-Sulphur_Mtn_Cosmic_Ray_Station.jpg
