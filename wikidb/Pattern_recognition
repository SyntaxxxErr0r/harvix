57.7	Pattern_recognition	Pattern recognition	In machine learning, pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. An example of pattern recognition is classification, which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes (for example, determine whether a given email is "spam" or "non-spam"). However, pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are regression, which assigns a real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing, which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/800px-Cool_Kids_of_Death_Off_Festival_p_146-face_selected.jpg/200px-800px-Cool_Kids_of_Death_Off_Festival_p_146-face_selected.jpg
