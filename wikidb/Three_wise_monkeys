57.2	Three_wise_monkeys	Three wise monkeys	The three wise monkeys (Japanese: 三猿, san'en or sanzaru, or 三匹の猿, sanbiki no saru, literally "three monkeys"), sometimes called the three mystic apes, are a pictorial maxim. Together they embody the proverbial principle to "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil". The three monkeys are Mizaru, covering his eyes, who sees no evil; Kikazaru, covering his ears, who hears no evil; and Iwazaru, covering his mouth, who speaks no evil. Sometimes there is a fourth monkey depicted with the three others; the last one, Shizaru, symbolizes the principle of "do no evil". He may be shown crossing his arms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Hear_speak_see_no_evil_Toshogu.jpg/300px-Hear_speak_see_no_evil_Toshogu.jpg
