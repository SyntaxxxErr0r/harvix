59.6	Passive_solar	Passive solar building design	In passive solar building design, windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design or climatic design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it doesn't involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Illust_passive_solar_d1.gif/280px-Illust_passive_solar_d1.gif
