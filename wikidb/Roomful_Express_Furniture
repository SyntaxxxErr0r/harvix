The company was founded in 1958 by Robert Kuhn as Freight Liquidators for the original purpose of importing Italian furniture and then reselling it to independent dealers. The company evolved from a third-party distributor that was centrally based in a warehouse on Pittsburgh's North Side into a "big box" furniture store by purchasing stock from one of its primary customers, Gimbels Department Store. The first stand-alone store was opened in 1973. The company now has annual sales of around $78 million and employs 350.
