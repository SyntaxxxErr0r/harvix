73.7	One-time_password	One-time password	A time-synchronized OTP is usually related to a piece of hardware called a security token (e.g., each user is given a personal token that generates a one-time password). Inside the token is an accurate clock that has been synchronized with the clock on the proprietary authentication server. On these OTP systems, time is an important part of the password algorithm since the generation of new passwords is based on the current time rather than, or in addition to, the previous password or a secret key. This token may be a proprietary device, or a mobile phone or similar mobile device which runs software that is proprietary, freeware, or open-source. An example of time-synchronized OTP standard is TOTP.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/RSA-SecurID-Tokens.jpg/220px-RSA-SecurID-Tokens.jpg
