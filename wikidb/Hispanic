153.2	Hispanic	Hispanic	Hispanic is a term that originally denoted a relationship to Hispania - an ancient designation for the Iberian Peninsula. Over time, the term Hispanic has evolved from the ancient usage, now more broadly referring to any cultural connection to Spain. Specifically, the term describes the culture and people of countries formerly ruled by the Spanish Empire, usually with a majority Hispanophone (Spanish-speaking) population. This area includes Hispanic America or Latin America - including Mexico, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central and South America, and the Spanish-speaking island-nations of the Caribbean - but also includes other, non-American areas, such as Equatorial Guinea in Africa, and the Spanish East Indies. The degree to which the countries of the former Portuguese Empire, or Spain and Portugal themselves are included in the definition of the term can vary considerably.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Flag_of_the_Hispanicity.svg/220px-Flag_of_the_Hispanicity.svg.png
