7.00	Bell-ringer	Bell-ringer	A bell-ringer is a person who rings, tolls or peals a large bell, usually a church bell, by tugging on a long rope. Since the invention of the carillon, the need for bell ringers has declined. Also some churches have replaced bell-ringing altogether with a loudspeaker that plays bell music from a computer or music player.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Church_bell_cutaway.png/150px-Church_bell_cutaway.png
