60.7	Monterey_Pop_Festival	Monterey Pop Festival	The festival was the subject of an acclaimed documentary movie entitled Monterey Pop by noted documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker. Pennebaker's team used newly developed portable 16mm color cameras equipped to record synchronized sound. Sound was captured by Wally Heider's mobile studio on state-of-the art eight-track tape. The Grateful Dead believed that this was too commercial and refused permission to be shown in the film. The screening of the film in theaters nationwide helped raise the festival to mythic status, rapidly swelled the ranks of would-be festival-goers looking for the next festival, and inspired new entrepreneurs to stage more and more of them around the country.
