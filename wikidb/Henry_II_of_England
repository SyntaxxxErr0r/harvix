89.6	Henry_II_of_England	Henry II of England	Henry II (5 March 1133 – 6 July 1189), also known as Henry Curtmantle, Henry FitzEmpress or Henry Plantagenet, ruled as King of England (1154–89), Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Duke of Normandy, Duke of Aquitaine, Count of Nantes, and Lord of Ireland and, at various times, controlled Wales, Scotland and Brittany. Henry was the son of Geoffrey of Anjou and Matilda, who took the title of Empress from her first marriage. He became actively involved in his mother's efforts to claim the throne of England by the age of 14, and was made the Duke of Normandy at 17. He inherited Anjou in 1151 and shortly afterwards married Eleanor of Aquitaine, whose marriage to the French king Louis VII had recently been annulled. Henry's military expedition to England in 1153 led to King Stephen agreeing to a peace treaty and Henry inheriting the kingdom on Stephen's death a year later. Still quite young, he now controlled what would later be called the Angevin empire stretching across much of western Europe.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Parents_of_Henry_II.jpg/250px-Parents_of_Henry_II.jpg
