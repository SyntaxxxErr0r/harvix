15.60	Elephant_man	Joseph Merrick	Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 â€“ 11 April 1890), sometimes incorrectly referred to as John Merrick, was an English man with severe deformities who was exhibited as a human curiosity named the Elephant Man. He became well known in London society after he went to live at the London Hospital. Merrick was born in Leicester and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life. His skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed an enlargement of his lips, and a bony lump grew on his forehead. One of his arms and both feet became enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip, resulting in permanent lameness. When he was 11, his mother died and his father soon remarried. Merrick left school at 12, and had difficulty finding employment. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home. In late 1879, aged 17, Merrick entered the Leicester Union workhouse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Joseph_Merrick_carte_de_visite_photo%2C_c._1889.jpg/220px-Joseph_Merrick_carte_de_visite_photo%2C_c._1889.jpg
