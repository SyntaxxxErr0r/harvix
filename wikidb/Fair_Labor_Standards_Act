79.9	Fair_Labor_Standards_Act	Fair Labor Standards Act	In 1946, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co. that preliminary work activities, where controlled by the employer and performed entirely for the employer's benefit, are properly included as working time under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The decision is known as the "portal to portal act." The 1947 Portal-to-Portal Act specified exactly what type of time was considered compensable work time. In general, as long as an employee is engaging in activities that benefit the employer, regardless of when they're performed, the employer has an obligation to pay the employee for his or her time. It also specified that travel to and from the work place was a normal incident of employment and shouldn't be considered paid working time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/History_of_US_federal_minimum_wage_increases.svg/400px-History_of_US_federal_minimum_wage_increases.svg.png
