4.40	Mahale_Mountains_National_Park	Mahale Mountains National Park	Mahale Mountains National Park lies on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in western Tanzania. Named after the Mahale Mountains range that is within its borders, the park has several unusual characteristics. First, it is one of only two protected areas for chimpanzees in the country. (The other is nearby Gombe Stream National Park made famous by the researcher Jane Goodall.) Another unusual feature of the park is that it is one of the very few in Africa that must be experienced by foot. There are no roads or other infrastructure within the park boundaries, and the only way in and out of the park is via boat on the lake.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/MahaleMtsNP_ETM%2B_2001-10-01.jpg/284px-MahaleMtsNP_ETM%2B_2001-10-01.jpg
