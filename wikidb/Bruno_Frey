Frey has written, co-written or edited more than a dozen books and has written more than 350 journal articles, mostly in economics journals, but also in political science, sociology and psychology. In 2011, Frey was criticised for and admitted to self-plagiarism on his work relating to the Titanic disaster.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/File-Bruno_Frey_2010b_crop.jpg/220px-File-Bruno_Frey_2010b_crop.jpg
