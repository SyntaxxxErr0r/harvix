4.20	Malltraeth	Malltraeth	Malltraeth (origin: Mall (corrupt, blasted, desolate, + Traeth (beach)) is a small village in the southwest of Anglesey, in the area of Bodorgan. It is now at the end of a large bay, which used to extend much further inland, almost creating a second sea strait in the area (the Menai Strait broke through following the end of the ice age).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Malltraeth.jpg/220px-Malltraeth.jpg
