73.4	Multilingualism	Multilingualism	Multilingualism is the act of using, or promoting the use of, multiple languages, either by an individual speaker or by a community of speakers. Multilingual speakers outnumber monolingual speakers in the world's population. Multilingualism is becoming a social phenomenon governed by the needs of globalization and cultural openness. Thanks to the ease of access to information facilitated by the Internet, individuals' exposure to multiple languages is getting more and more frequent, and triggering therefore the need to acquire more and more languages.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/SeattleTrashLeseRacBasura200511_KaihsuTai.jpg/220px-SeattleTrashLeseRacBasura200511_KaihsuTai.jpg
