1.00	Ekoid_languages	Ekoid languages	The Ekoid languages are a dialect cluster, such as Ekajuk and Ejagham (Ekoi), spoken principally in southeastern Nigeria and in adjacent regions of Cameroon. They have long been associated with the Bantu languages, without their status being precisely defined. Crabb (1969) remains the major monograph on these languages, although regrettably, Part II, which was to contain grammatical analyses, was never published. Crabb also reviews the literature on Ekoid up to the date of publication.
