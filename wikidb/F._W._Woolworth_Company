59.3	F._W._Woolworth_Company	F. W. Woolworth Company	The F. W. Woolworth Company (often referred to as Woolworth's or Woolworth, or occasionally Woolsworth or just Woolies) was a retail company that was one of the original American five-and-dime stores. The first successful Woolworth store was opened on July 18, 1879 by Frank Winfield Woolworth in Lancaster, Pennsylvania as "Woolworth's Great Five Cent Store". Soon, Frank brought his brother, Charles Sumner Woolworth, whom everyone called Sum, into the business. With $127.50 Frank opened a second "Woolworth's Great Five Cent Store" in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania which was then managed by Sum. Sum worked with Frank at the Augsbury and Moore dry goods store in Watertown, New York and had also managed a Augsbury and Moore store in Morristown, New York. Business in Harrisburg flourished, and soon the landlord wanted to raise the rent. Rather than pay more in rent, Frank and Sum moved the store to York, Pennsylvania then to Scranton, Pennsylvania, a city which Sum quickly loved. Frank had tested a small line of ten-cent items at his Lancaster store. So when the Scranton store opened, the sign read "5¢ &amp; 10¢ WOOLWORTH BRO'S STORE" thus becoming the first five-and-ten-cent (dime) store in the world at 125 Penn Ave. While Frank traveled a lot to expand the business, Sum perfected the merchandising formula in Scranton. He based his operations in the Pennsylvania coal town and remained in Scranton during his decades as Chairman of F. W. Woolworth. Despite growing to be one of the largest retail chains in the world through most of the 20th century, increased competition led to its decline beginning in the 1980s. The chain went out of business in July 1997, when the company decided to focus on the Foot Locker division and renamed itself Venator Group. By 2001, the company focused exclusively on the sporting goods market, changing its name to the present Foot Locker Inc .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Woolworth_Logo.svg/275px-Woolworth_Logo.svg.png
