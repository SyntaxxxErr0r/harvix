82.6	Bodybuilding	Bodybuilding	Bodybuilding is a form of body modification involving intensive muscle hypertrophy. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In competitive and professional bodybuilding, bodybuilders display their physiques to a panel of judges, who assign points based on their appearance. Bodybuilders prepare for competition through a combination of fat loss, oils, and tanning (or tanning lotions) which combined with lighting make the definition of the muscle group more distinct.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Falk%2C_Benjamin_J._%281853-1925%29_-_Eugen_Sandow_%281867-1925%29.jpg/190px-Falk%2C_Benjamin_J._%281853-1925%29_-_Eugen_Sandow_%281867-1925%29.jpg
