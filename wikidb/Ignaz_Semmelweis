98.5	Ignaz_Semmelweis	Ignaz Semmelweis	Ignaz Philipp SemmelweisNote 1 (July 1, 1818 – August 13, 1865) was a Hungarian physician now known as an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures. Described as the "savior of mothers", Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics. Puerperal fever was common in mid-19th-century hospitals and often fatal, with mortality at 10%–35%. Semmelweis postulated the theory of washing with chlorinated lime solutions in 1847 while working in Vienna General Hospital's First Obstetrical Clinic, where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of midwives' wards. He published a book of his findings in Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Ignaz_Semmelweis_1860.jpg/225px-Ignaz_Semmelweis_1860.jpg
