65.3	Aesthetic	Aesthetics	Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of beauty, art, and taste, and with the creation and appreciation of beauty. It is more scientifically defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste. More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and nature."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/Philbar.png/158px-Philbar.png
