1.00	Ptisana_purpurascens	Ptisana purpurascens	Ptisana purpurascens is a large fern belonging to the botanical family Marattiaceae. It has a globular rhizome with stipule-like fleshy outgrowths. The leaves are dark green, twice pinnate and up to 1 metre long. Every pinnule has up to six pairs of leaflets. The petioles are dark-purplish, hence the name 'purpurascens' meaning 'becoming purple'. The sporangia are fused in all Ptisana into a bivalvate synangium.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Marattia_purpurascens_JdP.jpg/220px-Marattia_purpurascens_JdP.jpg
