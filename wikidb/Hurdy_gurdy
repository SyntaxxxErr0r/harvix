62.9	Hurdy_gurdy	Hurdy gurdy	The hurdy gurdy or hurdy-gurdy is a stringed musical instrument that produces sound by a crank-turned rosined wheel rubbing against the strings. The wheel functions much like a violin bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound similar to a violin. Melodies are played on a keyboard that presses tangents (small wedges, typically made of wood) against one or more of the strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a sound board to make the vibration of the strings audible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Louvet_Drehleier.JPG/250px-Louvet_Drehleier.JPG
