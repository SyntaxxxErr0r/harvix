The team plays their home games at Bowen Field, a historic stadium (opened in 1939) in Bluefield's city park. The park, which straddles the West Virginiaâ€“Virginia state line, is operated by the West Virginia city; however, Bowen Field lies entirely within Virginia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b0/BluefieldBlueJays.PNG/100px-BluefieldBlueJays.PNG
