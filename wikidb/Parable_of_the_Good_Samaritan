62.6	Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan	Parable of the Good Samaritan	The parable of the Good Samaritan is a parable told by Jesus and is mentioned in only one of the Canonical gospels of the New Testament. According to the Gospel of Luke a traveller (who may or may not be Jewish) is beaten, robbed, and left half dead along the road. First a priest and then a Levite come by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a Samaritan comes by. Samaritans and Jews generally despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man. Jesus is described as telling the parable in response to a question regarding the identity of the "neighbour" which Leviticus 19:18 says should be loved.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Cl-Fd_Saint-Eutrope-vitrail1.jpg/200px-Cl-Fd_Saint-Eutrope-vitrail1.jpg
