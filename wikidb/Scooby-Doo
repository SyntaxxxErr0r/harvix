80.2	Scooby-Doo	Scooby-Doo	Scooby-Doo is an American cartoon series based around several animated television series and related works produced from 1969 to the present day. The original series, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, was created for Hanna-Barbera Productions by writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears in 1969. This Saturday morning cartoon series featured four teenagers — Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville "Shaggy" Rogers — who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps. Hanna-Barbera took the basic idea and felt it needed something to add humor to the cartoon and make it less frightening. Iwao Takamoto believed it should be a dog - a big dog. And what bigger dog than a Great Dane. So he created Scooby-Doo. After speaking with professional breeder of Great Danes, Iwao went the opposite direction and gave Scooby bow legs and floppy ears. The name was derived from the Frank Sinatra song "Strangers in the Night". When Fred Silverman heard it, he was hooked on the ending and named the Great Dane Scooby-Doo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Scooby-gang-1969.jpg/250px-Scooby-gang-1969.jpg
