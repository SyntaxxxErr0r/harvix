153.6	Archaeology	Archaeology	Archaeology, or archeology (from Greek , archaiologia â€“ , arkhaios, "ancient"; and , -logia, "-logy"), is the study of human society, primarily through the recovery and analysis of the material culture and environmental data that they have left behind, which includes artifacts, architecture, biofacts and cultural landscapes (the archaeological record). Because archaeology employs a wide range of different procedures, it can be considered to be both a science and a humanity, and in the United States it is thought of as a branch of anthropology, although in Europe it is viewed as a separate discipline.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Dolina-Pano-3.jpg/220px-Dolina-Pano-3.jpg
