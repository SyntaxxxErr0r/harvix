65.6	United_States_Reports	United States Reports	The United States Reports are the official record of the rulings, orders, case tables , and other proceedings of the Supreme Court of the United States. Opinions of the court in each case, prepended with a headnote prepared by the Reporter of Decisions, and any concurring or dissenting opinions are published sequentially. The Court's Publication Office oversees the binding and publication of the volumes of United States Reports, although the actual printing, binding, and publication are performed by private firms under contract with the United States Government Printing Office.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Unitedstatesreports.jpg/250px-Unitedstatesreports.jpg
