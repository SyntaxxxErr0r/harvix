236.8	Compiler	Compiler	A compiler is a computer program (or set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language, often having a binary form known as object code). The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an executable program.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Compiler.svg/300px-Compiler.svg.png
