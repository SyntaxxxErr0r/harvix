Its lyric, told from the point of view of a one-time millionaire during the Prohibition era, reflects on the fleeting nature of material wealth and the friendships that come and go with it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Nobody_Knows_You_When_You%27re_Down_and_Out_single_cover.jpg/220px-Nobody_Knows_You_When_You%27re_Down_and_Out_single_cover.jpg
