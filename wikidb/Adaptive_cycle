3.00	Adaptive_cycle	Adaptive management	Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation lay out 5 main steps to an adaptive management project cycle (see Figure 1). The Open Standards represent a compilation and adaptation of best practices and guidelines across several fields and across several organizations within the conservation community. Since the release of the initial Open Standards (updated in 2007), thousands of project teams from conservation organizations (e.g., TNC, Rare, and WWF), local conservation groups, and donors alike have begun applying these Open Standards to their work. In addition, several CMP members have developed training materials and courses to help apply the Standards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/CMP_Cycle_-_2008-02-20.jpg/220px-CMP_Cycle_-_2008-02-20.jpg
