2.00	Romanus_(Bishop_of_Rochester)	Romanus (Bishop of Rochester)	Romanus (died before AD 627) was the second bishop of Rochester and presumably was a member of the Gregorian mission sent to Kent to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. Romanus was consecrated bishop around 624 and died before 627 by drowning. Little is known of his life beyond these facts.
