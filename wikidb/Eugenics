234.6	Eugenics	Eugenics	Eugenics is the "applied science or the bio-social movement which advocates the use of practices aimed at improving the genetic composition of a population", usually referring to the manipulation of human populations. The origins of the concept of eugenics began with certain interpretations of Mendelian inheritance, and the theories of August Weismann. Historically, many of the practitioners of eugenics viewed eugenics as a science, not necessarily restricted to human populations; this embraced the views of Darwinism and Social Darwinism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Eugenics_congress_logo.png/275px-Eugenics_congress_logo.png
