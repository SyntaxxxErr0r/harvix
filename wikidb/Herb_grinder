1.01	Herb_grinder	Herb grinder	An herb grinder (also called a "bud grinder", or just a "grinder") is a cylindrical contraption with two halves (top and bottom) that separate and have sharp teeth or pegs aligned in such a way that when both halves are turned, material inside—typically spice —is shredded, resulting in a product that tastes less strong.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Metal_herb_grinder-cannabis_inside.JPG/180px-Metal_herb_grinder-cannabis_inside.JPG
