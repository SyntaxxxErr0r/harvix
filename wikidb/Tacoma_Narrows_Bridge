88.7	Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge	Tacoma Narrows Bridge	The Tacoma Narrows Bridge is a pair of twin suspension bridges in the U.S. state of Washington, which carry State Route 16 (known as Primary State Highway 14 until 1964) across the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula. Historically, the name "Tacoma Narrows Bridge" has applied to the original bridge nicknamed "Galloping Gertie" which opened in July 1940 but it collapsed due to aeroelastic flutter four months later, as well as the replacement of the original bridge which opened in 1950 and still stands today as the westbound lanes of the present-day twin bridge complex.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_2009.jpg/250px-Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_2009.jpg
