58.5	Ramana_Maharshi	Ramana Maharshi	Sri Ramana Maharshi (Tamil: ரமண மஹரிஷி) (January 9, 1879 – April 14, 1950), born Venkataraman Iyer, was a Hindu spiritual master ("jnani"). He was born to a Tamil-speaking Brahmin family in Tiruchuzhi, Tamil Nadu. After experiencing at age 16 what he later described as liberation (moksha), he left home for Arunachala, a mountain considered sacred by Hindus. He lived at the mountain for the rest of his life. Although born a Brahmin, he declared himself an "Atiasrami", a Sastraic state of non-attachment to anything in life and beyond all caste restrictions. The ashram that grew around him, Sri Ramana Ashram, is situated at the foothill of Arunchala, to the west to the pilgrimage town of Tiruvannamalai.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Ramana_3_sw.jpg/220px-Ramana_3_sw.jpg
