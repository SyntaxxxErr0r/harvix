88.1	Head-up_display	Head-up display	A head-up display or heads-up display—also known as a HUD—is any transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints. The origin of the name stems from a pilot being able to view information with the head positioned "up" and looking forward, instead of angled down looking at lower instruments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/HUD_view.jpg/220px-HUD_view.jpg
