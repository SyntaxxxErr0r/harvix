50.12	Integrated_Services_Digital_Network	Integrated Services Digital Network	Integrated Services Digital Network is a set of communications standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network. It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT red book. Prior to ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way to transport voice, with some special services available for data. The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines, adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. There are several kinds of access interfaces to ISDN defined as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI) and Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/DBP_1988_1368_ISDN.jpg/220px-DBP_1988_1368_ISDN.jpg
