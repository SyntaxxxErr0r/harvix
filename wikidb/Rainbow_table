135.7	Rainbow_table	Rainbow table	A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering the plaintext password, up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a form of time-memory tradeoff, using less CPU at the cost of more storage. Proper key derivation functions employ a salt to make this attack infeasible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Rainbow_table1.svg/550px-Rainbow_table1.svg.png
