132.7	Security	Security	Security is the degree of protection against danger, damage, loss, and crime. Security as a form of protection are structures and processes that provide or improve security as a condition. The Institute for Security and Open Methodologies in the OSSTMM 3 defines security as "a form of protection where a separation is created between the assets and the threat". This includes but is not limited to the elimination of either the asset or the threat. Security as a national condition was defined in a United Nations study (1986) , so that countries can develop and progress safely.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Security_at_United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg/220px-Security_at_United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg
