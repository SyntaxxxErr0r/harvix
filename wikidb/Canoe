56.6	Canoe	Canoe	A canoe or Canadian canoe (British English) is a small narrow boat, typically human-powered, though it may also be powered by sails or small electric or gas motors. Canoes are usually pointed at both bow and stern and are normally open on top, but can be decked over (i.e. covered, similar to a kayak).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Morris-canoe-600.jpg/220px-Morris-canoe-600.jpg
