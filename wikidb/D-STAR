While there are other digital on-air technologies being used by amateurs that have come from other services, D-Star is one of the first on-air and packet-based standards to be widely deployed and sold by a major radio manufacturer that is designed specifically for amateur service use.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/ICOM_IC-91AD_D-STAR_handheld_transceiver.jpeg/220px-ICOM_IC-91AD_D-STAR_handheld_transceiver.jpeg
