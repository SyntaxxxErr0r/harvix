60.7	Crime_fiction	Crime fiction	Crime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalises crimes, their detection, criminals and their motives. It is usually distinguished from mainstream fiction and other genres such as science fiction or historical fiction, but boundaries can be, and indeed are, blurred. It has several sub-genres, including detective fiction (such as the whodunnit), legal thriller, courtroom drama and hard-boiled fiction.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Paget_holmes.png
