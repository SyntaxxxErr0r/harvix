8.31	Holophony	Wave field synthesis	Wave field synthesis (WFS) is a spatial audio rendering technique, characterized by creation of virtual acoustic environments. It produces "artificial" wave fronts synthesized by a large number of individually driven speakers. Such wave fronts seem to originate from a virtual starting point, the virtual source or notional source. Contrary to traditional spatialization techniques such as stereo, the localization of virtual sources in WFS does not depend on or change with the listener's position.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Principle_wfs.jpg/400px-Principle_wfs.jpg
