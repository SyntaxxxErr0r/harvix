The events began in December 2010 and led to the ousting of longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011 eventually leading to a thorough democratization of the country and to free and democratic elections which saw the victory of a coalition of the islamist Ennahda Movement with the Centre-Left Congress for the Republic and the Left-leaning Ettakatol as junior partners.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Caravane_de_la_lib%C3%A9ration_4.jpg/200px-Caravane_de_la_lib%C3%A9ration_4.jpg
