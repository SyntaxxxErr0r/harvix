132.1	Lucy_(Australopithecus)	Lucy (Australopithecus)	Lucy is the common name of AL 288-1, several hundred pieces of bone representing about 40% of the skeleton of an individual Australopithecus afarensis. The specimen was discovered in 1974 at Hadar in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia's Afar Depression. Lucy is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago. The discovery of this hominin was significant as the skeleton shows evidence of small skull capacity akin to that of apes and of bipedal upright walk akin to that of humans, providing further evidence supporting the view that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size in human evolution, though other findings have been interpreted as suggesting that Australopithecus afarensis was not directly ancestral to humans. In 1992, a new hominin, Ardi, was found, pushing back the earliest known hominin date to 4.4 million years ago, although details of this discovery were not published until October 2009.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Lucy_blackbg.jpg/220px-Lucy_blackbg.jpg
