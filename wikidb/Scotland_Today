1.00	Scotland_Today	Scotland Today	Scotland Today was a Scottish regional news programme covering Central Scotland, produced by STV Central (formerly Scottish Television). Despite its name suggesting a national remit, the programme was actually limited to stories around STV's Central Belt franchise. North Tonight covered STV's North Scotland region (from North Fife upwards), until both programmes were renamed as STV News at Six in March 2009.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/ScotlandToday.png/150px-ScotlandToday.png
