56.3	Germination	Germination	Germination is the process in which a plant or fungus emerges from a seed or spore, respectively, and begins growth. The most common example of germination is the sprouting of a seedling from a seed of an angiosperm or gymnosperm. However the growth of a sporeling from a spore, for example the growth of hyphae from fungal spores, is also germination. In a more general sense, germination can imply anything expanding into greater being from a small existence or germ.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Sunflower_seedlings.jpg/250px-Sunflower_seedlings.jpg
