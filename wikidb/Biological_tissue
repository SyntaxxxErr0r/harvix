61.8	Biological_tissue	Tissue (biology)	Tissue is a cellular organizational level intermediate between cells and a complete organism. A tissue is an ensemble of cells, not necessarily identical, but from the same origin, that together carry out a specific function. These are called tissues because of their identical functioning. Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Plant_cell_type_sclerenchyma_fibers.png/300px-Plant_cell_type_sclerenchyma_fibers.png
