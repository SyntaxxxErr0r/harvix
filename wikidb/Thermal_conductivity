58.8	Thermal_conductivity	Thermal conductivity	There are a number of ways to measure thermal conductivity. Each of these is suitable for a limited range of materials, depending on the thermal properties and the medium temperature. There is a distinction between steady-state and transient techniques.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Thermal_conductivity.svg/550px-Thermal_conductivity.svg.png
