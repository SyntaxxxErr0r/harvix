2.00	Heron-mark_sword	Heron-mark sword	In the world of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, heron-mark swords are traditionally presented to those who have earned the title of "Blademaster"- either by killing a Blademaster in a fair fight or by being granted the title by a unanimous vote of five Blademasters. These individuals are unrivaled in their mastery of the sword, and are accordingly rare.
