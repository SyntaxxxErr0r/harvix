1.00	Fokker_V.2	Fokker V.2	The Fokker V.2 and V.3 aircraft were developed from the Fokker V.1, but utilized an 89 kW (120 hp) Mercedes liquid-cooled inline engine instead of the rotary. This is similar to the Fokker V.6 being tested as the Fokker V.5 was being developed. Like the V.1, the fuselage was circular in cross section, and the wings were covered with plywood. To correct the center of lift and center of gravity for the heavier engines, these aircraft had their upper wing's outboard sections swept back.
