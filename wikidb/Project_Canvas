15.40	Project_Canvas	YouView	YouView, formerly known as Project Canvas, is a proposed open, internet-connected television platform in the United Kingdom. The venture is a partnership between four broadcasters and three communications companies (Arqiva, BT and TalkTalk). The platform will allow consumers access to a range of third-party services (television channels, radio stations, on-demand services and internet content) using a compliant device (such as a set-top box) built to a common technical standard and through a broadband internet connection. The project was branded YouView in September 2010. Although YouView was originally scheduled to launch by the end of 2010, its launch date has been continually revised and TalkTalk have stated that they will now be running an in-house trial at the beginning of April 2012. The set-top boxes are scheduled to be available to the public before the start of the London Olympics in July 2012.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/YouView_logo.png/200px-YouView_logo.png
