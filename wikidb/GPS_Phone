18.31	GPS_Phone	GPS navigation device	A GPS navigation device is any device that receives Global Positioning System (GPS) signals for the purpose of determining the device's current location on Earth. GPS devices provide latitude and longitude information, and some may also calculate altitude, although this is not considered sufficiently accurate or continuously available enough (due to the possibility of signal blockage and other factors) to rely on exclusively to pilot aircraft. GPS devices are used in military, aviation, marine and consumer product applications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Gosmore_in_berlin_with_winCE_on_transonic_6000.jpg/220px-Gosmore_in_berlin_with_winCE_on_transonic_6000.jpg
