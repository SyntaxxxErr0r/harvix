1.00	Souled_Out_(1998)	Souled Out	Souled Out was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) promoted by World Championship Wrestling in the month of January from 1997 through 2000. It was originally started as an nWo PPV but it did not generate the revenue it hoped for so it was turned into a WCW and nWo co-promoted PPV. This show, along with all of the other WCW pay-per-views that followed, stayed as a co-branded WCW/nWo show until the nWo disbanded in 1999. In 2001, it was replaced by WCW Sin. WWE have owned the rights to Souled Out since they purchased WCW in 2001.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/SOLDOUT.jpg/200px-SOLDOUT.jpg
