23.72	Whale_fall	Whale fall	A whale fall was first observed by marine biologists led by University of Hawaii oceanographer Craig Smith in 1987, discovered accidentally by the submersible Alvin using scanning sonar at 1,240 m (4,070 ft) in the Catalina Basin. Whale falls have since been found by other scientists, and by military submarines. They can be found by using side-scan sonar to examine the ocean floor for large aggregations of matter.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Whale_fall.jpg/250px-Whale_fall.jpg
