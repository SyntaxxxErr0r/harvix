2.10	Indianapolis_Hoosiers	St. Louis Maroons / Indianapolis Hoosiers	The St. Louis Maroons were a professional baseball club based in St. Louis, Missouri, from 1884-1886. The club, established by Henry Lucas, were the one near-major league quality entry in the Union Association, a league that lasted only one season, due in large part to the dominance of the Maroons. When the UA folded after playing just one season, the Maroons joined the National League. In 1887 the Maroons relocated to Indianapolis and became the Indianapolis Hoosiers, playing three more seasons before folding.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/1888_Indianapolis_Hoosiers.jpg/300px-1888_Indianapolis_Hoosiers.jpg
