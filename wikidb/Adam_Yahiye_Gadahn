93.8	Adam_Yahiye_Gadahn	Adam Yahiye Gadahn	Adam Yahiye Gadahn (Arabic: ‎, Ādam Yaḥyā Ghadan; born Adam Pearlman, September 1, 1978) is an American who is a senior operative, cultural interpreter, spokesman and media advisor for the islamist group Al-Qaeda. Since 2004, he appeared in a number of videos produced by Al-Qaeda as "Azzam the American" ('Azzām al-Amrīki, عزام الأمريكي, sometimes transcribed as Ezzam Al-Amerikee). Gadahn converted to Islam in 1995, at the age of 17, at a California mosque and is described as a "homegrown", meaning that he has converted to an ideology so firmly that he is now willing to harm his country of origin. He is believed to have inspired the 2007 Osama bin Laden video.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Gadahn.PNG
