116.2	Shinto	Shinto	Shinto Shint≈ç) or Shintoism, also kami-no-michi, is the indigenous spirituality of Japan and the people of Japan. It is a set of practices, to be carried out diligently, to establish a connection between present day Japan and its ancient past. Shinto practices were first recorded and codified in the written historical records of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki in the 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified "Shinto religion", but rather to disorganized folklore, history, and mythology. Shinto today is a term that applies to public shrines suited to various purposes such as war memorials, harvest festivals, romance, and historical monuments, as well as various sectarian organizations. Practitioners express their diverse beliefs through a standard language and practice, adopting a similar style in dress and ritual, dating from around the time of the Nara and Heian Periods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Takachiho-gawara_Kirishima_City_Kagoshima_Pref02n4050.jpg/220px-Takachiho-gawara_Kirishima_City_Kagoshima_Pref02n4050.jpg
