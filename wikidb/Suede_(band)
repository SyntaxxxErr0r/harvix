51.4	Suede_(band)	Suede (band)	Suede are an English alternative rock band from London, formed in 1989. The group's most prominent early line-up featured singer Brett Anderson, guitarist Bernard Butler, bass player Mat Osman and drummer Simon Gilbert. By 1992, Suede were hailed as "The Best New Band in Britain", and attracted much attention from the British music press. The following year their glam rock-inspired debut album, Suede, went to the top of the charts, became the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years and won the Mercury Music Prize, helping kick-start the Britpop movement. However, the band's lush follow-up, Dog Man Star (1994), saw Suede distance themselves from their Britpop peers. Although it is often regarded as the band's masterpiece, the recording sessions for Dog Man Star were fraught with difficulty, and ended with Butler departing the band after heated arguments with Anderson.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Suede%2C_royal_albert_hall_2010.jpg/267px-Suede%2C_royal_albert_hall_2010.jpg
