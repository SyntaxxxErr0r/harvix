1.00	Post_route	Post (route)	A post is a moderate to deep passing route in American football in which a receiver runs 10-20 yards from the line of scrimmage straight down the field, then cuts toward the middle of the field (towards the facing goalposts, hence the name) at a 45-degree angle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Post_route.png/275px-Post_route.png
