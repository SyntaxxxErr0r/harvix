65.1	Subset	Subset	In mathematics, especially in set theory, a set A is a subset of a set B, or equivalently B is a superset of A, if A is "contained" inside B. A and B may coincide. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Venn_A_subset_B.svg/150px-Venn_A_subset_B.svg.png
