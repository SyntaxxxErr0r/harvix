Improvisers typically use audience suggestions to contribute to the content and direction of the performance as they create dialogue, setting, and plot extemporaneously. It is typically comedic, though sometimes poignant or dramatic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Improv_austin_2009.jpg/220px-Improv_austin_2009.jpg
