6.40	West_Quoddy_Head_Light	West Quoddy Head Light	West Quoddy Head in Lubec, Maine is the easternmost point of the contiguous United States and the closest point to Europe from a point in the fifty States. West Quoddy Head overlooks Quoddy Narrows, a strait between Canada and the United States. Since 1808, there has been a lighthouse there to guide ships through the waterway. The current one, with distinctive red-and-white stripes, was built in 1858. Photographs and paintings of this lighthouse are frequently reproduced. The 3rd order Fresnel lens is the only 3rd order and one of only eight Fresnel lenses still in use on the Maine Coast.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/West_Quoddy_Head_Light.jpg/220px-West_Quoddy_Head_Light.jpg
