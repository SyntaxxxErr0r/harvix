1.00	Bent_molecular_geometry	Bent molecular geometry	In chemistry, the term "bent" can be applied to certain molecules to describe their molecular geometry. H2O is an example of a bent molecule. The bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms is approximately 104.45Â°. Nonlinear triatomic molecules and ions are common for compounds containing only main group elements, prominent examples being nitrogen dioxide, SCl2, and the CH2. This geometry is almost always consistent with VSEPR theory.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Bent-3D-balls.png/200px-Bent-3D-balls.png
