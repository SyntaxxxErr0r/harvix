93.8	Metroid	Metroid	Metroid Metoroido) is a series of science fiction action-adventure video games by Nintendo. It chronicles the missions of bounty hunter Samus Aran who protects the galaxy from the depredations of the Space Pirates and their attempts to harness the power of the eponymous Metroids. It is noted for having one of the first female protagonists in a video game and for its nonlinear gameplay. Metroid combines the platforming of Super Mario Bros. and the exploration aspect of The Legend of Zelda with a decidedly darker atmosphere.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/Metroidlogo.png
