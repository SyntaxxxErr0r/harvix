62.7	Kademlia	Kademlia	Consider the simple network to the right. The network size is 2^3 or eight maximum keys and nodes. There are seven nodes participating; the small circles at the bottom. The node under consideration is node six (binary 110) in black. There are three k-buckets for each node in this network. Nodes zero, one and two (binary 000, 001, and 010) are candidates for the farthest k-bucket . Node three (binary 011) is not participating in the network. In the middle k-bucket, nodes four and five (binary 100 and 101) are placed. Finally, the third k-bucket can only contain node seven (binary 111). Each of the three k-buckets is enclosed in a gray circle. If the size of the k-bucket was two, then the farthest 2-bucket can only contain two of the three nodes. For example if node six has node one and two in the farthest 2-bucket, it would have to request a node ID lookup to these nodes to find the location (ip address) of node zero. Each node knows its neighbourhood well and has contact with a few nodes far away which can help locate other nodes far away.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Dht_example.png
