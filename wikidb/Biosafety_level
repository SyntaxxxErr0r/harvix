66.7	Biosafety_level	Biosafety level	Biocontainment can be classified by the relative danger to the surrounding environment as biological safety levels (BSL). As of 2006 , there are four safety levels. These are called BSL1 through BSL4, with one anomalous level BSL3-ag for agricultural hazards between BSL3 and BSL4. Facilities with these designations are also sometimes given as P1 through P4 (for Pathogen or Protection level), as in the term P3 laboratory. Higher numbers indicate a greater risk to the external environment. See biological hazard.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Positive-pressure_biosafety_suit.jpg/220px-Positive-pressure_biosafety_suit.jpg
