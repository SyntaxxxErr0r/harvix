62.5	The_Coasters	The Coasters	The Coasters are an American rhythm and blues/rock and roll vocal group that had a string of hits in the late 1950s. Beginning with "Searchin'" and "Young Blood," their most memorable songs were written by the songwriting and producing team of Leiber and Stoller. Although the Coasters originated outside of mainstream doo wop, their records were so frequently imitated that they became an important part of the doo wop legacy through the 1960s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Coasters_promo.jpg/220px-Coasters_promo.jpg
