2.00	Balance_shafts	Balance shaft	In piston engine engineering, a balance shaft is an eccentric weighted shaft which offsets vibrations in engine designs that are not inherently balanced (for example, most four-cylinder engines). They were first invented and patented by British engineer Frederick Lanchester in 1904.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Balanceshaft.jpg/250px-Balanceshaft.jpg
