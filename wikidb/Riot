54.9	Riot	Riot	A riot is a form of civil disorder characterized often by what is thought of as disorganized groups lashing out in a sudden and intense rash of violence against authority, property or people. While individuals may attempt to lead or control a riot, riots are thought to be typically chaotic and exhibit herd behaviour, and usually generated by civil unrest. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that riots are not irrational, herd-like behaviour, but follow inverted social norms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Battle_strike_1934.jpg/220px-Battle_strike_1934.jpg
