7.32	Ancient_tea_route	Ancient tea route	The Ancient Tea Route (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ) was a network of mule caravan paths winding through the mountains of Yunnan Province in Southwest China. It is also referred to as the Southern Silk Road and Tea and Horse Road. From around a thousand years ago, the Ancient Tea Route was a trade link from Yunnan, one of the first tea-producing regions: to India via Burma; to Tibet; and to central China via Sichuan Province. In addition to tea, the mule caravans carried salt. Both people and horses carried heavy loads, the tea porters sometimes carrying over 60-90kg, which was often more than their own body weight in tea.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Transasia_trade_routes_1stC_CE_gr2.png/400px-Transasia_trade_routes_1stC_CE_gr2.png
