79.6	Heirloom_plant	Heirloom plant	An heirloom plant, heirloom variety, heritage fruit (Australia), or (especially in the UK) heirloom vegetable is a cultivar that was commonly grown during earlier periods in human history, but which is not used in modern large-scale agriculture. Many heirloom vegetables have kept their traits through open pollination, while fruit varieties such as apples have been propagated over the centuries through grafts and cuttings. The trend of growing heirloom plants in gardens has been growing in popularity in North America and Europe over the last decade.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Patates.jpg/220px-Patates.jpg
