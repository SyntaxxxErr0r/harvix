113.4	Albus_Dumbledore	Albus Dumbledore	Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is a major character of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. For most of the series, he is the headmaster of the wizarding school Hogwarts. As part of his back-story, it is revealed that he is the founder and leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting the main antagonist of the series, Lord Voldemort. Rowling stated she chose the name Dumbledore, which is an Early Modern English word for "bumblebee", because of Dumbledore's love of music: she imagined him walking around "humming to himself a lot".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fe/Dumbledore_and_Elder_Wand.JPG/300px-Dumbledore_and_Elder_Wand.JPG
