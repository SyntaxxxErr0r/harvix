It was widely used by the U.S. and its Cold War allies, especially those in NATO, and remains in service throughout the world today despite being superseded by the M1 Abrams in the U.S. military. Egypt is currently the largest operator with 1,700 upgraded M60A3s, Turkey is second with more than 900 upgraded units in service, and Israel is third with over 700 units of Israeli variants.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/AmericanTank.jpg/300px-AmericanTank.jpg
