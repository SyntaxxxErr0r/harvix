83.3	Selective_breeding	Selective breeding	Selective breeding is the process of breeding plants and animals for particular traits. Typically, strains that are selectively bred are domesticated, and the breeding is sometimes done by a professional breeder. Bred animals are known as breeds, while bred plants are known as varieties, cultigens, or cultivars. The cross of animals results in what is called a crossbreed, and crossbred plants are called hybrids. The term selective breeding is synonymous with artificial selection.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Sectio_caesarea.jpg/220px-Sectio_caesarea.jpg
