There are no universally accepted definitions of either race or intelligence in academia, and any discussion of their connection involves studies from multiple disciplines, including psychology, anthropology, biology, and sociology.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Alfred_Binet.jpg/160px-Alfred_Binet.jpg
