1.00	X-linked_gene	Sex linkage	Sex linkage is the phenotypic expression of an allele related to the chromosomal sex of the individual. This mode of inheritance is in contrast to the inheritance of traits on autosomal chromosomes, where both sexes have the same probability of inheritance. Since humans have many more genes on the X than the Y, there are many more X-linked traits than Y-linked traits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Sex-linked_inheritance.svg/350px-Sex-linked_inheritance.svg.png
