56.1	Post_scarcity	Post-scarcity economy	Post scarcity (also styled post-scarcity or postscarcity) is a form of economy or society, in which things such as goods, services and information are free, or practically free. This would be due to an abundance of fundamental resources (matter, energy and intelligence), in conjunction with sophisticated automated systems capable of converting raw materials into finished goods, allowing manufacturing to be as easy as duplicating software.
