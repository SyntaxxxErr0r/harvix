2.01	Thomas_Sterling_(computing)	Thomas Sterling (computing)	Dr. Thomas Sterling is currently a Professor of Computer Science at Louisiana State University, a Faculty Associate at California Institute of Technology, and a Distinguished Visiting Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He received his PhD as a Hertz Fellow from MIT in 1984. He is probably best known as the father of Beowulf clusters (developed in collaboration with Don Becker) and for his research on Petaflops computing architecture. Professor Sterling is the co-author of six books and holds six patents. He was awarded the Gordon Bell Prize with collaborators in 1997. Currently, Dr. Sterling is working on a computational model called ParalleX, an advanced message-driven split-transaction computing model for scalable low-power fault-tolerant operation. In addition, he is developing an ultra lightweight supervisor runtime kernel in support of MIND and other fine grain architectures (like CELL) and the Agincourt parallel programming language for high efficiency through intrinsics in support of latency hiding and low overhead synchronization for both conventional and innovative parallel computer architectures.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Thomas_Sterling.jpg/220px-Thomas_Sterling.jpg
