59.3	IEEE_754-1985	IEEE 754-1985	IEEE 754-1985 was an industry standard for representing floating-point numbers in computers, officially adopted in 1985 and superseded in 2008 by IEEE 754-2008. During its 23 years, it was the most widely used format for floating-point computation. It was implemented in software, in the form of floating-point libraries, and in hardware, in the instructions of many CPUs and FPUs. The first integrated circuit to implement the draft of what was to become IEEE 754-1985 was the Intel 8087.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/IEEE_754_Single_Floating_Point_Format.svg/618px-IEEE_754_Single_Floating_Point_Format.svg.png
