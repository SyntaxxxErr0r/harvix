Since then he has released his fifth album För sent för Edelweiss (Too Late for Edelweiss). His sixth and most recent album is the critically acclaimed 2 steg från Paradise, released on October 13, 2010.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Cb_h%C3%A5kan_2.JPG/220px-Cb_h%C3%A5kan_2.JPG
