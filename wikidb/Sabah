56.4	Sabah	Sabah	Sabah is one of 13 member states of Malaysia,, and its easternmost state. It is located on the northern portion of the island of Borneo. It is the second largest state in the country after Sarawak, which it borders on its southwest. It also shares a border with the province of East Kalimantan of Indonesia in the south. In spite of its status as a Malaysian state, Sabah remains a disputed territory; the Philippines has a dormant claim over much of the eastern part of the territory. The capital of Sabah is Kota Kinabalu, formerly known as Jesselton. Sabah is often referred to as "Land Below The Wind", because of its location just south of the typhoon-prone region around the Philippines.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Flag_of_Sabah.svg/100px-Flag_of_Sabah.svg.png
