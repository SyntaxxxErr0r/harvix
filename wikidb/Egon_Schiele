122.0	Egon_Schiele	Egon Schiele	Egon Schiele (German pronunciation: , approximately SHEE-leh; June 12, 1890 – October 31, 1918) was an Austrian painter. A protégé of Gustav Klimt, Schiele was a major figurative painter of the early 20th century. His work is noted for its intensity, and the many self-portraits the artist produced. The twisted body shapes and the expressive line that characterize Schiele's paintings and drawings mark the artist as an early exponent of Expressionism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Egon_Schiele_075.jpg/200px-Egon_Schiele_075.jpg
