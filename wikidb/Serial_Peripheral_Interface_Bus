64.1	Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus	Serial Peripheral Interface Bus	The Serial Peripheral Interface Bus or SPI bus is a synchronous serial data link standard, named by Motorola, that operates in full duplex mode. Devices communicate in master/slave mode where the master device initiates the data frame. Multiple slave devices are allowed with individual slave select lines. Sometimes SPI is called a 4-wire serial bus, contrasting with 3-, two-, and 1-wire serial buses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/SPI_single_slave.svg/350px-SPI_single_slave.svg.png
