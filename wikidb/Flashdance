55.4	Flashdance	Flashdance	Flashdance is a 1983 American romantic drama film that was the first collaboration of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. Its presentation of some sequences in the style of music videos was an influence on other 1980s films including Top Gun (1986), Simpson and Bruckheimer's most famous production. Flashdance opened to negative reviews by professional critics, but was a surprise box office success, becoming the third highest grossing film of 1983 in the USA. It had a worldwide box-office gross of more than $100 million. Its soundtrack spawned several hit songs, among them "Maniac" performed by Michael Sembello and the Academy Award-winning "Flashdance... What a Feeling", performed by Irene Cara, which was written for the film.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/Flashdanceposter.jpg/215px-Flashdanceposter.jpg
