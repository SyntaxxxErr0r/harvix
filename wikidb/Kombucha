Kombucha is available commercially and can be made at home by fermenting tea using a visible, solid mass of yeast and bacteria which forms the kombucha culture, often referred to as 酵母 (kombo, lit. "yeast mother", see etymology for disambiguation with 昆布, kombu, kelp).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Kombucha_Mature.jpg/225px-Kombucha_Mature.jpg
