135.1	Impressionism	Impressionism	Impressionism was a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s in spite of harsh opposition from the art community in France. The name of the style is derived from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant , which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satiric review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Claude_Monet%2C_Impression%2C_soleil_levant%2C_1872.jpg/220px-Claude_Monet%2C_Impression%2C_soleil_levant%2C_1872.jpg
