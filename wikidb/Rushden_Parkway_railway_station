2.00	Rushden_Parkway_railway_station	Rushden Parkway railway station	Rushden Parkway railway station is a proposed new railway station to serve the towns of Rushden and Higham Ferrers and the large village of Irchester in Northamptonshire. The two towns and village have not seen passenger rail services since 1959. The former station building at Rushden has been preserved and now houses Rushden Station Railway Museum. Rushden Parkway would be built on the Midland Main Line (which runs to the west of Rushden) on the site of the former Irchester railway station. In June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) commissioned a new report, advocated a park and ride station for Rushden , although the report inadvertently stated that it would be sited in Irthlingborough and not Irchester.
