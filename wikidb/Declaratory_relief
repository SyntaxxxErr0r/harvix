6.11	Declaratory_relief	Declaratory relief	Declaratory relief is a judge's determination (called a "declaratory judgment") of the parties' rights under a contract or a statute, often requested (and highly desired) in a lawsuit over a contract. In theory, an early resolution of legal rights will resolve some or all of the other issues in the matter.
