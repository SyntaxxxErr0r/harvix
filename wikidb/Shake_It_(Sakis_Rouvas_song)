3.10	Shake_It_(Sakis_Rouvas_song)	Shake It (Sakis Rouvas song)	"Shake It" is an English language song by Greek singer Sakis Rouvas and was the Greek entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004. The song is an up-tempo number, with Rouvas telling his lover that "I would trade my life for a night with you" and asking the lover to "shake it" for him. The music - by Nikos Terzis - also features some traditional Greek instrumentation as well as the heavy dance beats increasingly prominent at the Contest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/RouvasShakeItEuro.jpg/220px-RouvasShakeItEuro.jpg
