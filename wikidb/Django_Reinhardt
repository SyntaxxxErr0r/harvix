132.8	Django_Reinhardt	Django Reinhardt	Django Reinhardt (French pronunciation: ; 23 January 1910 – 16 May 1953) was a pioneering virtuoso jazz guitarist and composer. Within the history of jazz he is regarded as the first important innovator of European provenance who made a major contribution to the development of the idiom. He is also revered by guitarists worldwide as among the foremost exponents of the instrument. Reinhardt invented an entirely new style of jazz guitar technique (sometimes called 'hot' jazz guitar) that has since become a living musical tradition within French gypsy culture. With violinist Stéphane Grappelli, he co-founded the Quintette du Hot Club de France, described by critic Thom Jurek as "one of the most original bands in the history of recorded jazz." Reinhardt's most popular compositions have become jazz standards, including "Minor Swing", "Daphne", "Belleville", "Djangology", "Swing '42", and "Nuages".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Django_Reinhardt_%28Gottlieb_07301%29.jpg/220px-Django_Reinhardt_%28Gottlieb_07301%29.jpg
