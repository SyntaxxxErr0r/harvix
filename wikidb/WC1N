1.00	WC1N	WC postcode area	The WC (Western Central) postcode area, also known as the London WC postcode area, is a group of postcode districts in central London, England. It includes parts of the London Borough of Camden, City of Westminster, London Borough of Islington and a very small part of the City of London. The area covered is of very-high density development. The current postcode districts are relatively recent: divisions WC1 and WC2 districts established only in 1917. Where the districts are used for purposes other than the sorting of mail, such as use as a geographic reference and on street signs, they continue to be commonly grouped into these two 'districts'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/United_Kingdom_location_map.svg/250px-United_Kingdom_location_map.svg.png
