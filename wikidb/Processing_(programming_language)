73.1	Processing_(programming_language)	Processing (programming language)	Processing is an open source programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the basics of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks. The project was initiated in 2001 by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry, both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab. One of the stated aims of Processing is to act as a tool to get non-programmers started with programming, through the instant gratification of visual feedback. The language builds on the Java programming language, but uses a simplified syntax and graphics programming model.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Processing_Logo_Clipped.svg/180px-Processing_Logo_Clipped.svg.png
