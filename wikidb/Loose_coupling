73.2	Loose_coupling	Loose coupling	In computing and systems design a loosely coupled system is one where each of its components has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components. The notion was introduced into organizational studies by Karl Weick. Sub-areas include the coupling of classes, interfaces, data, and services.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Loose_Coupling_Example.JPG
