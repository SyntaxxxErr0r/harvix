1.00	%E2%8C%A4	Enter key	In computer keyboards, the enter key (or the return key on Macs and most Sun Workstations) in most cases causes a command line, window form, or dialog box to operate its default function. This is typically to finish an "entry" and begin the desired process, and is usually an alternative to pressing an OK button.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Enter.png/220px-Enter.png
