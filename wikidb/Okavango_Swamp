2.00	Okavango_Swamp	Okavango Delta	The Okavango Delta (or Okavango Swamp), in Botswana, is the world's largest inland delta. It is formed where the Okavango River empties onto a swamp in an endorheic basin in the Kalahari Desert, where most of the water is lost to evaporation and transpiration instead of draining into the sea. Each year approximately 11 cubic kilometres of water irrigate the 15,000 kmÂ² area. Some flood-waters drain into Lake Ngami. The Moremi Game Reserve, a National Park, spreads across the eastern side of the delta.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Okavango_Delta_map.png/220px-Okavango_Delta_map.png
