60.4	Lost_Decade_(Japan)	Lost Decade (Japan)	The Lost Decade Ushinawareta Jūnen) is the time after the Japanese asset price bubble's collapse within the Japanese economy, which occurred gradually rather than catastrophically. The term originally referred to the years 1991 to 2000, but recently the decade from 2001 to 2010 is also sometimes included, so that the whole period of the 1990s and 2000s is referred to as the Lost Decades or the Lost Years (失われた20年, Ushinawareta Nijūnen).
