Comyns Carr and Charles Hall√©. The gallery proved crucial to the Aesthetic Movement because it provided a home for those artists whose approaches the more classical and conservative Royal Academy did not welcome, such as Edward Burne-Jones and Walter Crane.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/ComynscarrVF.jpg/250px-ComynscarrVF.jpg
