1.01	History_of_Netherlands	History of the Netherlands	The history of the Netherlands is the history of a seafaring people thriving on a watery lowland river delta flowing into the North Sea at the edge of northwestern Europe. When the Romans and written history arrived in 57 BC, the country was sparsely populated by various tribal groups at the periphery of the empire. Over four centuries of Roman rule had profound demographic effects, resulting eventually in the establishment of three primary Germanic peoples in the area: Frisians, Low Saxons and the Franks. Hiberno-Scottish and Anglo-Saxon missionaries led them to adopt Christianity by the 8th century. The descendants of the Salian Franks eventually came to dominate the area, and from their speech the Dutch language arose.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands_-_02.svg/150px-Coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands_-_02.svg.png
