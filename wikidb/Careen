1.20	Careen	Careening	Careening a sailing vessel is the practice of beaching it at high tide. This is usually done in order to expose one side or another of the ship's hull for maintenance and repairs below the water line when the tide goes out. This practice is also known as to "hove down".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/An_Old_Whaler_Hove_Down_For_Repairs%2C_Near_New_Bedford.jpg/220px-An_Old_Whaler_Hove_Down_For_Repairs%2C_Near_New_Bedford.jpg
