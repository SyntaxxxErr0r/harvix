1.10	Butt_report	Butt Report	The truth about the failure of Bomber Command shook everyone. Senior RAF commanders argued that the Butt's statistics were faulty and commissioned another report. This report was delivered by the Directorate of Bombing Operations on 22 September 1941 and, extrapolating from an analysis of the bomb damage inflicted on British cities, calculated that the RAF could destroy the forty-three German towns with a population of more than 100,000 with a force of 4,000 bombers. The Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Charles Portal, argued that with such a force RAF Bomber Command could win the war in six months. Not all were convinced and when Churchill expressed his doubts, the Air Staff retrenched and said that even if it did not knock Germany out of the war, it would weaken them sufficiently to allow British armed forces back in to Europe. With this compromise between the armed services, Bomber Command was allowed to keep its planned allocation of materiel. This did not stop those outside the Chiefs of Staff questioning the strategic bombing policy.
