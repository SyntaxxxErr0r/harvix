266.8	Lean_manufacturing	Lean manufacturing	Most of the basic goals of lean manufacturing are common sense, and documented examples can be seen as early as Benjamin Franklin. Poor Richard's Almanac says of wasted time, "He that idly loses 5s. worth of time, loses 5s., and might as prudently throw 5s. into the river." He added that avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales: "A penny saved is two pence clear. A pin a-day is a groat a-year. Save and have."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Benjamin-Franklin-U.S.-%24100-bill.jpg/220px-Benjamin-Franklin-U.S.-%24100-bill.jpg
