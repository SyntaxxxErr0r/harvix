Common additions include vegetables, herbs, spices, and either wine or cognac, armagnac or brandy. Pâté can be served either hot or cold, but it is considered to develop its fullest flavor after a few days of chilling.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Pates_p1150435.jpg/250px-Pates_p1150435.jpg
