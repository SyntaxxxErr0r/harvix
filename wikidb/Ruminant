84.8	Ruminant	Ruminant	A ruminant is a mammal of the order Artiodactyla that digests plant-based food by initially softening it within the animal's first compartment of the stomach, principally through bacterial actions, then regurgitating the semi-digested mass, now known as cud, and chewing it again. The process of rechewing the cud to further break down plant matter and stimulate digestion is called "ruminating".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Abomasum_%28PSF%29.png/250px-Abomasum_%28PSF%29.png
