3.00	Le_Classique	Le Classique	Le Classique (French pronunciation: , The Classic), also known as Derby de France, is a football match contested between French top-flight clubs Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique de Marseille. The term "Le Classique" is modeled on the El Clásico, contested between Real Madrid and Barcelona. These meetings became important during the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. Canal + and Bernard Tapie started to promote near the general public confrontations between the two clubs, making these matches of interest for all French football fans. The tension between OM and PSG fans is legendary, and both clubs' world-class stadia, the Stade Vélodrome and the Parc des Princes, respectively, are renowned for the white-hot atmosphere and fervent fans. More and more, the various groups of Marseille and Parisian supporters have hated and battled each other. Important security measures are taken to prevent confrontations between the fans, but violent episodes still often occur every time the duo meet.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Om-psg-2006-scarf.JPG/250px-Om-psg-2006-scarf.JPG
