4.00	Saponify	Saponification	Saponification is a process that produces soap, usually from fats and lye. In technical terms, saponification involves base (usually caustic soda NaOH) hydrolysis of triglycerides, which are esters of fatty acids, to form the sodium salt of a carboxylate. In addition to soap, such traditional saponification processes produces glycerol. "Saponifiable substances" are those that can be converted into soap.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/SaponificationGeneral.svg/450px-SaponificationGeneral.svg.png
