1.01	Animal_Tracks_(U.S._album)	Animal Tracks (American album)	Animal Tracks was The Animals' third album in the United States. Musically, it was a hodge-podge of the group's recent hit singles mixed in with tracks of assorted vintage that had not been included on either of The Animals' first two U.S. albums. As such it bore little resemblance in content or purpose to the band's British release also named Animal Tracks from four months earlier.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/AnimalTracksUSCover.jpg
