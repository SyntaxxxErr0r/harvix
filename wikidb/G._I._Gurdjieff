55.4	G._I._Gurdjieff	George Gurdjieff	George Ivanovich Gurdjieff (Armenian: , (Georgian: , Greek: , Russian: , January 13, 1877? â€“ October 29, 1949) was an influential spiritual teacher of the early to middle 20th century who taught that the vast majority of humanity live their entire lives in a state of hypnotic "waking sleep", but that it was possible to transcend to a higher state of consciousness and achieve full human potential. Gurdjieff developed a method for doing so, calling his discipline "The Work" (connoting "work on oneself") according to his principles and instructions,. Gurdjieff's method for awakening one's consciousness is different from that of the fakir, monk or yogi, so his discipline is also called (originally) the "Fourth Way". At one point he described his teaching as being "esoteric Christianity".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Georges_Gurdjieff.JPG/220px-Georges_Gurdjieff.JPG
