2.10	AG36	Heckler &amp; Koch AG36	The AG36 is a single-shot 40 mm grenade launcher which operates on the High-Low System and was designed primarily for installation on the G36 assault rifle, designed by the German weapons manufacturing company Heckler &amp; Koch of Oberndorf am Neckar. It originally appeared as Heckler &amp; Koch's candidate for the US Army's Enhanced Grenade Launcher requirement, evaluated for use with the XM8 and FN SCAR rifles. As is commonly mistaken, the "A" is not an addition to the name "G36" which is short for Gewehr 36 but is in fact an abbreviation of the German Anbaugranatwerfer, literally meaning "attached grenade launcher" and the 36 coming from the name of the primary weapon it was designed to enhance â€“ the G36. It can also be used dismounted, with a stock attached as a stand alone model, or a LLM01 laser light module can be attached to it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/GewehrAG36.jpg/300px-GewehrAG36.jpg
