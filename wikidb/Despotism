55.1	Despotism	Despotism	Despotism is a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power. That entity may be an individual, as in an autocracy, or it may be a group, as in an oligarchy. The word despotism means to "rule in the fashion of a despot" and does not necessarily require a singular "despot", an individual.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Court_of_Loango.png/220px-Court_of_Loango.png
