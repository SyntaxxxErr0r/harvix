85.1	Mormon	Mormons	Mormons are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism, a religious movement beginning with the visions of Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s. After Smith's death in 1844 the Mormons followed Brigham Young to what would become the Utah Territory. Today a vast majority of Mormons are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) while a minority are members of other churches. Many Mormons are also either independent or non-practicing. The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah, and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, though the majority of Mormons live outside the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Joseph_Smith_first_vision_stained_glass.jpg/170px-Joseph_Smith_first_vision_stained_glass.jpg
