372.6	OSI_model	OSI model	The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection effort at the International Organization for Standardization. It is a prescription of characterizing and standardizing the functions of a communications system in terms of abstraction layers. Similar communication functions are grouped into logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/OSI-model-Communication.svg/400px-OSI-model-Communication.svg.png
