89.5	Mitosis	Mitosis	Mitosis is the process by which a eukaryotic cell separates the chromosomes in its cell nucleus into two identical sets, in two separate nuclei. It is generally followed immediately by cytokinesis, which divides the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of the cell cycleâ€”the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell. This accounts for approximately 10% of the cell cycle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Major_events_in_mitosis.svg/350px-Major_events_in_mitosis.svg.png
