81.1	Law_of_large_numbers	Law of large numbers	In probability theory, the law of large numbers is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Largenumbers.svg/400px-Largenumbers.svg.png
