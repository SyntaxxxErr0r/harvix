2.00	Hiking_trail	Trail	A trail (also track, byway) is a path with a rough beaten or dirt/stone surface used for travel. Trails may be for use only by walkers and in some places are the main access route to remote settlements. Some trails can also be used for hiking, cycling, or cross-country skiing and less often for moving cattle herds and other livestock.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/WhitewaterStateParkTrail2010.jpg/220px-WhitewaterStateParkTrail2010.jpg
