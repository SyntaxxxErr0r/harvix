69.4	Heavy_water	Heavy water	Heavy water is water highly enriched in the hydrogen isotope deuterium; e.g., heavy water used in CANDU reactors is 99.75% enriched by hydrogen atom-fraction (in ordinary water, the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio is about 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms). The term "heavy water" today is somewhat colloquial, and pure heavy water for research and commercial use is generally commercially offered, and referred to, as deuterium oxide. It is not radioactive. It is about 11% denser than water, but otherwise, is physically and chemically similar. However, the difference (especially the biological properties) is larger than in most other isotope-substituted compounds because deuterium is unique among heavy stable isotopes in being twice as heavy as the lightest isotope. This difference increases the strength of water's hydrogen-oxygen bond, and this in turn is enough to cause differences that are important to some biochemical reactions. The human body naturally contains deuterium equivalent to five grams of heavy water, which is harmless. When a large fraction of water (&gt; 50%) in higher organisms is replaced by heavy water, however, the result is cell dysfunction and death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Water_molecule_3D.svg/121px-Water_molecule_3D.svg.png
