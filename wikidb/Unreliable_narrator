51.6	Unreliable_narrator	Unreliable narrator	An unreliable narrator is a narrator, whether in literature, film, or theatre, whose credibility has been seriously compromised. The term was coined in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth in The Rhetoric of Fiction. This narrative mode is one that can be developed by an author for a number of reasons, usually to deceive the reader or audience. Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators, but third-person narrators can also be unreliable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Paul_Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_%281832-1883%29_-_Baron_von_M%C3%BCnchhausen_%281862%29_-_009.jpg/220px-Paul_Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_%281832-1883%29_-_Baron_von_M%C3%BCnchhausen_%281862%29_-_009.jpg
