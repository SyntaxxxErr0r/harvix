Nixon agreed to work with Young in forming the proposed combination, and granted him an option on his own plant. They then obtained options to purchase other shipbuilding companies. Working with a cotton industry bank known as the Trust Company of the Republic, they sought out underwriters, and planned to issue stock and sell bonds, in order to provide the funds to buy the plants and then operate them at a profit.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Lewis_Nixon.jpg/220px-Lewis_Nixon.jpg
