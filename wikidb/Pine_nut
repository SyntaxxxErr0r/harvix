51.0	Pine_nut	Pine nut	Pine nuts are the edible seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus Pinus). About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of great value as a human food.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Pinoli.jpg/220px-Pinoli.jpg
