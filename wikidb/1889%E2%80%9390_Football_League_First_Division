The clubs competing were the 12 original clubs which were the founders of the league the previous year. Unlike the modern system, two points were awarded for a win, with one for a draw and no points for a loss, this system was carried on right until the 1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/England_location_map.svg/369px-England_location_map.svg.png
