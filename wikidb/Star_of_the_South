2.00	Star_of_the_South	Star of the South	The Star of the South, also known as Estrela do Sul, is a diamond found in Brazil in 1853. The diamond is cut into a cushion shape and weighs 128.48 carats (25.70 g). The Star of the South is graded as a type IIa diamond, with a colour grading of fancy light pinkish-brown and a clarity of VS2. At the time of discovery, the diamond weighed 254.5 carats (50.9 g). It has passed through the hands of many owners, including the Maharaja of princely Baroda State, and its last known purchase was by Cartier, the French luxury jeweller around 2002, when it was sold by Rustomjee Jamsetjee of Mumbai. The light reflected by the diamond is white, and the refracted light is of a rose tint. This gives the diamond its light pinkish-brown hue.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Star_of_the_South_copy.jpg/220px-Star_of_the_South_copy.jpg
