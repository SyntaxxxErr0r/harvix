A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public art galleries, and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a de facto art gallery, providing space for art installations, performances (music, film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Grand_Palais_octobre_2005.jpg/200px-Grand_Palais_octobre_2005.jpg
