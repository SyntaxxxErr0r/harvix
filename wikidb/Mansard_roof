35.03	Mansard_roof	Mansard roof	A mansard or mansard roof (also called a French roof) is a four-sided gambrel-style hip roof characterized by two slopes on each of its sides with the lower slope, punctured by dormer windows, at a steeper angle than the upper. The roof creates an additional floor of habitable space, such as a garret. The upper slope of the roof may not be visible from street level when viewed from close proximity to the building.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Dampierre_en_Yvelines_Chateau_02.jpg/350px-Dampierre_en_Yvelines_Chateau_02.jpg
