1.00	Single-sourced	Single source publishing	Single source publishing, also known as single sourcing, allows the same content to be used in different documents (deliverables) or in various formats. The labour-intensive and expensive work of editing need only be carried out once, on one document. Further transformations are carried out mechanistically, by automated tools. You may also add new output formats in the future, as your organization's needs change.
