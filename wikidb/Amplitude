52.1	Amplitude	Amplitude	Amplitude is the magnitude of change in the oscillating variable with each oscillation within an oscillating system. For example, sound waves in air are oscillations in atmospheric pressure and their amplitudes are proportional to the change in pressure during one oscillation. If a variable undergoes regular oscillations, and a graph of the system is drawn with the oscillating variable as the vertical axis and time as the horizontal axis, the amplitude is visually represented by the vertical distance between the extrema of the curve and the equilibrium value.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Sine_voltage.svg/220px-Sine_voltage.svg.png
