2.00	G%C3%B6kturks	Göktürks	The Göktürks became the new leading element amongst the disparate steppe peoples in Central Asia, after they rebelled against the Rouran Khaganate. Under their leadership, the Turkic Khaganate rapidly expanded to rule huge territories in Central Asia. From 552 to 745, Göktürk leadership bound together the nomadic Turkic tribes into an empire, which eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/G%C3%B6kturksAD551-572.png/250px-G%C3%B6kturksAD551-572.png
