108.0	Punctuated_equilibrium	Punctuated equilibrium	Punctuated equilibrium (also called punctuated equilibria) is a theory in evolutionary biology which proposes that most species will exhibit little net evolutionary change for most of their geological history, remaining in an extended state called stasis. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Punctuated-equilibrium.svg/300px-Punctuated-equilibrium.svg.png
