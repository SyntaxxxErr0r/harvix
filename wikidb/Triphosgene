1.20	Triphosgene	Triphosgene	Triphosgene is a chemical compound that is used as a safer substitute for phosgene, because at room temperature it is a solid crystal, as opposed to phosgene which is a gas. Triphosgene crystals decompose at around 130 Â°C, although, the decomposition temperature of impure samples can be much lower. Triphosgene is used in organic synthesis to bond one carbonyl group to two alcohols, as in the synthesis of octalactin B. It is prepared by exhaustive chlorination of dimethyl carbonate.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Triphosgene-skeletal.png/200px-Triphosgene-skeletal.png
