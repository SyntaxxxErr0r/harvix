290.3	Geek	Geek	This word comes from English dialect geek, geck: fool, freak; from Low German geck, from Middle Low German. The root geck still survives in Dutch and Afrikaans gek: crazy, as well as some German dialects, and in the Alsatian word Gickeleshut: geek's hat, used in carnivals.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Mazda3-pi.jpg/220px-Mazda3-pi.jpg
