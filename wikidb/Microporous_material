7.10	Microporous_material	Microporous material	Microporous materials are also used in first aid, commonly under the tradename Micropore, first invented by 3M in 1959. Microporous adhesive tape can be used to affix dressings to wounds, and to hold bandages in place. If necessary it can be used to cover small wounds with gauze padding, usually as a temporary measure until a proper dressing and bandage are available. The steri-strip was derived from Microporous surgical tape.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Albupore_surgical_tape.jpg/250px-Albupore_surgical_tape.jpg
