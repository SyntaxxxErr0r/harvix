15.10	Honningsv%C3%A5g	Honningsvåg	·) at 70° 58' N, in Nordkapp municipality, claims to be the northernmost city in Norway and even in the world, although the title is disputed by Hammerfest, Norway; Barrow, Alaska; and Longyearbyen, Svalbard. Legislation effective from 1997 states that a Norwegian city must have 5,000 inhabitants, but Honningsvåg with its population of 2367 (in 2009) was declared a city in 1996, thus exempt from this legislation. It is situated at a bay on the southern side of Magerøya island, while the famous North Cape and its visitors center is on the northern side. It is a port of call for cruise ships, especially in the summer months. Honningsvåg Airport, Valan is located 4 km outside the town, with flights to mainly Tromsø.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Honningsv%C3%A5g-01.jpg/250px-Honningsv%C3%A5g-01.jpg
