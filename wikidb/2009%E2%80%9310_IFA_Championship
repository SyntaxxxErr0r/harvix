1.00	2009%E2%80%9310_IFA_Championship	2009–10 IFA Championship	The 2009–10 IFA Championship (known as the Ladbrokes.com Championship for sponsorship reasons) was the second season since its establishment after a major overhaul of the league system in Northern Ireland. It also marked the first season in which the Championship was divided into two divisions, with the clubs in both divisions having intermediate status. Championship 1 served as the second tier of Northern Irish football, with Championship 2 as the third tier. Loughgall were crowned champions of Championship 1 on 8 May 2010 after a 2–0 win over Ards. However, they were declined promotion because they did not have an IFA Domestic Licence. Therefore, Donegal Celtic entered into a two-leg play-off with the bottom club of the 2009–10 IFA Premiership, and achieved promotion with a 1–0 aggregate win. Harland &amp; Wolff Welders were champions of Championship 2, achieving promotion to Championship 1.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Ladbrokes_Championship_logo.jpg/200px-Ladbrokes_Championship_logo.jpg
