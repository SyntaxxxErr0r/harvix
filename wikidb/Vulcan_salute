57.7	Vulcan_salute	Vulcan salute	The Vulcan salute is a hand gesture consisting of a raised hand, palm forward with the fingers parted between the middle and ring finger, and the thumb extended. Often, the famous line, "Live long and prosper", is said after it. The salute was devised and popularised by Leonard Nimoy, who portrayed the half-Vulcan character Mr. Spock on the original Star Trek television series in the late 1960s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Leonard_Nimoy_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg/250px-Leonard_Nimoy_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg
