124.8	Roomba	Roomba	The Roomba is a series of autonomous robotic vacuum cleaners sold by iRobot. Under normal operating conditions, it is able to navigate a living space and common obstacles while vacuuming the floor. Several updates and new models have since been released that allow the Roombas to better negotiate obstacles and optimize cleaning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Roomba3g.jpg/220px-Roomba3g.jpg
