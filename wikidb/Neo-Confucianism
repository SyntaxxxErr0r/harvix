35.26	Neo-Confucianism	Neo-Confucianism	Neo-Confucianism has its origins in the Tang Dynasty; the Confucianist scholars Han Yu and Li Ao are seen as forbears of the Neo-Confucianists of the Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty philosopher Zhou Dunyi is seen as the first true "pioneer" of Neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy. Neo-Confucianism developed both as a renaissance of traditional Confucian ideas, and as a reaction to the ideas of Buddhism and religious Daoism. Although the Neo-Confucianists denounced Buddhist metaphysics, Neo-Confucianism did borrow Daoist and Buddhist terminology and concepts.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/%E5%BA%90%E5%B1%B1%E7%99%BD%E9%B9%BF%E6%B4%9E%E4%B9%A6%E9%99%A2%E5%91%A8%E6%95%A6%E9%A2%90%E9%93%9C%E5%83%8F.JPG/180px-%E5%BA%90%E5%B1%B1%E7%99%BD%E9%B9%BF%E6%B4%9E%E4%B9%A6%E9%99%A2%E5%91%A8%E6%95%A6%E9%A2%90%E9%93%9C%E5%83%8F.JPG
