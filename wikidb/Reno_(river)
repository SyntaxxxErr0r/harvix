3.00	Reno_(river)	Reno (river)	The Reno is a river of Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy. It is the tenth longest river in Italy (the sixth longest of those that flow directly into the sea) and the most important of the region apart from the Po. The name of the river has the same etymology as the German Rhein (Rhine River), as both derive from a Celtic word meaning "flowing (of water)" - itself a cognate of Greek ροήα "rhoia" which means "to flow".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/LocationRenoRiver.png/288px-LocationRenoRiver.png
