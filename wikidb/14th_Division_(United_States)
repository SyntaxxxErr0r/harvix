1.00	14th_Division_(United_States)	Divisions of the United States Army	This list of United States Army divisions is divided into three eras: 1911–1917, 1917–1941, and 1941–present. These eras represent the major evolutions of army division structure (there have been several minor changes during these times). The 1911–1917 era lists divisions raised during the Army's first attempts at modernizing the division, prior to the authorization of permanent divisions, and the 1917–1941 era lists the first permanent divisions, prior to advent of specialized (armored, airborne, etc.) divisions. The 1941–present era lists all of the divisions organized, raised, or authorized since then.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/WWISSI.jpg/220px-WWISSI.jpg
