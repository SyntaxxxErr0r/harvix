4.01	Artmedia	Artmedia	Artmedia, Seminar and Laboratory of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication, was one of the first scientific projects concerning the relationship between art, technology, philosophy and aesthetics. It was founded in 1985 at the University of Salerno. For over two decades, until 2009, dozens of projects, studies, exhibitions and conferences on new technologies made Artmedia a reference point for many internationally renowned scholars and artists, and contributed to the growing cultural interest in the aesthetics of media, the aesthetics of networks, and their ethical and anthropological implications.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/DeKerckhove_Berger_Costa_ArtmediaIV_1992.JPG/220px-DeKerckhove_Berger_Costa_ArtmediaIV_1992.JPG
