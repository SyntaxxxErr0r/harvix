61.0	Catalysis	Catalysis	Catalysis is the change in rate of a chemical reaction due to the participation of a substance called a catalyst. Unlike other reagents that participate in the chemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself. A catalyst may participate in multiple chemical transformations. Catalysts that speed the reaction are called positive catalysts. Substances that slow a catalyst's effect in a chemical reaction are called inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Heterogeneous_cat.JPG/292px-Heterogeneous_cat.JPG
