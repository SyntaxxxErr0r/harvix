58.5	Anabolic_steroid	Anabolic steroid	The use of gonadal steroids pre-dates their identification and isolation. Medical use of testicle extract began in the late 19th century while its effects on strength were still being studied. The isolation of gonadal steroids can be traced back to 1931, when Adolf Butenandt, a chemist in Marburg, purified 15 milligrams of the male hormone androstenone from tens of thousands of litres of urine. This steroid was subsequently synthesized in 1934 by Leopold Ruzicka, a chemist in Zurich.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Testosteron.svg/220px-Testosteron.svg.png
