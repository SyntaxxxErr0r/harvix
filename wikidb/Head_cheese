54.9	Head_cheese	Head cheese	Head cheese , or brawn (BrE), is a cold cut that originated in Europe. A version pickled with vinegar is known as souse. Head cheese is not a cheese but a terrine or meat jelly made with flesh from the head of a calf or pig (sometimes a sheep or cow), and often set in aspic. Which parts of the head are used can vary, but the brain, eyes, and ears are usually removed. The tongue, and sometimes even the feet and heart, may be included.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Head_cheese.jpg/220px-Head_cheese.jpg
