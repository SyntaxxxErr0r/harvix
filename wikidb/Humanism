167.4	Humanism	Humanism	Humanism is an approach in study, philosophy, world view or practice that focuses on human values and concerns, attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. According to Greg M. Epstein, "Humanism today can be categorized as a movement, a philosophy of life or worldview, or ... lifestance." In philosophy and social science, humanism is a perspective which affirms some notion of human nature, and is contrasted with anti-humanism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/HumanismSymbol.svg/120px-HumanismSymbol.svg.png
