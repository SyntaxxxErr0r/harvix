4.00	KPV	KPV heavy machine gun	The KPV-14.5 heavy machine gun (Krupnokaliberniy Pulemyot Vladimirova, in Russian as Крупнокалиберный Пулемёт Владимирова, or КПВ) is a Soviet designed 14.5x114mm-caliber heavy machine gun, which first entered service as an infantry weapon (designated PKP) in 1949. In the 1960s the infantry version was taken out of production because it was too big and heavy. It was later redesigned for anti-aircraft use, because it showed excellent results as an AA gun, with a range of 3,000 meters horizontally and 2,000 meters vertically against low flying planes. It was used in the ZPU series of anti-aircraft guns. Its size and power also made it a useful light anti-armour weapon on the BTR series of vehicles and the BRDM-2 scout car.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/14%2C5-%D0%BC%D0%BC_%D1%81%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%9B%D0%B5%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%97%D0%9F%D0%A3-4_%284%29.jpg/300px-14%2C5-%D0%BC%D0%BC_%D1%81%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%9B%D0%B5%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%97%D0%9F%D0%A3-4_%284%29.jpg
