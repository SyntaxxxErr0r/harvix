These radio stations are licensed low-power AM radio stations set up by local transport departments to provide bulletins to motorists and other travelers regarding traffic and other delays. They are often near highways and airports, and occasionally other tourism attractions such as national parks. In the latter case, they often provide a loop of prerecorded information about the park's historic and other background information.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Thruway_Info_%281%29.jpg/200px-Thruway_Info_%281%29.jpg
