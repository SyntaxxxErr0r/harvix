He committed the crime as Lennon and Yoko Ono were outside The Dakota apartment building in New York City. Chapman directed five gunshots at Lennon, hitting him four times in his back. He remained at the scene until the police arrested him, and had a copy of the book The Catcher in the Rye. He repeatedly claimed that the novel he was reading was his statement.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Markchapmanmugshot.jpg/200px-Markchapmanmugshot.jpg
