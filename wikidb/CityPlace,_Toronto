8.10	CityPlace,_Toronto	CityPlace, Toronto	CityPlace is the name given to a large section of former railway land in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada that has been redeveloped for multi-use purpose. The term has been more recently used for a large up-scale multi-tower condo development in the Harbourfront district. When completed, this area will be the largest residential development ever created in Toronto's history. The area is bordered by Bathurst Street to the west, Lake Shore Boulevard to the south, and Front Street to the north and Blue Jays Way and the Rogers Centre to the east. Cityplace is also a 5-10 minute walk from King Street West and Liberty Village and a 10-20 minute walk from Toronto's financial district. The neighborhood is also home to the Canoe Landing Park designed by famed Canadian writer and artist Douglas Coupland.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/CityPlace_Towers_Building_Toronto.jpg/250px-CityPlace_Towers_Building_Toronto.jpg
