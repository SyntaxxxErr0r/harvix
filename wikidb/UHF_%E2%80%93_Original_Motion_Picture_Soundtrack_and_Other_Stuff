2.00	UHF_%E2%80%93_Original_Motion_Picture_Soundtrack_and_Other_Stuff	UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff	UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff (1989) is the sixth studio album by "Weird Al" Yankovic. The album featured many music cuts from the film as well as some of the commercials ("Spatula City") and other parody bits ("Gandhi II"). The album also featured new original material such as "The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota", which brought the running order up to album length. Skits written by Jay Levey, such as "Conan the Librarian" and "Plots R Us" are omitted, as is the original score by John Du Prez. It would be the last Weird Al album to be released as a vinyl record until 2011's Alpocalypse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c0/UHFsingle.jpg/220px-UHFsingle.jpg
