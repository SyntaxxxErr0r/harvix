73.2	Espionage_Act_of_1917	Espionage Act of 1917	Much of the Act's enforcement was left to the discretion of local United States Attorneys, so enforcement varied widely. For example, Socialist Kate Richards O'Hare gave the same speech in several states, but was convicted and sentenced to a prison term of five years for delivering her speech in North Dakota. Most enforcement activity occurred in the Western states where the I.W.W. was active. Finally Gregory, a few weeks before the end of the war, instructed the U.S. Attorneys not to act without his approval.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Blessed_are_the_Peacemakers.gif/220px-Blessed_are_the_Peacemakers.gif
