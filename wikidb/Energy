199.6	Energy	Energy	In physics, energy is an indirectly observed quantity. It is often understood as the ability a physical system has to do work on other physical systems. Since work is defined as a force acting through a distance (a length of space), energy is always equivalent to the ability to exert pulls or pushes against the basic forces of nature, along a path of a certain length.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Lightning_over_Oradea_Romania_zoom.jpg/300px-Lightning_over_Oradea_Romania_zoom.jpg
