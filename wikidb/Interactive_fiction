104.1	Interactive_fiction	Interactive fiction	Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, describes software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives and as video games. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be "text-only". Graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is text. It can also be used to distinguish the more modern style of such works, focusing on narrative and not necessarily falling into the adventure game genre at all, from the more traditional focus on puzzles. More expansive definitions of interactive fiction may refer to all adventure games, including wholly graphical adventures such as Myst.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Zork_I_screenshot_video_game_Gargoyle_interpreter_on_Ubuntu_Linux.png/256px-Zork_I_screenshot_video_game_Gargoyle_interpreter_on_Ubuntu_Linux.png
