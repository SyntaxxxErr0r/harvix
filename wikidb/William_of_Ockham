80.3	William_of_Ockham	William of Ockham	William of Ockham (also Occam, Hockham, or several other spellings; c. 1288 â€“ c. 1348) was an English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher, who is believed to have been born in Ockham, a small village in Surrey. He is considered to be one of the major figures of medieval thought and was at the centre of the major intellectual and political controversies of the fourteenth century. Although he is commonly known for Occam's razor, the methodological principle that bears his name, William of Ockham also produced significant works on logic, physics, and theology. In the Church of England, his day of commemoration is 10 April.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/William_of_Ockham.png/220px-William_of_Ockham.png
