78.2	Root	Root	In vascular plants, the root is the organ of a plant that typically lies below the surface of the soil. This is not always the case, however, since a root can also be aerial (growing above the ground) or aerating (growing up above the ground or especially above water). Furthermore, a stem normally occurring below ground is not exceptional either (see rhizome). So, it is better to define root as a part of a plant body that bears no leaves, and therefore also lacks nodes. There are also important internal structural differences between stems and roots.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Primary_and_secondary_cotton_roots.jpg/250px-Primary_and_secondary_cotton_roots.jpg
