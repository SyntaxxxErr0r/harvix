18.32	Purple_Moon	Purple Moon	Purple Moon was an American software company based in Mountain View, California, targeted at young girls between the ages of 8 and 14. The company was founded by Brenda Laurel and others, and supported by Interval Research. They debuted their first two games, Rockett's New School and Secret Paths in the Forest, in 1997. Both games were more or less visual novels and encouraged values like friendship and decision making. The company faced criticism including charges of sexism (mostly due to their belief that girls would not enjoy the more popular action-oriented games often associated with boys and young men) and ethnic stereotyping.
