58.5	White_phosphorus	White phosphorus	White phosphorus is a material made from a common allotrope of the chemical element phosphorus that is used in smoke, tracer, illumination and incendiary munitions. Other common names include WP, and the slang term "Willie Pete," which is dated from its use in Vietnam, and is still sometimes used in military jargon. As an incendiary weapon, white phosphorus burns fiercely and can set cloth, fuel, ammunition and other combustibles on fire, and cause serious burns or death.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/White_phosphorus_glowing_e17.png/320px-White_phosphorus_glowing_e17.png
