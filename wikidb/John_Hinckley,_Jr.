He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and has remained under institutional psychiatric care since then. Public outcry over the verdict led to the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/John_Hinckley%2C_Jr._Mugshot.png/220px-John_Hinckley%2C_Jr._Mugshot.png
