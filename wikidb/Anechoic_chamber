62.9	Anechoic_chamber	Anechoic chamber	An anechoic chamber (an-echoic meaning non-echoing or echo-free) is a room designed to stop reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves. They are also insulated from exterior sources of noise. The combination of both aspects means they simulate a quiet open-space of infinite dimension, which is useful when exterior influences would otherwise give false results.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Anechoic_chamber.jpg/200px-Anechoic_chamber.jpg
