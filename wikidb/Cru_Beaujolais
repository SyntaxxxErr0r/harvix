4.00	Cru_Beaujolais	Beaujolais (wine)	Beaujolais is a French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) wine generally made of the Gamay grape which has a thin skin and is low in tannins. Like most AOC wines they are not labeled varietally. Whites from the region, which make up only 1% of its production, are made mostly with Chardonnay grapes though Aligoté is also permitted. Beaujolais tends to be a very light-bodied red wine, with relatively high amounts of acidity. In some vintages, Beaujolais produces more wine than the Burgundy wine regions of Chablis, Côte d'Or, Côte Chalonnaise and Mâconnais put together.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Carte_vignoble_beaujolais.png/220px-Carte_vignoble_beaujolais.png
