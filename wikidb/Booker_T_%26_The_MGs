2.00	Booker_T_%26_The_MGs	Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s	Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s is an instrumental R&amp;B band that was influential in shaping the sound of southern soul and Memphis soul. Original members of the group were Booker T. Jones (organ, piano), Steve Cropper (guitar), Lewie Steinberg (bass), and Al Jackson, Jr. (drums). In the 1960s, as members of the house band of Stax Records, they played on hundreds of recordings by artists such as Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Bill Withers, Sam &amp; Dave, Carla and Rufus Thomas and Johnnie Taylor. They also released instrumental records under their own name, such as the 1962 hit single "Green Onions". As originators of the unique Stax sound, the group was one of the most prolific, respected, and imitated of their era. By the mid-1960s, bands on both sides of the Atlantic were trying to sound like Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Booker_T._%26_the_M.G.%27s_Tunica%2C_Mississippi_2002.jpg/220px-Booker_T._%26_the_M.G.%27s_Tunica%2C_Mississippi_2002.jpg
