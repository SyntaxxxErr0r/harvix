70.1	Garamond	Garamond	Garamond is the name given to a group of old-style serif typefaces named after the punch-cutter Claude Garamond (c. 1480–1561). Most of the Garamond faces are more closely related to the work of a later punch-cutter, Jean Jannon. A direct relationship between Garamond’s letterforms and contemporary type can be found in the Roman versions of the typefaces Adobe Garamond, Granjon, Sabon, and Stempel Garamond.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/AdobeGaramondSp.svg/220px-AdobeGaramondSp.svg.png
