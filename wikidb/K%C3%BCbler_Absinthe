10.23	K%C3%BCbler_Absinthe	Kübler Absinthe	Kübler Absinthe Superieure is a brand of absinthe, distilled in the Val-de-Travers region of Switzerland also known as the birthplace of absinthe'. Kübler Absinthe was first produced in 1863 and was the first brand to be sold legally in Switzerland after the national ban on absinthe was lifted in March, 2005. The legalization of absinthe in Switzerland is largely due to Kübler's lobbying efforts. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau approved the formula for Kübler Absinthe in 2004, and approved the product for sale in the United States in May 2007 after three years of discussions among Kübler, FDA, TTB, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These discussions proved to be instrumental in opening the door for many brands of absinthe to be legally sold or produced in the United States.
