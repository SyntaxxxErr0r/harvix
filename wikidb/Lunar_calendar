59.6	Lunar_calendar	Lunar calendar	Most lunar calendars are in fact lunisolar calendars. That is, months reflect the lunar cycle, but then intercalary months (e.g. "second Adar" in the Hebrew calendar) are added to bring the calendar year into synchronisation with the solar year. Some examples are the Chinese and Hindu calendars, and most calendar systems used in antiquity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Full_Moon_Luc_Viatour.jpg/120px-Full_Moon_Luc_Viatour.jpg
