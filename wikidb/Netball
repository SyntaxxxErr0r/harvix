62.4	Netball	Netball	Netball is a ball sport played between two teams of seven players. Its development, derived from early versions of basketball, began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA)) was formed. As of 2011, IFNA comprises more than 60 national teams organized into five global regions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/MalawiFijiNetball.jpg/250px-MalawiFijiNetball.jpg
