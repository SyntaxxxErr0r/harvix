30.57	War_Eagle	War Eagle	War Eagle is a motto or battle cry of supporters of Auburn University sports teams—especially the Auburn Tigers football team—and, for all intents and purposes, for Auburn University in general. It is also the title of the university's fight song (see below). War Eagle is also a common term of endearment, greeting, or salutation among the Auburn 'family' (e.g., students, alumni, fans), along with the colorful variation "War Damn Eagle," which is sometimes abbreviated in written form as "WDE." It is incorrect to say the War Eagle battle cry in the plural, as in "War Eagles".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/GoldenEagle-Nova.jpg/250px-GoldenEagle-Nova.jpg
