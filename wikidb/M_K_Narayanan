7.42	M_K_Narayanan	M. K. Narayanan	Mayankote Kelath Narayanan (Malayalam: ) (born 23 July 1934), commonly referred to as M. K. Narayanan, is the current Governor of Indian state West Bengal and was the National Security Advisor (NSA) to the Prime Minister of India until January 2010. He was appointed to this post on January 25, 2005, three weeks after the previous NSA, J. N. Dixit, died on January 3, 2005. He offered to resign on 30 November 2008 over the attacks in Mumbai that killed nearly 200 people, but his resignation was not accepted by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He experienced heavy criticism after the Mumbai terrorist attacks due to his preoccupation with Sri Lanka and the LTTE, instead of what others considered to be India's chief threat, Kashmiri insurgents and Pakistan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Msc_2006-Sunday%2C_11.00_-_13.00-Narayanan.jpg/220px-Msc_2006-Sunday%2C_11.00_-_13.00-Narayanan.jpg
