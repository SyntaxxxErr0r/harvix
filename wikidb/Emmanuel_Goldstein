70.7	Emmanuel_Goldstein	Emmanuel Goldstein	Emmanuel Goldstein is a character in George Orwell's classic dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. He is the number one enemy of the people according to Big Brother and the Party, who heads a mysterious and possibly fictitious anti-party organization called The Brotherhood. Despite being a key part of the story, he is only actually seen and heard on telescreen, and may in fact be nothing more than a useful propaganda fabrication of the Ministry of Truth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/1984EmmanuelGoldstein.jpg/285px-1984EmmanuelGoldstein.jpg
