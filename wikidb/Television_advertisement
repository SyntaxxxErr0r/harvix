62.7	Television_advertisement	Television advertisement	A television advertisement or television commercial, often just commercial, advert, ad, or ad-film (India) â€“ is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length infomercials). Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the dawn of television.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Radio_News_Sep_1928_Cover.jpg/220px-Radio_News_Sep_1928_Cover.jpg
