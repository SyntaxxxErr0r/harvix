4.10	Ideolect	Idiolect	In linguistics, an idiolect is a variety of a language unique to one individual person. It is manifested by patterns of vocabulary or idiom selection (the individual's lexicon), grammar, or pronunciations that are unique to the individual. Every individual's language production is in some sense unique. Linguists disagree about exactly what is shared, in terms of the underlying knowledge of the language, among speakers of the same language or dialect.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Languages_world_map-transparent_background.svg/150px-Languages_world_map-transparent_background.svg.png
