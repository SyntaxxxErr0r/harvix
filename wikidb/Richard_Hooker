21.04	Richard_Hooker	Richard Hooker	Richard Hooker (March 1554 â€“ 3 November 1600) was an Anglican priest and an influential theologian. Hooker's emphases on reason, tolerance and the value of tradition came to exert a lasting influence on the development of the Church of England. In retrospect he has been taken (with Thomas Cranmer and Matthew Parker) as a founder of Anglicanism in its theological thought.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Wenceslas_Hollar_-_Richard_Hooker_%28State_1%29.jpg/161px-Wenceslas_Hollar_-_Richard_Hooker_%28State_1%29.jpg
