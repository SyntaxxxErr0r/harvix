2.00	Vauxhall_Conference	Football Conference	The Football Conference is a football league in England which consists of three divisions called Conference National, Conference North, and Conference South. Some Football Conference clubs are fully professional, such as York City, but most of them are semi-professional (see full listing of clubs below). Conference National is the fifth and lowest of the five nationwide football divisions in England, below the Premier League and the three divisions of the Football League, and the top tier of the National League System of non-League football. Conference North and Conference South form the sixth tier of English football. The Football Conference consisted of only one division up until 2004, but expanded as part of an extensive restructuring of the National League System which took effect beginning with the 2004â€“05 season.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/65/Football_Conference.png/220px-Football_Conference.png
