89.6	Allies_of_World_War_II	Allies of World War II	The Allies of World War II were the countries that opposed the Axis powers during the Second World War (1939â€“1945). The Allies became involved in World War II either because they had already been invaded, were directly threatened with invasion by the Axis or because they were concerned that the Axis powers would come to control the world.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Tehran_Conference%2C_1943.jpg/240px-Tehran_Conference%2C_1943.jpg
