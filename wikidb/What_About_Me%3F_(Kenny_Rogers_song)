(Kenny Rogers song)	"What About Me?" is the title of a song first recorded in 1984 as a trio by singers Kenny Rogers, Kim Carnes and James Ingram. The song was written by Rogers, noted producer David Foster and singer-songwriter Richard Marx, who had yet to achieve the fame as a musician that he would a few years later ("Right Here Waiting", "Now and Forever"). It was the lead single from Rogers' 1984 album of the same name.
