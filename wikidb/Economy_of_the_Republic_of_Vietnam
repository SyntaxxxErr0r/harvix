3.20	Economy_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam	Economy of the Republic of Vietnam	The Republic of Vietnam had a market, developing and open economy. The economy of this country was highly free from 1963 to 1973. Nevertheless, economic development was based largely on five-year economic plans or four-year economic plans. Its economy stayed stable in the 10 first years, then it faced difficulties due to the escalation of the war which led to unsteady economic growth, high state budget deficits, high inflation and trade deficits. The South Vietnamese government had to conduct land reforms twice. The United States played an important role in this economy through economic and technical aid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/RVN-Economic.png/350px-RVN-Economic.png
