178.8	Jim_Crow_laws	Jim Crow laws	The Jim Crow laws were state and local laws in the United States enacted between 1876 and 1965. They mandated de jure racial segregation in all public facilities in Southern states of the former Confederacy, with a supposedly "separate but equal" status for black Americans. The separation led to treatment, financial support and accommodations that were usually inferior to those provided for white Americans, systematizing a number of economic, educational and social disadvantages. De jure segregation mainly applied to the Southern United States. Northern segregation was generally de facto, with patterns of segregation in housing enforced by covenants, bank lending practices, and job discrimination, including discriminatory union practices for decades.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Jim_Crow_Jubilee_%28Boston_Public_Library%29.jpg/220px-Jim_Crow_Jubilee_%28Boston_Public_Library%29.jpg
