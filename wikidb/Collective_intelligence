155.0	Collective_intelligence	Collective intelligence	Collective intelligence is a shared or group intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition of many individuals and appears in consensus decision making in bacteria, animals, humans and computer networks. The term appears in sociobiology, political science and in context of mass peer review and crowdsourcing applications. This broader definition involves consensus, social capital and formalisms such as voting systems, social media and other means of quantifying mass activity. Everything from a political party to a public wiki can reasonably be described as this loose form of collective intelligence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/CI_types1s.jpg/350px-CI_types1s.jpg
