Maso's name and work are known to us from the autobiography of Lorenzo Ghiberti, I Commentari, which identifies frescoes in the chapel of the Holy Confessors at Santa Croce in Florence as his chief work. The frescoes represent the Life of St. Sylvester , the Last Judgment, and The Entombment and were probably painted about 1340.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Popesylvesterdragon.jpg/220px-Popesylvesterdragon.jpg
