2.00	Paternally	Paternal bond	A paternal bond refers to the relationship between a father and his child. In the U.S., legal paternity is presumed for the husband of the mother unless a separate action is taken; an unmarried man may establish paternity by signing a voluntary recognition of paternity or by taking court action. Paternity may also be established between a man and a younger person, commonly in adoption, without the two being biologically related.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Duncan_Jones_and_David_Bowie_at_the_premiere_of_Moon.jpg/220px-Duncan_Jones_and_David_Bowie_at_the_premiere_of_Moon.jpg
