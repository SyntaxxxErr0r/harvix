6.01	Lerdrit	Lerdrit	Lerdrit is a Thai form of martial arts taught and used by the commandos of the Royal Thai Army. Muay Lert Rit (or Lerdit) is a style of fighting derived from traditional Thai battlefield fighting techniques (Muay Boran). A selection was made among the very large portfolio of techniques already available in the different styles and adapted to close combat. Many of the techniques are either very close or taken directly from the Mae Mai (Standard techniques for bare hand fighting) or the Look Mai (Advanced fighting techniques). As with all military techniques, the goal is radical, with disabling in a terminal way your opponent.
