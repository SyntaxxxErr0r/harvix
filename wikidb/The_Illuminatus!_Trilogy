51.5	The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy	The Illuminatus! Trilogy	The Illuminatus! Trilogy is a series of three novels written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson first published in 1975. The trilogy is a satirical, postmodern, science fiction-influenced adventure story; a drug-, sex-, and magic-laden trek through a number of conspiracy theories, both historical and imaginary, related to the authors' version of the Illuminati. The narrative often switches between third and first person perspectives and jumps around in time. It is thematically dense, covering topics like counterculture, numerology, and Discordianism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Illuminatus1sted.jpg/200px-Illuminatus1sted.jpg
