1.01	A102_road	A102 road	The A102 is a road that starts in Clapton in the north London Borough of Hackney and ends in Kidbrooke in the south Royal Borough of Greenwich. The A102 was formerly a continuous route including two motorway sections classified as the A102(M) however, subsequent to the renumbering of part of the route in 1999, the A102 designation belongs only to the section including the Blackwall Tunnel linking the A12 and the A2 and also to the section from Clapton to Hackney Wick.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/UK_road_A102.svg/157px-UK_road_A102.svg.png
