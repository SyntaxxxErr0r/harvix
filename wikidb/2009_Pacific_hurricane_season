The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 for the central Pacific, and officially ended on November 30, 2009. For the first time in ten years, no tropical depressions formed during the month of May. This inactivity continued into the early part of June and was the least active since 1994. The first named storm of the season did not develop until June 21, marking the latest start to a Pacific hurricane season in 40 years. However, the NHC's tropical weather summary, released in early September, found that August 2009, with seven named storms, was one of the most active Augusts on record for the basin. This level of activity had rarely occurred, if at all, in the past 41 years, since 1968, when the most active August on record for the eastern Pacific with eight named storms occurred. When Hurricane Rick reached Category 5 strength on October 17, 2009, it became the first Category 5 Eastern Pacific hurricane since Kenna in 2002, and the second-strongest Pacific hurricane on record, behind 1997's Linda.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/2009_Pacific_hurricane_season_summary_map.png/300px-2009_Pacific_hurricane_season_summary_map.png
