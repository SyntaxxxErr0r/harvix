54.4	Psychological_resilience	Psychological resilience	Resilience in children refers to individuals who are doing better than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Simply put, resilience requires two conditions to be met: (1) the child must have experienced some sort of risk or adversity that has been linked with poor outcomes, and (2) the child is generally doing okay despite being exposed to that risk or adversity; they are not showing that poor outcome.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/FEMA_-_14728_-_Photograph_by_Mark_Wolfe_taken_on_09-04-2005_in_Mississippi.jpg/220px-FEMA_-_14728_-_Photograph_by_Mark_Wolfe_taken_on_09-04-2005_in_Mississippi.jpg
