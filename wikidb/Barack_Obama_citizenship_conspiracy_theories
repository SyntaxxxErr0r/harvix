110.0	Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories	Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories	Conspiracy theories about the citizenship of Barack Obama claim that Barack Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the United States and is therefore not eligible to be President of the United States under Article Two of the U.S. Constitution. Some theories allege that Obama was born in Kenya, not Hawaii, or that his birth certificate is a forgery. Others allege that Obama became a citizen of Indonesia and lost his U.S. citizenship. Still others claim that because Obama's father was from Kenya, that means he held dual citizenship at birth (British and American), and the supposed dual citizenship means Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the United States. These theories have been characterized by some commentators as racist, or a racial reaction to the first African American president of the United States.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Billboard_Challenging_the_validity_of_Barack_Obama%27s_Birth_Certificate.JPG/220px-Billboard_Challenging_the_validity_of_Barack_Obama%27s_Birth_Certificate.JPG
