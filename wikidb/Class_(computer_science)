83.4	Class_(computer_science)	Class (computer programming)	In object-oriented programming, a class is a construct that is used as a blueprint to create instances of itself â€“ referred to as class instances, class objects, instance objects or simply objects. A class defines constituent members which enable these class instances to have state and behavior. Data field members enable a class object to maintain state. Other kinds of members, especially methods, enable a class object's behavior. Class instances are of the type of the associated class.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Oop-uml-class-example.png
