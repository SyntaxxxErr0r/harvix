57.1	Hey_Jude	Hey Jude	"Hey Jude" is a song by the English rock band The Beatles, written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennonâ€“McCartney. The ballad evolved from "Hey Jules", a song widely accepted as being written to comfort John Lennon's son, Julian, during his parents' divorce. This account is not universally accepted, though, and McCartney has even given conflicting explanations. "Hey Jude" begins with a verse-bridge structure based around McCartney's vocal performance and piano accompaniment; further instrumentation is added as the song progresses to distinguish sections. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a fade-out coda that lasts for more than four minutes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c9/Hey_Jude_Beatles.jpg/220px-Hey_Jude_Beatles.jpg
