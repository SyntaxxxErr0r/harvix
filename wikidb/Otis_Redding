68.6	Otis_Redding	Otis Redding	Otis Ray Redding, Jr. (September 9, 1941 â€“ December 10, 1967) was an American soul singer-songwriter, record producer, arranger, and talent scout. He is considered one of the major figures in soul music and rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). His open-throated singing was an influence on other soul singers of the 1960s, and he helped to craft the lean and powerful style of R&amp;B that formed the basis of the Stax Sound. After appearing at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, he wrote and recorded "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay", which went on to become a number-one record on both the pop and R&amp;B charts after his death in a plane crash.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Otis_Redding.jpg
