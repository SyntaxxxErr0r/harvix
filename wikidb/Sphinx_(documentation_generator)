8.30	Sphinx_(documentation_generator)	Sphinx (documentation generator)	Sphinx is a documentation generator which converts reStructuredText files into HTML websites and other formats including PDF, EPub and man. It exploits the extensible nature of reStructuredText through a number of extensions (e.g. for autogenerating documentation from source code, writing mathematical notation or highlighting source code). The first public release, version 0.1.61611, was announced on March 21, 2008. It was developed for, and used extensively by, the Python project for documentation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Sphinx_Python_Documentation_Logo.png/240px-Sphinx_Python_Documentation_Logo.png
