98.5	Axolotl	Axolotl	The axolotl ( ), Ambystoma mexicanum, is a neotenic salamander, closely related to the Tiger Salamander. Larvae of this species fail to undergo metamorphosis, so the adults remain aquatic and gilled. It is also called ajolote (which is also a common name for different types of salamander). The species originates from numerous lakes, such as Lake Xochimilco underlying Mexico City. Axolotls are used extensively in scientific research due to their ability to regenerate limbs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Axolotl_ganz.jpg/250px-Axolotl_ganz.jpg
