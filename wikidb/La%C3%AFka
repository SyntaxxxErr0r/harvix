Also called folk song or urban folk music (Gr: αστική λαϊκή μουσική or λαϊκά τραγούδια laïká (tragoudia)), in its plural form is a Greek music genre which has taken many forms over the years. As it was the case with éntekhno, laïkó emerged after the popularization of rebetiko; An influence of laïkó can be most strongly seen in 1960s Greek music. Although the term is used to describe the whole of the Greek popular music, when used in context it refers mostly to the form it took in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/Marinella-liveathinonarena.jpg/160px-Marinella-liveathinonarena.jpg
