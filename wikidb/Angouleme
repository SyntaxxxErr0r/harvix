6.13	Angouleme	Angoulême	Old capital of the Angoumois in the Ancien Régime, Angoulême was a fortified town very coveted because of its position at the crossroad of important communication roads and suffered many sieges. From its tumultuous past, the city, perched on a rocky spur, inherited a large historical, religious and urban patrimony, which attracts a lot of tourists.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Cat01.jpg/270px-Cat01.jpg
