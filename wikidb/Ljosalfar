1.00	Ljosalfar	Dökkálfar and Ljósálfar	In Norse mythology, Dökkálfar and Ljósálfar (Old Norse "Light Elves", singular Ljósálfr) are two contrasting types of elves; the prior dwell within the earth and are most swarthy, while the latter live in Álfheimr, located in heaven, and are "fairer than the sun to look at". The Dökkálfar and the Ljósálfar are solely attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have produced theories about the origin and implications of the dualistic concept.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/%C3%84lvalek.jpg/250px-%C3%84lvalek.jpg
