108.7	Babylon	Babylon	Babylon was an Akkadian city-state (founded in 1867 BC by an Amorite dynasty) of ancient Mesopotamia, the remains of which are found in present-day Al Hillah, Babylon Province, Iraq, about 85 kilometers (55 mi) south of Baghdad. All that remains of the original ancient famed city of Babylon today is a mound, or tell, of broken mud-brick buildings and debris in the fertile Mesopotamian plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The city itself was built upon the Euphrates, and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Hammurabi%27s_Babylonia_1.svg/400px-Hammurabi%27s_Babylonia_1.svg.png
