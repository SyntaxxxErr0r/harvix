2.00	River_Thames_Whale	River Thames whale	The River Thames whale was a juvenile female Northern Bottlenose whale which was discovered swimming in the River Thames in central London on Friday 20 January 2006. According to the BBC, she was five metres (16 ft) long and weighed about seven tonnes (24,400 lb). The whale appeared to have been lost, as her normal habitat would have been around the coasts of the far north of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and in the seas around the Arctic Ocean. It was the first time the species had been seen in the Thames since records began in 1913. She died from convulsions as she was being rescued shortly after 19:00 GMT on 21 January 2006.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Thames_Whale_Rescue.jpg/350px-Thames_Whale_Rescue.jpg
