72.1	D._B._Cooper	D. B. Cooper	D. B. Cooper is the name popularly used to refer to an unidentified man who hijacked a Boeing 727 aircraft in the airspace between Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington on November 24, 1971. He extorted $200,000 in ransom and parachuted to an uncertain fate. Despite an extensive manhunt and an exhaustive (and ongoing) FBI investigation, the perpetrator has never been located or positively identified. The case remains the only unsolved air piracy in American aviation history.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/DBCooper.jpg/220px-DBCooper.jpg
