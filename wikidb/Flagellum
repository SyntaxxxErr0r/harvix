57.4	Flagellum	Flagellum	A flagellum (plural: flagella) is a lash-like appendage that protrudes from the cell body of certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The word flagellum is the Latin word for whip. The canonical role of the flagellum is locomotion but it also often has function as a sensory organelle, being sensitive to chemicals and temperatures outside the cell. Flagella are organelles defined by function rather than structure. There are large differences between different types of flagellum; the prokaryotic and eukaryotic flagella differ greatly in protein composition, structure, and mechanism of propulsion, however both are used for swimming.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Flagellum_base_diagram_en.svg/350px-Flagellum_base_diagram_en.svg.png
