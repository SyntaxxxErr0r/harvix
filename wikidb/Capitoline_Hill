51.5	Capitoline_Hill	Capitoline Hill	The Capitoline Hill ( or ; Latin: Collis Capitōlīnus), between the Forum and the Campus Martius, is one of the seven hills of Rome. It was the citadel (equivalent of the ancient Greek acropolis) of the earliest Romans. By the 16th century, Capitolinus had become Capitolino in Italian, with the alternative Campidoglio stemming from Capitolium. The English word capitol derives from Capitoline. The Capitoline contains few ancient ground-level ruins, as they are almost entirely covered up by Medieval and Renaissance palaces (now housing the Capitoline Museums) that surround a piazza, a significant urban plan designed by Michelangelo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Rmn-social-header-1-.svg/268px-Rmn-social-header-1-.svg.png
