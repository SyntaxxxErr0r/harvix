52.1	Bootstrapping_(statistics)	Bootstrapping (statistics)	In statistics, bootstrapping is a method for assigning measures of accuracy to sample estimates (Efron and Tibshirani 1993). This technique allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic using only very simple methods (Varian 2005). Generally, it falls in the broader class of resampling methods.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/MedianHists.png
