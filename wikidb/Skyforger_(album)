3.10	Skyforger_(album)	Skyforger (album)	Skyforger is the ninth studio album by Finnish heavy metal band Amorphis. Like the previous album, the lyrics to Skyforger are English translations of Finnish poems based on the Kalevala and written by Pekka Kainulainen. Unlike the two previous albums, it is based on different parts of several episodes, but all told from a single character's point of view. In this sense it is a return to Tales from the Thousand Lakes which told stories from different parts of the Kalevala. The last two albums focused on Kullervo and Lemmink√§inen, respectively, and this one focuses on Ilmarinen.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/Amorphis_-_Skyforger.JPG/220px-Amorphis_-_Skyforger.JPG
