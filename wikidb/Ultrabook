33.38	Ultrabook	Ultrabook	An Ultrabook is a higher-end type of subnotebook defined by Intel. Intel has applied to register the name as a trademark. Ultrabooks are designed to feature reduced size and weight, and extended battery life without compromising performance. They use low-power Intel processors with integrated graphics, solid-state drives for responsiveness, and unibody chassis to fit larger batteries into smaller cases. Because of their extremely thin profile, the number of external ports (e.g. USB) is limited.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Asus_x21_ultrabook.jpg/220px-Asus_x21_ultrabook.jpg
