72.5	Crips	Crips	The Crips are a primarily, but not exclusively, African-American gang. They were founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1969 mainly by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams. What was once a single alliance between two autonomous gangs is now a loosely connected network of individual sets, often engaged in open warfare with one another.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Crip_tattoos.jpg
