The origins of the British peerage are obscure but while the ranks of baron and earl perhaps predate the British peerage itself, the ranks of duke and marquess were introduced to England in the 14th century. The rank of viscount came later, in the mid-15th century. Peers were summoned to Parliament, forming the House of Lords.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Queen_Anne_in_the_House_of_Lords.jpg/200px-Queen_Anne_in_the_House_of_Lords.jpg
