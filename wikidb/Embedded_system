94.0	Embedded_system	Embedded system	An embedded system is a computer system designed for specific control functions within a larger system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. By contrast, a general-purpose computer, such as a personal computer (PC), is designed to be flexible and to meet a wide range of end-user needs. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/ADSL_modem_router_internals_labeled.jpg/300px-ADSL_modem_router_internals_labeled.jpg
