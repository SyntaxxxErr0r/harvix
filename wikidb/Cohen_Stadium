2.20	Cohen_Stadium	Cohen Stadium	Cohen Stadium is a stadium on the Northeast side of El Paso, Texas, by the Patriot Freeway, next to the Franklin Mountains. It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the El Paso Diablos minor league baseball team. It opened in 1990 and holds 9,725 people. The park is known as being an extremely hitter-friendly park, due to its high elevation, low humidity, and favorable wind currents toward the outfield. Even though it was primarily used for baseball, Cohen Stadium is also used for concerts, boxing, and soccer games. Starting in 2012, it will also be home to the El Paso Santos and Las Cruces Guerreros minor-league soccer teams. Both teams will play from February until April so as to not interfere with the Diablos' season. It replaced Dudley Field.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Cohen_Stadium.jpg/225px-Cohen_Stadium.jpg
