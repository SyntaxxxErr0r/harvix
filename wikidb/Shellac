101.4	Shellac	Shellac	Shellac is a resin secreted by the female lac bug, on trees in the forests of India and Thailand. It is processed and sold as dry flakes (pictured at right), which are dissolved in ethyl alcohol to make liquid shellac, which is used as a brush-on colorant, food glaze and wood finish. Shellac functions as a tough natural primer, sanding sealant, tannin-blocker, odour-blocker, stain, and high-gloss varnish. Shellac was once used in electrical applications as it possesses good insulation qualities and it seals out moisture. Phonograph records were also made of it during the pre-1950s, 78-rpm recording era.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Shellac_varities.png/220px-Shellac_varities.png
