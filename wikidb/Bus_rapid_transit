74.0	Bus_rapid_transit	Bus rapid transit	Bus rapid transit is a term applied to a variety of public transportation systems using buses to provide faster, more efficient service than an ordinary bus line. Often this is achieved by making improvements to existing infrastructure, vehicles and scheduling. The goal of these systems is to approach the service quality of rail transit while still enjoying the cost savings and flexibility of bus transit. The expression BRT is mainly used in the Americas; in Europe and Australia, it is often called a busway, while elsewhere, it may be called a quality bus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Ufprbus.jpg/300px-Ufprbus.jpg
