90.1	Microwave	Microwave	Microwaves are radio waves with wavelengths ranging from as long as one meter to as short as one millimeter, or equivalently, with frequencies between 300 MHz (0.3 GHz) and 300 GHz. This broad definition includes both UHF and EHF , and various sources use different boundaries. In all cases, microwave includes the entire SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum, with RF engineering often putting the lower boundary at 1 GHz (30 cm), and the upper around 100 GHz (3 mm).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Microwave_tower_silhouette.jpg/200px-Microwave_tower_silhouette.jpg
