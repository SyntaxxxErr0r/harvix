52.1	Electrostatic_discharge	Electrostatic discharge	Electrostatic discharge is a serious issue in solid state electronics, such as integrated circuits. Integrated circuits are made from semiconductor materials such as silicon and insulating materials such as silicon dioxide. Either of these materials can suffer permanent damage when subjected to high voltages; as a result, there are now a number of antistatic devices that help prevent static build up.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Thunder_rym.png/350px-Thunder_rym.png
