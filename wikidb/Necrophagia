The group was assembled in Wellsville, Ohio in 1983 and are credited as being one of the very first musical groups to be classified within the death metal genre. The group was founded by Frank Pucci. Their band name derives from the act of cannibalizing, or eating a corpse; the word is crafted from the two Greek words nekron (corpse) and phagein (to eat). Necrophagia is one of the earliest death metal bands, along with others such as Possessed, Master, Death and Morbid Angel, however, they are quite often overlooked.
