4.40	Misgurnus_anguillicaudatus	Misgurnus anguillicaudatus	The Dojo Loach , is a freshwater fish in the loach family Cobitidae. They are native to Asia but are also popular as an aquarium fish. The alternate name weather loach is shared with several other Cobitinae, including the other members of the genus Misgurnus and the spotted weather loach (Cobitis taenia, commonly known as Spined Loach). This term comes from their ability to detect changes in barometric pressure and react with frantic swimming or standing on end. This is because before a storm the barometric pressure changes, and this is known to make these fish more active. The weather loach also comes in a variety of colors, such as pink, orange, and gray.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Misgurnus_anguillicaudatus.jpg/220px-Misgurnus_anguillicaudatus.jpg
