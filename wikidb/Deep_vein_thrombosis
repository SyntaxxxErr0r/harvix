102.2	Deep_vein_thrombosis	Deep vein thrombosis	Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a deep vein, most commonly of the legs. A DVT can occur without symptoms, but in many cases the affected extremity will be painful, swollen, red, and warm, and the superficial veins may be engorged. The most serious complication of a DVT is that the clot could dislodge and travel to the lungs, which is called a pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT and PE are the two manifestations of the disease venous thromboembolism (VTE). Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate. Deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. A late complication of DVT is the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), which can manifest itself as edema, pain or discomfort and skin problems.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/DVT2010.JPG/230px-DVT2010.JPG
