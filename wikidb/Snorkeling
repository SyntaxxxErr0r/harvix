75.9	Snorkeling	Snorkeling	Snorkeling is the practice of swimming on or through a body of water while equipped with a diving mask, a shaped tube called a snorkel, and usually swimfins. In cooler waters, a wetsuit may also be worn. Use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe underwater attractions for extended periods of time with relatively little effort.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Reef_snorkeler.jpg/300px-Reef_snorkeler.jpg
