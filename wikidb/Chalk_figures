2.00	Chalk_figures	Hill figure	A hill figure is a large visual representation created by cutting into a steep hillside and revealing the underlying geology. It is a type of geoglyph usually designed to be seen from afar rather than above. In some cases trenches are dug and rubble made from material brighter than the natural bedrock is placed into them. The new material is often chalk, a soft and white form of limestone, leading to the alternative name of chalk figure for this form of art.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Long_Man_of_Wilmington.jpg/220px-Long_Man_of_Wilmington.jpg
