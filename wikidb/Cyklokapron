1.00	Cyklokapron	Tranexamic acid	Tranexamic acid (commonly marketed in tablet form as Lysteda and in IV form as Cyklokapron in the U.S. and Australia and as Transamin,Transcam in Asia, and Espercil in South America. Also marketed as Cyclo-F and Femstrual in UK.) is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine. It is used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss during surgery and in various other medical conditions. It is an antifibrinolytic that competitively inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, by binding to specific sites of both plasminogen and plasmin, a molecule responsible for the degradation of fibrin. Fibrin is a protein that forms the framework of blood clots. It has roughly 8 times the antifibrinolytic activity of an older analogue, Îµ-aminocaproic acid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Tranexamic_acid_Structural_Formulae.png/110px-Tranexamic_acid_Structural_Formulae.png
