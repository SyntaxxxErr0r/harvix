322.8	General_relativity	General relativity	General relativity or the general theory of relativity is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1916. It is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalises special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the four-momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Black_Hole_Milkyway.jpg/220px-Black_Hole_Milkyway.jpg
