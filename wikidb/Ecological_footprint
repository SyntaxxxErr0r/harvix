129.1	Ecological_footprint	Ecological footprint	The Swedish utility Vattenfall did a study of full life cycle emissions of Nuclear, Hydro, Coal, Gas, Solar Cell, Peat and Wind which the utility uses to produce electricity. The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3 grams of carbon dioxide per KW-Hr of produced power. This compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO2 of any of their electricity sources.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Human_welfare_and_ecological_footprint.jpg/400px-Human_welfare_and_ecological_footprint.jpg
