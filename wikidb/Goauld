3.10	Goauld	Goa'uld	The Goa'uld are a fictional symbiotic race of ancient astronauts from the American-Canadian military science fiction television franchise Stargate. The Goa'uld are parasites from the planet P3X-888, integrated within a host, most of the time a human. The resulting creatures are a powerful race bent on galactic conquest and domination, largely without pity, compassion or remorse. In the first eight seasons of Stargate SG-1 they are the greatest extraterrestrial threat to Earth known to the Stargate Command (SGC). The Goa'uld are the main enemies of SG-1 for most of the show, until they are replaced in this capacity by the Ori in seasons 9 and 10. They also appear in the Stargate Atlantis episode "Critical Mass", and in the DVD movie Stargate: Continuum. They are pejoratively called "snakes" or "snakeheads" by Jack O'Neill.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/Goa%27uld_in_water.jpg/200px-Goa%27uld_in_water.jpg
