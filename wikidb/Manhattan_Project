278.2	Manhattan_Project	Manhattan Project	The Manhattan Project was a research and development program, led by the United States with participation from the United Kingdom and Canada, that produced the first atomic bomb during World War II. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District; "Manhattan" gradually superseded the official codename, "Development of Substitute Materials", for the entire project. Along the way, the Manhattan Project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Trinity_shot_color.jpg/300px-Trinity_shot_color.jpg
