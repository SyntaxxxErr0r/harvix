6.30	Seraphs_(Battlestar_Galactica)	Seraphs (Battlestar Galactica)	The Ship of Lights is a Seraph spacecraft from the original Battlestar Galactica television series. It emits an extremely loud sound that can be heard by people in nearby spaceships and is sufficient to render humans unconscious. The Ship of Lights also carries smaller craft. In the re-imagined series, this vessel appears in a painting created by Starbuck. In addition, that series' Resurrection Ship restores characters to life, and in both series (Lieutenant Starbuck/Kara Thrace) is part of a resurrection-related plot that leads the characters toward Earth.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9b/Ship_of_Lights_from_Battlestar_Galactica_%281978_TV_series%29.jpg/250px-Ship_of_Lights_from_Battlestar_Galactica_%281978_TV_series%29.jpg
