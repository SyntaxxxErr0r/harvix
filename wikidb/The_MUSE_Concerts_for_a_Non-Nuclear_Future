1.00	The_MUSE_Concerts_for_a_Non-Nuclear_Future	Musicians United for Safe Energy	Musicians United for Safe Energy, or MUSE, is an activist group founded in 1979 by Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Bonnie Raitt, and John Hall. The group advocates against the use of nuclear energy, forming shortly after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in March 1979. MUSE organized a series of five No Nukes concerts held at Madison Square Garden in New York in September 1979. On September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a large rally staged by MUSE on the then-empty north end of the Battery Park City landfill in New York.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Smiling_Sun_-_English.jpg/220px-Smiling_Sun_-_English.jpg
