1.00	Yeoman_Plotter	Yeoman plotter	The Yeoman Plotter is a plotter used on ships and boats, which allows GPS and radar navigation data to be used much more effectively with traditional paper charts. It is a unique piece of navigational aid in that it allows the navigation with electronic aids, and also allows the continued navigation when the electronics fail (by using the maps and manual plotting instead).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/60/Yacht_chart_table.jpg/220px-Yacht_chart_table.jpg
