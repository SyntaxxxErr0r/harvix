3.00	Overland_Route_(Union_Pacific_Railroad)	Overland Route (Union Pacific Railroad)	The Overland Route was a train route operated jointly by the Union Pacific Railroad and the Central Pacific Railroad / Southern Pacific Railroad, between Council Bluffs, Iowa / Omaha, Nebraska, and San Francisco, California over the grade of the First Transcontinental Railroad (aka the "Pacific Railroad") which had been opened on May 10, 1869. Passenger trains that operated over the line included the Overland Flyer, later renamed the Overland Limited, which also included a connection to Chicago. Although the passenger rail service is no longer in operation, the Overland Route remains a common name for the line from California to Chicago, now owned entirely by the Union Pacific.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Overland_Limited.jpg/220px-Overland_Limited.jpg
