54.4	Aerospace_engineering	Aerospace engineering	Aerospace engineering is the primary branch of engineering concerned with the design, construction, and science of aircraft and spacecraft. It is divided into two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. The former deals with craft that stay within Earth's atmosphere, and the latter with craft that operate outside it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Apollo_13_Mailbox_at_Mission_Control.jpg/300px-Apollo_13_Mailbox_at_Mission_Control.jpg
