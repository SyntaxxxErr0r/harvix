65.9	Solution	Solution	In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of only one phase. In such a mixture, a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent. The solvent does the dissolving. The solution more or less takes on the characteristics of the solvent including its phase, and the solvent is commonly the major fraction of the mixture. The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of how much of that solute is dissolved in the solvent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/SaltInWaterSolutionLiquid.jpg/220px-SaltInWaterSolutionLiquid.jpg
