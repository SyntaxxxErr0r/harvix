7.10	Randall_Made_Knives	Randall Made Knives	Randall Made Knives, usually referred to as Randall, is an American manufacturer specializing in custom handcrafted knives founded by Walter Doane "Bo" Randall, Jr. The factory and showroom is located in Orlando, Florida. Randall offers 28 models of knives for different applications, each customizable at the factory based on customer specification. Randall hand forges nearly all models of knives instead of factory stamping, one of few manufacturers to do so. Randall uses a 17-step process for making knives, which usually takes over 8 hours to complete. The waiting list for obtaining a Randall from the factory is typically five years.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Randall_Made_Knives_building_001_crop.jpg/250px-Randall_Made_Knives_building_001_crop.jpg
