64.5	Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe	Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe	The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe , is a memorial in Berlin to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, designed by architect Peter Eisenman and engineer Buro Happold. It consists of a 19,000 square metres (4.7 acres) site covered with 2,711 concrete slabs or "stelae", arranged in a grid pattern on a sloping field. The stelae are 2.38 m (7 ft 10 in) long, 0.95 m (3 ft 1 in) wide and vary in height from 0.2 to 4.8 m (8 in to 15 ft 9 in). According to Eisenman's project text, the stelae are designed to produce an uneasy, confusing atmosphere, and the whole sculpture aims to represent a supposedly ordered system that has lost touch with human reason. A 2005 copy of the Foundation for the Memorial's official English tourist pamphlet, however, states that the design represents a radical approach to the traditional concept of a memorial, partly because Eisenman did not use any symbolism. An attached underground "Place of Information" (German: ) holds the names of all known Jewish Holocaust victims, obtained from the Israeli museum Yad Vashem.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Memorial_to_the_murdered_Jews_of_Europe.jpg/200px-Memorial_to_the_murdered_Jews_of_Europe.jpg
