The standard depiction of the character first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, written c. 1136, and is based on an amalgamation of previous historical and legendary figures. Geoffrey combined existing stories of Myrddin Wyllt (Merlinus Caledonensis), a North Brythonic prophet and madman with no connection to King Arthur, with tales of the Romano-British war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus to form the composite figure he called Merlin Ambrosius (Welsh: ).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Merlin_%28illustration_from_middle_ages%29.jpg/225px-Merlin_%28illustration_from_middle_ages%29.jpg
