6.33	Patch_test_(medicine)	Patch test (medicine)	Eczema can be produced by exogenous factors and is referred to as exogenous or contact dermatitis. There are two forms of contact eczema: irritant and allergic. Irritant dermatitis occurs after chronic exposure to mild irritants (e.g. soaps, detergents in a wet environment). "Handwashing" eczema is an example of irritant dermatitis produced by chronic exposure to soaps and detergents since rarely these products produce allergic reactions. Allergic contact dermatitis, on the other hand, is the manifestation of an acquired allergic response to chemicals that normally do not produce irritant and toxic effects. Since allergic contact dermatitis occur in a small percentage of the population, one individual might be the only one affected in the environment, even though other people are also exposed to the chemical(s). To develop an allergic reactions there had to be previous exposure(s) to the incriminated chemical(s). The longer one is exposed to some of these chemicals, the greater the chances of becoming allergic, and once one become allergic, subsequent exposure will be followed by more severe eczematous reactions. In the case of allergic contact dermatitis, high concentrations or prolonged exposure to the chemicals are not prerequisite to induce a reaction as is the case with an irritant contact dermatitis. In other words, casual exposure to the chemical(s) could be sufficient to induce a skin reaction if you have an allergic contact dermatitis. A patch test is a method used to determine if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. Any individual with eczema suspected of having allergic contact dermatitis and/or atopic dermatitis needs patch testing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Epikutanni-test.jpg/230px-Epikutanni-test.jpg
