55.7	Hope	Hope	Hope is the emotional state, the opposite of which is despair, which promotes the belief in a positive outcome related to events and circumstances in one's life. It is the "feeling that what is wanted can be had or that events will turn out for the best" or the act of "look forward to with desire and reasonable confidence" or "feel that something desired may happen". Other definitions are "to cherish a desire with anticipation"; "to desire with expectation of obtainment"; or "to expect with confidence". In the English language the word can be used as either a noun or a verb, although hope as a concept has a similar meaning in either use.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Francesco_Guardi_002.jpg/220px-Francesco_Guardi_002.jpg
