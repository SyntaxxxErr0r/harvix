4.00	Heavy_lift	Heavy lift	The transportation, handling and installation of heavy items which are indivisible, and of weights generally accepted to be in the range of 1 ton to over 1000 tons and of widths/heights of more than 100 meters that are too large to fit into normal containers or onto conventional transporters. These oversized items are transported from one place to another (sometimes across country borders) then lifted or installed into place. Characteristic for heavy lift goods is the absence of standardization which requires an individual transport planning.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/MV_Blue_Marlin_carrying_USS_Cole.jpg/200px-MV_Blue_Marlin_carrying_USS_Cole.jpg
