3.00	Saint_Brigid's,_Ottawa	Saint Brigid's Church (Ottawa)	St Brigid's was Roman Catholic church located in the Lower Town neighbourhood of Ottawa, Canada. It was built to serve the English-speaking, Catholic population of the area. Until the opening of St Brigidâ€™s, this community, largely of Irish heritage, had formed part of the parish of Notre-Dame, the Cathedral of Ottawa. By 1870, the Irish percentage of the population had declined relative to that of the French Canadian. As a consequence, the Irish played an ever diminishing role in the life and management of Notre-Dame.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/St_Brigid%27s_Church_%28Ottawa%29.JPG/250px-St_Brigid%27s_Church_%28Ottawa%29.JPG
