196.4	Source_code	Source code	In computer science, source code is any collection of computer instructions (possibly with comments) written using some human-readable computer language, usually as text. The source code of a programming language is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is automatically translated at some point to machine code that the computer can directly read and execute. An interpreter translates to machine code and executes it on the fly when the program is run, while a compiler translates the program in advance to machine code that it stores as executable files; these can then be executed as a separate step.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/CodeCmmt002.svg/300px-CodeCmmt002.svg.png
