1.00	Isaac_Oluwole	Isaac Oluwole	Isaac Oluwole (1852â€“1932) was a Nigerian bishop of Sierra Leonean and Egba heritage. He was one of the most prominent emigrants from Sierra Leone resident in Lagos during the second half of the nineteenth century. From 1879-1893, he was the principal of the CMS Grammar School, Lagos and was later ordained a priest. During his time, he was one of the most loved among his peers of clergymen. A reason which may have led to his recommendation as a bishop after a leading radical candidate, James Johnson, complained about the neglect of indigenous control of the Church of Missionary Society.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/The_Mission_at_Lagos_1885.png/300px-The_Mission_at_Lagos_1885.png
