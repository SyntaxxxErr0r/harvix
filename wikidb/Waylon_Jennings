63.7	Waylon_Jennings	Waylon Jennings	Waylon Arnold Jennings (June 15, 1937 â€“ February 13, 2002) was an American country music singer, songwriter, and musician. Jennings began playing guitar at eight and began performing at twelve on KVOW radio. Jennings formed a band The Texas Longhorns. Jennings worked as a D.J on KVOW, KDAV, KYTI and KLLL. In 1958, Buddy Holly arranged Jennings' first recording session, of "Jolie Blon" and "When Sin Stops (Love Begins)". Holly hired Jennings to play bass. Jennings unintentionally missed flying with Holly, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens on the flight which they died. Before takeoff, Holly, in jest, told Jennings "I hope your ol' bus freezes up", to which Jennings, also in jest, responded with "I hope your ol' plane crashes". These words would haunt Jennings his entire life.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Waylon_Jennings_RCA_cropped.jpg/220px-Waylon_Jennings_RCA_cropped.jpg
