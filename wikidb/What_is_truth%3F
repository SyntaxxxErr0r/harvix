2.10	What_is_truth%3F	John 18:38	The exact intention of Pilate has been subject to debate among scholars, with no firm conclusion. His statement may have been made in jest that the trial was a mockery, or he may have actually intended to reflect on the philosophical position that truth is hard to understand. However, regardless of his exact intention in uttering the statement, his action was to ignore the assertion of Jesus that he was the "witness to truth".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/IQueEsLaVerita.jpg/300px-IQueEsLaVerita.jpg
