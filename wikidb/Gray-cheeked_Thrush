1.30	Gray-cheeked_Thrush	Grey-cheeked Thrush	The Grey-cheeked Thrush, Catharus minimus, is a medium-sized thrush. This species is 15â€“17 cm in length, and has the white-dark-white underwing pattern characteristic of Catharus thrushes. It is a member of a close-knit group of migrant species together with the Veery and Bicknell's Thrush (Winker &amp; Pruett, 2006); it forms a cryptic species pair with the latter. The Grey-cheeked Thrush is all but indistinguishable from Bicknell's Thrush except by its slightly larger size and different song. The two were formerly considered conspecific.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Graycheekedthrush36.jpg/220px-Graycheekedthrush36.jpg
