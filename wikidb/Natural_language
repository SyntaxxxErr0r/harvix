66.5	Natural_language	Natural language	In the philosophy of language, a natural language (or ordinary language) is any language which arises in an unpremeditated fashion as the result of the innate facility for language possessed by the human intellect. A natural language is typically used for communication, and may be spoken, signed, or written. Natural language is distinguished from constructed languages and formal languages such as computer-programming languages or the "languages" used in the study of formal logic, especially mathematical logic.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Linguistic_diversity.png/350px-Linguistic_diversity.png
