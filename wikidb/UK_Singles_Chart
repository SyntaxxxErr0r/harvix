89.7	UK_Singles_Chart	UK Singles Chart	The UK Singles Chart is compiled by The Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf of the British record industry. The full chart contains the weekly top-selling 200 single recordings in the United Kingdom, based upon combined record sales and download numbers. However, some media outlets only list the Top 40 (such as the BBC) or the Top 75 (such as Music Week magazine) of this list. Around 6,500 British retail outlets contribute sales data, as well as most UK online digital-download stores. Unlike charts in the United States, no airplay statistics are used for the official UK Singles Chart. The chart week runs from 00:01 Sunday to midnight Saturday, with most UK digital singles being released on Sundays (followed by CD releases on Monday).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Official_Singles_Chart_logo.jpg/220px-Official_Singles_Chart_logo.jpg
