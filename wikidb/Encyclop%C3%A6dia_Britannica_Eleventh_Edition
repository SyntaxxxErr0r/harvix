58.8	Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition	Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition	The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1910–1911) is a 29-volume reference work, an edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. It was developed during the encyclopaedia's transition from a British to an American publication. Some of its articles were written by the best-known scholars of the time. This edition of the encyclopedia is now in the public domain, but the outdated nature of some of its content makes its use as a source for modern scholarship problematic. Some articles have special value and interest to modern scholars as cultural artifacts of the 19th and early 20th centuries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Encyclopaedia_Britannica_1911.svg/300px-Encyclopaedia_Britannica_1911.svg.png
