56.9	Food_processing	Food processing	Food processing is the set of methods and techniques used to transform raw ingredients into food or to transform food into other forms for consumption by humans or animals either in the home or by the food processing industry. Food processing typically takes clean, harvested crops or butchered animal products and uses these to produce attractive, marketable and often long shelf-life food products. Similar processes are used to produce animal feed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Production_of_cheese_1.jpg/300px-Production_of_cheese_1.jpg
