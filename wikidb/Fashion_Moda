10.13	Fashion_Moda	Fashion Moda	Fashion Moda was founded in 1978 by Stefan Eins. He was soon joined by artist Joe Lewis and William Scott, a young teenager from the neighborhood as co-directors. Defining itself as a concept, Fashion Moda quickly became a strong voice in the New York art world during the late 1970s and the 1980s. Fashion Moda crossed boundaries and mixed metaphors. It helped redefine the function of art in a post-modernist society. Fashion Moda spotlighted such artists as David Wojnarowicz, Keith Haring, Stefan Roloff, Jenny Holzer, Mark Kostabi, Kenny Scharf, Joe Lewis, John Ahearn, Lisa Kahane, John Fekner, Don Leicht, Jacek Tylicki, Stefan Eins himself and graffiti artists like Richard Hambleton, Koor, Daze, Crash, Spank, and many others. In addition to highlighting new talent, Fashion Moda was a major force in establishing new venues. In 1980, Fashion Moda collaborated with the downtown progressive artists organisation Colab (Collaborative Projects Inc.) on "The Times Square Show" (June 1980), and Now Gallery which introduced uptown graffiti-related art to downtown art and punk scenes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Fashionmoda1981.jpg/280px-Fashionmoda1981.jpg
