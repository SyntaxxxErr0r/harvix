1.00	Grapes_of_Wrath_(band)	The Grapes of Wrath (band)	The Grapes of Wrath are a Canadian folk rock band, who were one of Canada's most successful pop bands in the late 1980s and early 1990s before disbanding in 1992. With the band name tied up in litigation, most of the band continued to record through the 1990s as Ginger. The Grapes of Wrath briefly reunited for one album in 2000, although not with their full original lineup. This same version of the band reunited again in 2009, and the original three members reunited in July 2010. They have gone on to play several concerts in various Canadian cities, and are once again active as a group.
