27.21	Hypovitaminosis_D	Hypovitaminosis D	Hypovitaminosis D is a deficiency of vitamin D. It can result from inadequate nutritional intake of vitamin D coupled with inadequate sunlight exposure (in particular sunlight with adequate ultra violet B rays), disorders that limit vitamin D absorption, and conditions that impair the conversion of vitamin D into active metabolites including certain liver, kidney, and hereditary disorders. Deficiency results in impaired bone mineralization and leads to bone softening diseases including rickets in children and osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/VitaminD_levels_and_bone_diseases.svg/300px-VitaminD_levels_and_bone_diseases.svg.png
