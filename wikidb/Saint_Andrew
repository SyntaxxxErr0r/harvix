97.8	Saint_Andrew	Saint Andrew	Saint Andrew , called in the Orthodox tradition Prōtoklētos, or the First-called, is a Christian Apostle and the brother of Saint Peter. The name "Andrew" (Greek: manly, brave, from ἀνδρεία, Andreia, "manhood, valour"), like other Greek names, appears to have been common among the Jews, Christians, and other Hellenized peoples of the region. No Hebrew or Aramaic name is recorded for him. He is considered the founder and the first bishop of the Church of Byzantium and is consequently the patron saint of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/St_Andrew_the_Apostle_-_Bulgarian_icon.jpg/180px-St_Andrew_the_Apostle_-_Bulgarian_icon.jpg
