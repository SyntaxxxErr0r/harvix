53.5	Thermoelectric_effect	Thermoelectric effect	The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice-versa. A thermoelectric device creates a voltage when there is a different temperature on each side. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, it creates a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature gradient causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side, similar to a classical gas that expands when heated; hence inducing a thermal current.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Peltierelement_16x16.jpg/220px-Peltierelement_16x16.jpg
