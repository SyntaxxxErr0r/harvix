A typical example is FasR, which forms the DISC upon trimerization as a result of its ligand binding. Dogma states that the DISC is composed of the death receptor, FADD, and caspase 8. It transduces a downstream signal cascade resulting in apoptosis.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Fas_signaling.jpg/500px-Fas_signaling.jpg
