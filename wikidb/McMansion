97.1	McMansion	McMansion	In American suburban communities, McMansion is a pejorative term for a type of large, new luxury house which is judged to be pretentious, tasteless, or — especially — incongruous for its neighborhood. Alternately, a McMansion can be a large, new house in a sub-division of similarly large houses, which all seem mass produced and lacking distinguishing characteristics, as well as at variance with the traditional local architecture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Mcmansion_under_construction.jpg/250px-Mcmansion_under_construction.jpg
