78.6	Fyodor_Dostoevsky	Fyodor Dostoyevsky	Dostoyevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social and spiritual context of 19th-century Russian society. With the embittered voice of the anonymous "underground man", Dostoyevsky wrote Notes from Underground (1864), which has been called the "best overture for existentialism ever written" by Walter Kaufmann. He is often acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest and most prominent psychologists in world literature.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Dostoevskij_1876.jpg/220px-Dostoevskij_1876.jpg
