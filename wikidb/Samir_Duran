2.00	Samir_Duran	Characters of StarCraft	The characters and story of the StarCraft series were created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney. However, as Phinney was not involved in StarCraft: Brood War, Chris Metzen alone is credited for the development of the plot in the expansion. Despite the series' success globally, particularly in South Korea, Blizzard Entertainment has not made any major comments regarding the development of the characters and the storyline of the StarCraft series.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e5/Over_Reverent_%28StarCraft%29.jpg/170px-Over_Reverent_%28StarCraft%29.jpg
