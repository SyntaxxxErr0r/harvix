34.34	Francisco_I._Madero	Francisco I. Madero	Francisco Indalecio Madero González (30 October 1873 –21 February 1913) was a politician, writer and revolutionary who served as President of Mexico from 1911 to 1913. As a respectable upper-class politician, he supplied a center around which opposition to the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz could coalesce. However, once Díaz was deposed, Madero proved to be ineffective, and the Mexican Revolution quickly spun out of his control. He was deposed and executed by the Porfirista military and his aides, which he had neglected to replace with revolutionary supporters. His assassination was followed by the most violent period of the revolution in Mexico (1913–1917), lasting until the Constitution of 1917 and revolutionary president Venustiano Carranza achieved some degree of stability. Followers of Madero were known as Maderistas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Francisco_I_Madero.jpg/220px-Francisco_I_Madero.jpg
