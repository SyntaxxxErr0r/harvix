103.2	Adoption	Adoption	Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting for another and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities from the original parent or parents. Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption whereas others have endeavored to achieve adoption through less formal means, notably via contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities. Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Children_at_New_York_Foundling_cph.3a23917.jpg/250px-Children_at_New_York_Foundling_cph.3a23917.jpg
