64.6	Mangosteen	Purple mangosteen	The purple mangosteen , colloquially known simply as mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree believed to have originated in the Sunda Islands and the Moluccas of Indonesia. The tree grows from 7 to 25 m (20â€“80 ft) tall. The fruit of the mangosteen is sweet and tangy, juicy, and somewhat fibrous, with an inedible, deep reddish purple-colored rind (exocarp) when ripe. In each fruit, the fragrant edible flesh that surrounds each seed is botanically endocarp, i.e., the inner layer of the ovary.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Berthe_Hoola_van_Nooten48.jpg/220px-Berthe_Hoola_van_Nooten48.jpg
