187.1	Keith_Richards	Keith Richards	Keith Richards (born 18 December 1943) is an English musician, songwriter, and founder member of The Rolling Stones. Rolling Stone magazine said Richards has created "rock's greatest single body of riffs", and has named him the 10th greatest guitarist of all time. Fourteen songs written by Richards and songwriting partner Mick Jagger, The Rolling Stones' lead vocalist, are listed among Rolling Stone magazine's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time". Richards' notoriety for illicit drug use stems in part from several drug busts during the late 1960s and 1970s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Keith_RichardsCLOSE_UP.jpg/220px-Keith_RichardsCLOSE_UP.jpg
