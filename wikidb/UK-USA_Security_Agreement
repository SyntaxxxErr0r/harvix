4.61	UK-USA_Security_Agreement	UKUSA Agreement	The United Kingdom â€“ United States of America Agreement is a multilateral agreement for cooperation in signals intelligence among the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It was first signed in March 1946 by the United Kingdom and the United States and later extended to encompass the three former British dominions. The UKUSA Agreement was a follow-up of the 1943 BRUSA Agreement, the World War II agreement on cooperation over intelligence matters. This was a secret treaty, allegedly so secret that it was kept secret from the Australian Prime Ministers until 1973.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/UKUSA_Map.svg/220px-UKUSA_Map.svg.png
