1.30	Act_a_Fool_(album)	Act a Fool (album)	Act a Fool is the debut album by West Coast hip hop artist King Tee. It is considered to be one of his better albums. Its success can be attributed to its production which is handled by DJ Pooh and King Tee himself, or the lack of guest appearances. King Tee is the only vocalist on the entire albumâ€”aside from Breeze and Mixmaster Spade on "Just Clowning--and his rhymes are described as " efiant, angry, confrontational, and bemused" by Ron Wynn of Allmusic. Act a Fool reached Billboard 200 chart position (#125). Its title track reached #29 on the Hot Rap Singles chart, and "Bass", which is remixed on this album, reached #19 on the same chart.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Actafoolkingtee.jpg/220px-Actafoolkingtee.jpg
