1.00	Xukpi	Copán	Copán is an archaeological site of the Maya civilization located in the Copán Department of western Honduras, not far from the border with Guatemala. It was the capital city of a major Classic period kingdom from the 5th to 9th centuries AD. The city was located in the extreme southeast of the Mesoamerican cultural region, on the frontier with the Isthmo-Colombian cultural region, and was almost surrounded by non-Maya peoples. In this fertile valley now lies a city of about 3000, a small airport, and a winding road.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Copan_sculpture.jpg/300px-Copan_sculpture.jpg
