2.00	Postural_Tachycardia_Syndrome	Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome	Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is a condition of dysautonomia, to be more specific orthostatic intolerance, in which a change from the supine position to an upright position causes an abnormally large increase in heart rate, called tachycardia. Several studies show a decrease in cerebral blood flow with systolic and diastolic cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity decreased 44% and 60%, respectively. Patients with POTS have problems maintaining homeostasis when changing position, i.e. moving from one chair to another or reaching above their heads. Many patients also experience symptoms when stationary or even while lying down.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Propranolol_80mg.png/220px-Propranolol_80mg.png
