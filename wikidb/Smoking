79.1	Smoking	Smoking	Smoking is a practice in which a substance, most commonly tobacco and/or cannabis, is burned and the smoke is tasted or inhaled. This is primarily practised as a route of administration for recreational drug use, as combustion releases the active substances in drugs such as nicotine and makes them available for absorption through the lungs. It can also be done as a part of rituals, to induce trances and spiritual enlightenment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Aztec_feast_1.jpg/220px-Aztec_feast_1.jpg
