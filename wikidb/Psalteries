1.00	Psalteries	Psaltery	A psaltery is a stringed musical instrument of the harp or the zither family. The psaltery of Ancient Greece dates from at least 2800 BC, and was a harp-like instrument. The word psaltery derives from the Ancient Greek ψαλτήριον (psaltērion), "stringed instrument, psaltery, harp" and that from the verb ψάλλω (psallō), "to touch sharply, to pluck, pull, twitch" and in the case of the strings of musical instruments, "to play a stringed instrument with the fingers, and not with the plectron."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Psalterion_001.jpg/200px-Psalterion_001.jpg
