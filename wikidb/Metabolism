162.5	Metabolism	Metabolism	Metabolism (from Greek: "metabolÄ“", "change" or Greek: metabolismos, "outthrow") is the set of chemical reactions that happen in the cells of living organisms to sustain life. These processes allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word metabolism can also refer to all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells, in which case the set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/ATP-3D-vdW.png/220px-ATP-3D-vdW.png
