57.7	Business_cycle	Business cycle	The term business cycle (or economic cycle) refers to economy-wide fluctuations in production or economic activity over several months or years. These fluctuations occur around a long-term growth trend, and typically involve shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid economic growth (an expansion or boom), and periods of relative stagnation or decline (a contraction or recession).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png
