56.8	Kingston_Fossil_Plant_coal_fly_ash_slurry_spill	Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill	The TVA Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill occurred just before 1 a.m. on Monday December 22, 2008, when an ash dike ruptured at an 84-acre (0.34 km2) solid waste containment area at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant in Roane County, Tennessee, USA. 1.1 billion US gallons (4,200,000 m3) of coal fly ash slurry was released. The coal-fired power plant, located across the Clinch River from the city of Kingston, uses ponds to dewater the fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion, which is then stored in wet form in dredge cells. The slurry (a mixture of fly ash and water) traveled across the Emory River and its Swan Pond embayment, on to the opposite shore, covering up to 300 acres (1.2 km2) of the surrounding land, damaging homes and flowing up and down stream in nearby waterways such as the Emory River and Clinch River (tributaries of the Tennessee River). It was the largest fly ash release in United States history.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Aerial_view_of_ash_slide_site_Dec_23_2008_TVA.gov_123002.jpg/325px-Aerial_view_of_ash_slide_site_Dec_23_2008_TVA.gov_123002.jpg
