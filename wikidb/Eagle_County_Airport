1.00	Eagle_County_Airport	Eagle County Regional Airport	Eagle County Regional Airport , sometimes referred to as Vail/Eagle Airport or the Eagle Vail Airport, is a public airport located four miles (6 km) west of Eagle, Colorado, United States. The airport serves its namesake Eagle County, which includes visitors to the nearby Vail and Beaver Creek ski resorts. It covers 632 acres (256 ha) and is configured with a single runway. The History Channel rated Eagle County Regional Airport as #8 on its list of Most Extreme Airports in July 2010 due to the altitude, weather variability, an approach through mountainous terrain and challenging departure procedures. In 2008-2009, the airport finished its runway repaving and extension which brought the runway up to 9,000 feet. This enables planes to take off with more weight.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Eagle_County_Airport_terminal.jpg/200px-Eagle_County_Airport_terminal.jpg
