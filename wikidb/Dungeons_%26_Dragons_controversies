Especially during the 1980s, certain religious groups accused the game of encouraging interest in sorcery and the veneration of demons. Throughout the history of roleplaying games, many of these criticisms have been aimed specifically at Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but touch on the genre of fantasy roleplaying games as a whole.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Occult_dnd.png/300px-Occult_dnd.png
