3.00	Oxford_Bookstore	Oxford Bookstore	The Oxford Bookstore formerly known as Oxford Bookstore and Stationery Company is an Indian book store-chain established in 1920 by the Primlani family, a Sindhi business house who were pioneers in book wholesaling in India. It has no connection with Oxford University Press. Its outlets, on prime locations in the high streets of most of the major cities of the Raj such as Delhi, Mumbai, Meerut, Chennai (2006) and Calcutta, are well known even today. Still known as the 'Oxford Bookstores, the outlets are now managed by the Apeejay Surrendra Group, a Calcutta-based conglomerate, while the book wholesaling business has been merged with India Book House to become Oxford and IBH.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Oxford_bookstore.jpg/180px-Oxford_bookstore.jpg
