115.7	On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you're_a_dog	On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog	"On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog" is an adage which began as the caption of a cartoon by Peter Steiner published by The New Yorker on July 5, 1993. The cartoon features two dogs: one sitting on a chair in front of a computer, speaking the caption to a second dog sitting on the floor. As of 2000 , the panel was the most reproduced cartoon from The New Yorker, and Steiner has earned over US $50,000 from its reprinting.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Internet_dog.jpg/220px-Internet_dog.jpg
