3.00	Model_Products_Corporation	Model Products Corporation	In the early 1970s, MPC also ventured into caricature model creations similar to Revell's Ed Roth 'Ratfink' based custom car kits or Bill Campbell's Weird-Ohs made by Hawk Models. MPC's versions were called 'Zingers', and featured comical stubby and swollen looking vehicles with huge drag engines. Some examples were a 1965 Dodge van, a VW transporter bus, a VW bug, a Dune Buggy and a Corvette - but these were different compared to Aurora models because they didn't feature strange people or animals. The Zinger line was reintroduced in 2009 as Round 2 LLC took MPC into its growing stable of venerable kit makers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/MPCHoganJeep.jpg/300px-MPCHoganJeep.jpg
