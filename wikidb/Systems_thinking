In nature, systems thinking examples include ecosystems in which various elements such as air, water, movement, plants, and animals work together to survive or perish. In organizations, systems consist of people, structures, and processes that work together to make an organization healthy or unhealthy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg/240px-Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg.png
