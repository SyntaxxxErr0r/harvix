62.6	State_(polity)	State (polity)	A state is an organized political community, living under a government. States may be sovereign. Many states are federated states which participate in a federal union. Some states are subject to external sovereignty or hegemony where ultimate sovereignty lies in another state. The state can also be used to refer to the secular branches of government within a state, often as a manner of contrasting them with churches and civilian institutions (civil society).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Leviathan_gr.jpg/250px-Leviathan_gr.jpg
