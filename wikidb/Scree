61.2	Scree	Scree	Scree, or talus, is accumulation of broken rock fragments at the base of crags, mountain cliffs, or valley shoulders. Landforms associated with these materials are sometimes called scree slopes or talus piles. These deposits typically have a concave upwards form, while the maximum inclination of such deposits corresponds to the angle of repose of the mean debris size.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Yamnuska_bottom_cliff.jpg/220px-Yamnuska_bottom_cliff.jpg
