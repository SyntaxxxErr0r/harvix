20.41	Turkish_Cypriots	Turkish Cypriots	Turkish Cypriots (Turkish: Greek: ) are the ethnic Turks and members of the Turkish-speaking ethnolinguistic community of the Eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus. The term is used to refer explicitly to the indigenous Turkish Cypriots, whose Ottoman Turkish forbears colonised the island in 1571. About 30,000 Turkish soldiers were given land once they settled in Cyprus, which bequeathed a significant Turkish community; today's Turkish Cypriots.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Famous_Turkish_Cypriot_people.png/300px-Famous_Turkish_Cypriot_people.png
