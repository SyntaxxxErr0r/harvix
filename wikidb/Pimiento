7.21	Pimiento	Pimento	A pimento or cherry pepper is a variety of large, red, heart-shaped chili pepper that measures 3 to 4 inches (7 to 10 cm) long and 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) wide (medium, elongate). The flesh of the pimento is sweet, succulent and more aromatic than that of the red bell pepper. Some varieties of the pimento type are hot, including the Floral Gem and Santa Fe Grande varieties. "Pimiento" is the Spanish word. "Pimento" or "piment√£o" are Portuguese words for "bell pepper", while "pimenta" refers both to chili peppers and to black peppercorns. It is typically used fresh, or pickled and jarred. The pimento has one of the lowest Scoville scale ratings of any chili pepper.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Cherrypeppers.jpg/220px-Cherrypeppers.jpg
