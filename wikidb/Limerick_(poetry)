79.3	Limerick_(poetry)	Limerick (poetry)	The limerick form was popularized by Edward Lear in his first Book of Nonsense (1845) and a later work (1872) on the same theme. Lear wrote 212 limericks, mostly nonsense verse. It was customary at the time for limericks to accompany an absurd illustration of the same subject, and for the final line of the limerick to be a kind of conclusion, usually a variant of the first line ending in the same word.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg/220px-1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg
