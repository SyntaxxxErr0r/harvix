4.01	Geographic_routing	Geographic routing	Greedy forwarding can lead into a dead end, where there is no neighbor closer to the destination. Then, face routing helps to recover from that situation and find a path to another node, where greedy forwarding can be resumed. A recovery strategy such as face routing is necessary to assure that a message can be delivered to the destination. The combination of greedy forwarding and face routing was first proposed in 1999 under the name GFG (Greedy-Face-Greedy). It guarantees delivery in the so-called unit disk graph network model. Various variants, which were proposed later, also for non-unit disk graphs, are based on the principles of GFG .	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f7/Georouting_greedy_variants.svg/309px-Georouting_greedy_variants.svg.png
