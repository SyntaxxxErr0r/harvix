2.10	Heinrich_Neumann_von_H%C3%A9th%C3%A1rs	Heinrich Neumann von Héthárs	Heinrich Neumann von Héthárs (from 1913 to 1919 Heinrich Neumann Ritter von Héthárs; 10 June 1873 Héthárs , then Hungary, now Slovakia - 6 November 1939 New York City) was the foremost ear-nose-and-throat doctor in Vienna before World War II. In 1938 he transmitted to the Evian Conference the infamous offer by the German government to sell the Austrian Jews at a price of $250 per capita to any foreign country that would accept them and pay. This offer - and the Conference delegates' refusal to accept it - is the focal point of Hans Habe's novel The Mission (1965).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Heinrich_Neumann_von_H%C3%A9th%C3%A1rs.jpg/220px-Heinrich_Neumann_von_H%C3%A9th%C3%A1rs.jpg
