145.5	Debt	Debt	A debt is an obligation owed by one party (the debtor) to a second party, the creditor; usually this refers to assets granted by the creditor to the debtor, but the term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on economic value.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Smartcard2.png/140px-Smartcard2.png
