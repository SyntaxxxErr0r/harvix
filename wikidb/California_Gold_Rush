248.3	California_Gold_Rush	California Gold Rush	The California Gold Rush (1848â€“1855) began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The first to hear confirmed information of the gold rush were the people in Oregon, the Sandwich Islands , and Latin America, who were the first to start flocking to the state in late 1848. All in all, the news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. Of the 300,000, approximately half arrived by sea and half came from the east overland on the California Trail and the Gila River trail.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/California_Clipper_500.jpg/330px-California_Clipper_500.jpg
