140.7	Emotion	Emotion	Emotion is a complex psychophysiological experience of an individual's state of mind as interacting with biochemical (internal) and environmental (external) influences. In humans, emotion fundamentally involves "physiological arousal, expressive behaviors, and conscious experience." Emotion is associated with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation. Motivations direct and energize behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Emotions.gif/220px-Emotions.gif
