152.5	Auld_Lang_Syne	Auld Lang Syne	"Auld Lang Syne" (Scots pronunciation: : note "s" rather than "z") is a Scots poem written by Robert Burns in 1788 and set to the tune of a traditional folk song (Roud # 6294). It is well known in many countries, especially in the English-speaking world; its traditional use being to celebrate the start of the New Year at the stroke of midnight. By extension, it is also sung at funerals, graduations and as a farewell or ending to other occasions. The international Boy Scout youth movement, in many countries, uses it as a close to jamborees and other functions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Robert_burns.jpg/100px-Robert_burns.jpg
