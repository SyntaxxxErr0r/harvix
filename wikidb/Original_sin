78.6	Original_sin	Original sin	Original sin is, according to a Christian theological doctrine, humanity's state of sin resulting from the Fall of Man. This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a "sin nature", to something as drastic as total depravity or automatic guilt of all humans through collective guilt.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Michelangelo_Buonarroti_022.jpg/300px-Michelangelo_Buonarroti_022.jpg
