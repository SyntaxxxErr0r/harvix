55.4	Forestry	Forestry	Forestry is the interdisciplinary profession embracing the science, art, and craft of creating, managing, using, and conserving forests and associated resources in a sustainable manner to meet desired goals, needs, and values for human benefit. Forestry is practiced in plantations and natural stands. The main goal of forestry is to create and implement systems that allow forests to continue a sustainable provision of environmental supplies and services. The challenge of forestry is to create systems that are socially accepted while sustaining the resource and any other resources that might be affected.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Forstarbeiten_in_%C3%96sterreich.JPG/220px-Forstarbeiten_in_%C3%96sterreich.JPG
