76.9	Father	Father	A father (or dad) is defined as a male parent of any type of offspring. The adjective "paternal" refers to father, parallel to "maternal" for mother. The verb "to father" means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the gerund "fathering". Fathers determine the gender of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome (male).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Father_and_son_27.jpg/250px-Father_and_son_27.jpg
