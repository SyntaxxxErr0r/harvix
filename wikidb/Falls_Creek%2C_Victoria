3.00	Falls_Creek%2C_Victoria	Falls Creek, Victoria	Falls Creek is a ski-in, ski-out ski resort in north-eastern Victoria, Australia. It is located about 350 kilometres by road from Melbourne in the Alpine National Park, with the nearest town Mount Beauty, approximately 30 kilometres away. The resort lies between an altitude of 1,210 and 1,830 metres, with the highest lifted point at 1780 metres. Skiing is possible on the nearby peak of Mount McKay at 1,842 metres, traveling by snowcat from the resort. Until 2005, when the Government of Victoria did not renew grazing licenses, the high plains in the area were used for cattle grazing in the summer since 1851. Mount Bogong, Victoria's highest mountain, is nearby. Some of the cattlemen's huts still survive and are a tourist attraction in summer. After World War II the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme was started in the Kiewa River valley by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Falls_Creek_Logo.jpeg/110px-Falls_Creek_Logo.jpeg
