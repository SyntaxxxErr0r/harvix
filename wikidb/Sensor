88.4	Sensor	Sensor	A sensor (also called detector) is a converter that measures a physical quantity and converts it into a signal which can be read by an observer or by an (today mostly electronic) instrument. For example, a mercury-in-glass thermometer converts the measured temperature into expansion and contraction of a liquid which can be read on a calibrated glass tube. A thermocouple converts temperature to an output voltage which can be read by a voltmeter. For accuracy, most sensors are calibrated against known standards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Type_K_and_type_S.jpg/220px-Type_K_and_type_S.jpg
