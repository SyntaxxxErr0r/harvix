The Treaty of Tordesillas divided the Earth, outside Europe, in 1494 into Spanish and Portuguese global territorial hemispheres for exclusive conquest and colonization. Portugal colonized parts of South America (mostly Brazil), but also some failed attempts to colonize North America in present day Canada.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Portugal_Imp%C3%A9rio_total.png/222px-Portugal_Imp%C3%A9rio_total.png
