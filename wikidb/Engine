51.4	Engine	Engine	An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert energy into useful mechanical motion. Heat engines, including internal combustion engines and external combustion engines (such as steam engines) burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to create motion. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, pneumatic motors use compressed air and others, such as wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors like myosins in muscles use chemical energy to create motion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Mercedes_V6_DTM_Rennmotor_1996.jpg/220px-Mercedes_V6_DTM_Rennmotor_1996.jpg
