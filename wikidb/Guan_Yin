70.1	Guan_Yin	Guanyin	Guanyin is the bodhisattva associated with compassion as venerated by East Asian Buddhists, usually as a female. The name Guanyin is short for Guanshiyin which means "Observing the Sounds (or Cries) of the World". She is also sometimes referred to as Guanyin Pusa (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Guānyīn Púsà; Wade–Giles: Kuan-yin Pu-sah; literally "Bodhisattva Guanyin"). Some Buddhists believe that when one of their adherents departs from this world, they are placed by Guanyin in the heart of a lotus then sent home to the western pure land of Sukhāvatī.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Kuan-yan_bodhisattva%2C_Northern_Sung_dynasty%2C_China%2C_c._1025%2C_wood%2C_Honolulu_Academy_of_Arts.jpg/220px-Kuan-yan_bodhisattva%2C_Northern_Sung_dynasty%2C_China%2C_c._1025%2C_wood%2C_Honolulu_Academy_of_Arts.jpg
