2.10	Taxation_in_Iceland	Taxation in Iceland	Taxes in Iceland are levied by the state and the municipalities. Property rights are strong and Iceland is one of the few countries where they are applied to fishery management. Taxpayers pay various subsidies to each other, similar to European countries with welfare state, but the spending is less than in most European countries. Despite low tax rates, overall taxation and consumption is still much higher than countries such as Ireland. Employment regulations are relatively flexible.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Coat_of_arms_of_Iceland.svg/170px-Coat_of_arms_of_Iceland.svg.png
