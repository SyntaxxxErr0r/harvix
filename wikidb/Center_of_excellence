The focus area in this case might be a technology (e.g. Java), a business concept (e.g. BPM), a skill (e.g. negotiation) or a broad area of study (e.g. women's health). A center of excellence may also be aimed at revitalizing stalled initiatives.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/The_Julie_and_Hal_Moore_Center_for_Excellence.jpg/220px-The_Julie_and_Hal_Moore_Center_for_Excellence.jpg
