158.8	Ku_Klux_Klan	Ku Klux Klan	Ku Klux Klan, often abbreviated KKK and informally known as the Klan, is the name of three distinct past and present far-right organizations in the United States, which have advocated extremist reactionary currents such as white supremacy, white nationalism, and anti-immigration, historically expressed through terrorism. Since the mid-20th century, the KKK has also been anti-communist. The current manifestation is splintered into several chapters with no connections between each other; it is classified as a hate group. It is estimated to have between 3,000 and 5,000 members as of 2012.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Klan-in-gainesville.jpg/250px-Klan-in-gainesville.jpg
