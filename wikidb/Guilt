55.7	Guilt	Guilt	Guilt is the state of being responsible for the commission of an offense. It is also a cognitive or an emotional experience that occurs when a person realizes or believes—accurately or not—that he or she has violated a moral standard, and bears significant responsibility for that violation. It is closely related to the concept of remorse.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Singer_Sargent%2C_John_-_Orestes_Pursued_by_the_Furies_-_1921.jpg/220px-Singer_Sargent%2C_John_-_Orestes_Pursued_by_the_Furies_-_1921.jpg
