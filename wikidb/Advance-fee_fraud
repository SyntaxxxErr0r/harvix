89.8	Advance-fee_fraud	Advance-fee fraud	An advance-fee fraud is a confidence trick in which the target is persuaded to advance sums of money in the hope of realizing a significantly larger gain. Among the variations on this type of scam are the Nigerian Letter (also called the 419 fraud, Nigerian scam, Nigerian bank scam, or Nigerian money offer, or Fifo's Fraud), the Spanish Prisoner, the black money scam as well as Russian scam, and the Detroit/Buffalo scam (both also widespread, though far less popular than the formers). The so-called Russian and Nigerian scams stand for wholly dissimilar organized-crime traditions; they therefore tend to use altogether different breeds of approaches.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Africansting.jpg/280px-Africansting.jpg
