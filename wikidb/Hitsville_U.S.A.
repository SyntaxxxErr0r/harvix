23.60	Hitsville_U.S.A.	Hitsville U.S.A.	"Hitsville U.S.A." is the nickname given to Motown's first headquarters. A former photographers' studio located at 2648 West Grand Boulevard in Detroit, Michigan, it was purchased by Motown founder Berry Gordy in 1959 and converted into both the record label's administrative building and recording studio, which was open 22 hours a day (closing from 8 to 10 AM for maintenance). Following mainstream success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Gordy moved the label to Los Angeles and established the Hitsville West studio there, as a part of his main focus on not only music production, but also television and film production.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Hitsville_USA.jpg/250px-Hitsville_USA.jpg
