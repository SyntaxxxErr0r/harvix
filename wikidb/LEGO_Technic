1.00	LEGO_Technic	Lego Technic	Technic is a line of Lego interconnecting plastic rods and parts. The purpose of this series is to create more advanced models with more complex movable arms, such as machines with wheels, in addition to the simpler brick-building properties of normal Lego. The concept was introduced as the Expert Builder series and originally Technical Sets in 1977, and was renamed Technic in 1984.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Technic_logo.svg/200px-Technic_logo.svg.png
