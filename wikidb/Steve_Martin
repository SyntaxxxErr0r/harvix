93.7	Steve_Martin	Steve Martin	Stephen Glenn "Steve" Martin (born August 14, 1945) is an American actor, comedian, author, playwright, producer, musician and composer. Martin came to public notice as a writer for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and later became a frequent guest on The Tonight Show. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, absurdist comedy routines before packed houses on national tours. Since the 1980s, having branched away from stand-up comedy, he has become a successful actor, author, playwright, pianist, and banjo player, eventually earning Emmy, Grammy, and American Comedy awards, among others.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Steve_Martin_2011.jpg/220px-Steve_Martin_2011.jpg
