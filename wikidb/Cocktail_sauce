10.71	Cocktail_sauce	Cocktail sauce	Cocktail sauce is one of several types of cold or room temperature sauces often served as part of the dish(es) referred to as seafood cocktail or as a condiment with other seafoods. In America it generally consists of ketchup mixed with prepared horseradish. Some restaurants use chili sauce, a spicier tomato based sauce in place of the ketchup. The common form of cocktail sauce in Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Iceland, France and Belgium, usually consists of mayonnaise mixed with a tomato sauce to the same pink colour as prawns, producing a result that could be compared to fry sauce. Furthermore, in Belgium, a dash of whisky is often added to the sauce, and in Iceland, sour cream is considered essential. It is popularly served with steamed shrimp and seafood on the half shell. In Australia, it is often provided in fish and chip shops.
