29.86	Full_virtualization	Full virtualization	In computer science, full virtualization is a virtualization technique used to provide a certain kind of virtual machine environment, namely, one that is a complete simulation of the underlying hardware. Full virtualization requires that every salient feature of the hardware be reflected into one of several virtual machines â€“ including the full instruction set, input/output operations, interrupts, memory access, and whatever other elements are used by the software that runs on the bare machine, and that is intended to run in a virtual machine. In such an environment, any software capable of execution on the raw hardware can be run in the virtual machine and, in particular, any operating systems. The obvious test of virtualization is whether an operating system intended for stand-alone use can successfully run inside a virtual machine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/VirtualBox2.png/300px-VirtualBox2.png
