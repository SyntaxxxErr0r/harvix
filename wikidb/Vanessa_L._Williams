60.7	Vanessa_L._Williams	Vanessa L. Williams	Vanessa Lynn Williams (born March 18, 1963) is an American pop-R&amp;B recording artist, producer, dancer, model and actress. In 1983, she became the first woman of African-American descent to be crowned Miss America, but a scandal arose when Penthouse magazine bought and published nude photographs of her. She relinquished her title early and was succeeded by the first runner-up, Suzette Charles of New Jersey â€“ who was also African-American. Williams rebounded by launching a career as an entertainer, earning multiple Grammy, Emmy, and Tony Award nominations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Vanessa_Williams_homezfoo.jpg/220px-Vanessa_Williams_homezfoo.jpg
