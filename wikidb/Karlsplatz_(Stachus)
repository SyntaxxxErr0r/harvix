7.20	Karlsplatz_(Stachus)	Karlsplatz (Stachus)	Stachus is a large square in central Munich, southern Germany. The square has been named officially Karlsplatz in 1797 after the unpopular Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. Munich natives seldom use that name, calling the square instead Stachus, after the pub Beim Stachus, once owned by Eustachius FÃ¶derl, that was located there until construction work for Karlsplatz began.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Stachus-bv.jpg/220px-Stachus-bv.jpg
