55.7	Prophets_of_Islam	Prophets in Islam	Muslims identify the prophets of Islam and in the avoidance of idolatry and sin. Each came to preach Islam at different times in history and some, including Jesus, told of the coming of the final prophet and messenger of God, who would be named Muhammad. Each prophet directed a message to a different group of people, and thus would preach Islam in accordance with the times. Although many lay Muslims and many Western scholars and writers hold the view that Islam began with Muhammad in Mecca, this contradicts the Quran, which says that Muhammad simply was the last prophet who preached the same faith that Adam preached to his children.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Allah-eser-green.png/180px-Allah-eser-green.png
