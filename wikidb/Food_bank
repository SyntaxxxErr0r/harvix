43.67	Food_bank	Food bank	A food bank or foodbank is a non-profit, charitable organization that distributes mostly donated food to a wide variety of agencies that in turn feed poor people. The largest sources of food are for-profit growers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers who in the normal course of business have excess food that they cannot sell. There is considerable overlap with food salvage, food rescue and gleaning although not with freeganism or dumpster-diving.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Passing_out_groceries.jpg/220px-Passing_out_groceries.jpg
