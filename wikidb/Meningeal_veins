1.00	Meningeal_veins	Dura mater	The dura mater , or dura, is the outermost of the three layers of the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It is derived from mesoderm. The other two meningeal layers are the pia mater and the arachnoid mater. The dura surrounds the brain and the spinal cord and is responsible for keeping in the cerebrospinal fluid. The name dura mater is derived from the Latin "tough mother", from the related word "matrix" meaning "womb", and is also referred to by the term "pachymeninx" (plural "pachymeninges"). The dura has been described as "tough and inflexible" and "leather-like".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Meninges-en.svg/250px-Meninges-en.svg.png
