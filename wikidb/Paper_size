103.9	Paper_size	Paper size	Many paper size standards conventions have existed at different times and in different countries. Today there is one widespread international ISO standard (including A4, B3, C4, etc.) and a localised standard used in North America (including letter, legal, ledger, etc.). The paper sizes affect writing paper, stationery, cards, and some printed documents. The standards also have related sizes for envelopes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/A_size_illustration2_with_letter_and_legal.svg/220px-A_size_illustration2_with_letter_and_legal.svg.png
