It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function. If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or âˆ’1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Spearman_fig1.svg/300px-Spearman_fig1.svg.png
