8.10	P%C3%A5_%C3%96ster%C3%A5ker	På Österåker	På Österåker ("At Österåker")is a live album by country singer Johnny Cash released on Columbia Records in 1973, making it his 42nd overall release. The album features Cash's concert at the Österåker Prison in Sweden held on October 3, 1972. Its predecessors in concept are the more notable At San Quentin and At Folsom Prison. Unlike the aforementioned, På Österåker does not contain any of Cash's most well-known songs; it does, however, include a version of Kris Kristofferson's "Me and Bobby McGee". "Orleans Parish Prison" was released as a single, faring rather poorly on the charts. "I Saw a Man" came from Cash's 1959 album, Hymns by Johnny Cash.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/JohnnyCashPaOsteraker.jpg/220px-JohnnyCashPaOsteraker.jpg
