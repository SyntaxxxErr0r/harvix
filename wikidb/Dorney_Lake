10.72	Dorney_Lake	Dorney Lake	Dorney Lake (also known as Eton College Rowing Centre) is a purpose-built rowing lake in England. It is located at grid reference near the village of Dorney, Buckinghamshire, and near the towns of Windsor and Eton, close to the River Thames. The lake is privately owned and financed by Eton College, who have spent £17 million developing it. Additional grants, totalling £500,000, were obtained from Sport England, UK Sport, the DCMS and SEEDA in order to build the lake's finish tower. The project was completed in 2006, after 10 years of construction. Although it is primarily for use by the school, the facilities are hired out for rowing, as well as for canoeing, dragon boating and triathlon training.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Dorney_Lake.jpg/240px-Dorney_Lake.jpg
