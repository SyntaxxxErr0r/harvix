Starting in the 1950s, jeans, originally designed for cowboys, became popular among teenagers. Historic brands include Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler. Jeans come in various fits, including skinny, tapered, straight, boot cut, Mommy-cut, maternity, and flare.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Jeans_for_men.jpg/220px-Jeans_for_men.jpg
