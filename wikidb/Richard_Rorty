70.5	Richard_Rorty	Richard Rorty	Richard McKay Rorty (October 4, 1931 â€“ June 8, 2007) was an American philosopher. He had a long and diverse academic career, including positions as Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton, Kenan Professor of Humanities at the University of Virginia, and Professor of Comparative Literature at Stanford University. His complex intellectual background gave him a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the traditional analytic philosophy, which he would later famously reject in favor of his own brand of pragmatism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1c/Rorty.jpg/220px-Rorty.jpg
