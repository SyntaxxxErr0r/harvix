7.10	Formula_Libre	Formula Libre	Formula Libre (also known as 'Formule Libre') is a form of automobile racing allowing a wide variety of types, ages and makes of purpose-built racing cars to compete "head to head". This can make for some interesting matchups, and provides the opportunity for some compelling driving performances against superior machinery. The name translates to "Free Formula" - in Formula Libre races the only regulations typically govern basics such as safety equipment.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/RoadAmericaMixedFieldOctober2008.jpg/220px-RoadAmericaMixedFieldOctober2008.jpg
