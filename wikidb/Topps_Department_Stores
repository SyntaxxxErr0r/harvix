1.00	Topps_Department_Stores	White Front	White Front was a chain of discount stores in Southern California and the western United States from 1959 through the mid-1970s. They were noted for the architecture of their store fronts which was an enormous, sweeping archway with the store name spelled out in individual letters fanned across the top. The chain also ran Topps, a similar discount store with locations in the American Midwest.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/White_Frontlogo.PNG
