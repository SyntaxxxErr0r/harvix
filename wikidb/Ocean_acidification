76.5	Ocean_acidification	Ocean acidification	Ocean acidification is the name given to the ongoing decrease in the pH and increase in acidity of the Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. About a quarter of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes into the oceans, where it forms carbonic acid.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/WOA05_GLODAP_del_pH_AYool.png/300px-WOA05_GLODAP_del_pH_AYool.png
