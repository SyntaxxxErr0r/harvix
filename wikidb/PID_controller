140.0	PID_controller	PID controller	A proportional–integral–derivative controller is a generic control loop feedback mechanism (controller) widely used in industrial control systems – a PID is the most commonly used feedback controller. A PID controller calculates an "error" value as the difference between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint. The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process control inputs.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/PID_en.svg/300px-PID_en.svg.png
