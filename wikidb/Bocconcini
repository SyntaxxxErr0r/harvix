34.61	Bocconcini	Bocconcini	Bocconcini (singular Bocconcino, ) are small mozzarella cheeses the size of an egg. Like other mozzarellas, they are semi-soft, white and rindless unripened mild cheeses which originated in Napoli and were once made only from milk of water buffaloes. Nowadays they are usually made from a combination of water buffalo and cow's milk. Bocconcini are packaged in whey or water, have a spongy texture and absorb flavours.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Bocconcini_gobeirne.jpg/220px-Bocconcini_gobeirne.jpg
