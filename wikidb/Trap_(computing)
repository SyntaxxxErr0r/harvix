6.02	Trap_(computing)	Trap (computing)	In computing and operating systems, a trap, also known as an exception or a fault, is typicallyNB 1 a type of synchronous interrupt typically caused by an exceptional condition (e.g., breakpoint, division by zero, invalid memory access). A trap usually results in a switch to kernel mode, wherein the operating system performs some action before returning control to the originating process. A trap in a system process is more serious than a trap in a user process, and in some systems is fatal. In some usages, the term trap refers specifically to an interrupt intended to initiate a context switch to a monitor program or debugger.
