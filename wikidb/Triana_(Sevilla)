2.02	Triana_(Sevilla)	Triana, Seville	Triana is a neighbourhood and administrative district on the west bank of the Guadalquivir River in the city of Seville, Spain. Like other neighborhoods that were historically separated from the main city, it was known as an arrabal. Triana is located on an almost-island between two branches of the Guadalquivir, narrowly linked to the mainland in the north. Two other districts are also usually included in this area, Los Remedios to the south and La Cartuja to the north.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Pont_Triana.jpg/220px-Pont_Triana.jpg
