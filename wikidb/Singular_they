53.5	Singular_they	Singular they	Distributive constructions apply a single idea to multiple members of a group, hence involving both singularities (the idea, the group, each individual member, and the relation of idea to member) and pluralities (the members and the repeated relation). They are typically marked in English by words like each, every and any. The simplest examples are applied to groups of two, and use words like either and orâ€”"Would you like tea or coffee" . Thorough analysis of distribution requires treatment of negation. Hence, the Shakespeare quote above is semantically distributive, because there's not a man who... is logically equivalent to every man does not.... Since distributive constructions apply an idea relevant to each individual in the group, rather than to the group as a whole, they are most often conceived of as singular, and a singular pronoun is used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2e/Distributive.svg/300px-Distributive.svg.png
