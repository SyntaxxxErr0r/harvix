One of the bloodiest engagements of the Kentucky frontier, the battle has long been the subject of controversy resulting from the actions of one of Estill's officers, William Miller, who ordered a retreat leaving the rest of Estill's command to be overwhelmed by the attacking Wyandots.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Ohio_Country_en.png/220px-Ohio_Country_en.png
