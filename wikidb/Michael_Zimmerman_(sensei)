Zimmerman had come to Zen Buddhism in 1993 seeking a support system for himself as his first wife Lynne battled terminal cancer. Later, through his work in the courts, he met Diane and began sitting zazen at Kanzeon Zen Center with Merzel under Hamilton's suggestion. The two were married by Merzel in 1998. Zimmerman is currently a practicing attorney for Snell &amp; Wilmer in Salt Lake City. From 1984 to 2000 he served as a Justice for the Utah Supreme Court, and from 1994 to 1998 he acted as Chief Justice.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Michael_Mugaku_Zimmerman_%26_Diane_Musho_Hamilton.jpg/220px-Michael_Mugaku_Zimmerman_%26_Diane_Musho_Hamilton.jpg
