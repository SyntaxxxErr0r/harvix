55.4	Atomic_orbital	Atomic orbital	An atomic orbital is a mathematical function that describes the wave-like behavior of either one electron or a pair of electrons in an atom. This function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the atom's nucleus. The term may also refer to the physical region where the electron can be calculated to be, as defined by the particular mathematical form of the orbital.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Neon_orbitals.JPG
