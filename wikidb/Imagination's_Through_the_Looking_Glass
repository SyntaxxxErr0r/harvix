Instead, Blind Guardian decided to create their own festival, back in their homeland. The First Blind Guardian Festival was held in Coburg, Germany, at June 16â€“17, 2003. It lasted 2 days, with the band playing during both nights. The entire show has been professionally recorded and subsequently released on a DVD entitled Imaginations through the Looking Glass on June 14, 2004.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Imaginations_through_the_looking_glass.jpg
