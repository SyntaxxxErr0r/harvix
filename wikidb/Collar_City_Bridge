1.10	Collar_City_Bridge	Collar City Bridge	The Collar City Bridge (also known as the Hoosick Street Bridge) carries NY 7 across the Hudson River connecting Colonie, New York with Troy, by way of passing over Green Island. As the Northern Terminus of Interstate 787 is unclear, it may share a concurrency with NY 7 across the bridge.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/CollarCityBridge.jpg/250px-CollarCityBridge.jpg
