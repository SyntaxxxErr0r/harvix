117.7	Paella	Paella	Paella is a Valencian rice dish that originated in its modern form in the mid-19th century near lake Albufera, a lagoon in Valencia, on the east coast of Spain. Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain's national dish, but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/9paella.jpg/300px-9paella.jpg
