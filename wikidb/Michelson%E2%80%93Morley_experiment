66.1	Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment	Michelson–Morley experiment	The Michelson–Morley experiment was performed in 1887 by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Its results are generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the theory of a luminiferous aether and in favor of special relativity. The most immediate effect at the time was to put an end to Lord Kelvin's Vortex theory, which said that atoms were vortices in the aether. The experiment has also been referred to as "the moving-off point for the theoretical aspects of the Second Scientific Revolution".
