60.0	Fox_Mulder	Fox Mulder	FBI Special Agent Fox William Mulder is a fictional character and one of the two protagonists of the Fox television series The X-Files. Mulder's peers consider his (often correct) theories on extraterrestrial activity as spooky and far-fetched. With his FBI partner Dana Scully, he works in the X-Files office, which is concerned with cases with particularly mysterious or possibly paranormal circumstances that were left unsolved and shelved by the FBI. Portrayed by American actor David Duchovny, Mulder was a main character for the first seven seasons but was limited to a recurring character for the last two seasons because portraying actor Duchovny wanted to move on to the film industry.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/Xfiles-FoxMulder-small.jpg
