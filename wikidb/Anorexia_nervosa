110.1	Anorexia_nervosa	Anorexia nervosa	Anorexia is an eating disorder characterized by excessive weight loss, irrational fear of gaining weight and a distorted body self-perception. Anorexia nervosa usually develops during adolescence and early adulthood. Due to the fear of gaining weight, people with this disorder restrict the amount of food they intake. This restriction of food intake causes metabolic and hormonal disorders. The terms anorexia nervosa and anorexia are often used interchangeably, however, anorexia is simply a medical term for lack of appetite. Anorexia nervosa has many complicated implications and may be thought of as a lifelong illness that may never be truly cured, but only managed over time. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by low body weight, inappropriate eating habits and obsession with having a thin figure. Individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa may also practice repeated weighing, measuring, mirror gazing, alongside other obsessive actions to make sure they are still thin. Such a common practice seen amongst patients is body checking.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Gull_-_Anorexia_Miss_A.jpg/230px-Gull_-_Anorexia_Miss_A.jpg
