They are believed to be descended from the Venetian Jewish del Banco family, in the early 1500s one of the wealthiest Venetian families. The Warburgs fled from Italy to Warburg in Germany in the 16th century before moving to Altona, near Hamburg in the 17th century. They took their surname from the city of Warburg. The brothers Moses Marcus Warburg and Gerson Warburg (1765 - 1826) founded the M. M. Warburg &amp; Co. banking company in 1798 that is still in existence. Moses Warburg's great-great grandson, Siegmund George Warburg, founded the investment bank S. G. Warburg &amp; Co in London in 1946. Siegmund's second cousin, Eric Warburg, founded Warburg Pincus in New York in 1938. Eric Warburg's son Max Warburg (not to be confused with Eric's father Max Warburg) is currently one of the three partners of M.M.Warburg &amp; Co., Warburg. The Warburg family created the following investment banks: M.M.Warburg &amp; Co., Warburg Pincus, S. G. Warburg &amp; Co.. Max Warburg's elder brother Aby Warburg used his money to establish the Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg in Hamburg, since 1934 The Warburg Institute in London. Paul Warburg is most famous as the architect of the US monetary regime, the Federal Reserve System established in 1913.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/People_outside_The_Jewish_Museum_-_2004_Museum_Mile_Festival_.jpg/220px-People_outside_The_Jewish_Museum_-_2004_Museum_Mile_Festival_.jpg
