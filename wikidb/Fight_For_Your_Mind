1.00	Fight_For_Your_Mind	Fight for Your Mind	Fight for Your Mind is an album by Ben Harper. Released in August 1995, it was his last solo album before adding the Innocent Criminals to his line-up. Reviews were generally very positive, praising Harper's fusion of multiple genres, from folk ("Another Lonely Day"), folk rock ("Gold to Me"), Black Sabbath-style riffing heavy metal ("Ground on Down") and politically-charged reggae ("Excuse Me Mr.").	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/BenHarperFightForYourMind.jpg
