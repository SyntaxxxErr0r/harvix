72.7	Energy_Star	Energy Star	Energy Star is an international standard for energy efficient consumer products originated in the United States of America. It was created in 1992 by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy during the Clinton Administration. Since then, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Taiwan and the European Union have adopted the program. Devices carrying the Energy Star service mark, such as computer products and peripherals, kitchen appliances, buildings and other products, generally use 20%â€“30% less energy than required by federal standards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Energy_Star_logo.svg/200px-Energy_Star_logo.svg.png
