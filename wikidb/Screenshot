79.1	Screenshot	Screenshot	A screen dump, screen capture (or screencap), screenshot (or screen shot), screengrab (or screen grab), or print screen is an image taken by a computer to record the visible items displayed on the monitor, television, or another visual output device. Usually this is a digital image taken by the host operating system or software running on the computer, but it can also be a capture made by a camera or a device intercepting the video output of the display (such as a DVR).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ubuntu_11.10_Final.png/275px-Ubuntu_11.10_Final.png
