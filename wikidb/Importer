3.10	Importer	Import	The term import is derived from the conceptual meaning as to bring in the goods and services into the port of a country. The buyer of such goods and services is referred to an "importer" who is based in the country of import whereas the overseas based seller is referred to as an "exporter". Thus an import is any good (e.g. a commodity) or service brought in from one country to another country in a legitimate fashion, typically for use in trade. It is a good that is brought in from another country for sale. Import goods or services are provided to domestic consumers by foreign producers. An import in the receiving country is an export to the sending country.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Storck_Harbour_scene.jpg/180px-Storck_Harbour_scene.jpg
