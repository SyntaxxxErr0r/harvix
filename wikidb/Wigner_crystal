6.61	Wigner_crystal	Wigner crystal	A Wigner crystal is the solid (crystalline) phase of electrons first predicted by Eugene Wigner in 1934. A gas of electrons moving in 2D or 3D in a uniform, inert, neutralizing background will crystallize and form a lattice if the electron density is less than a critical value. This is because the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy at low densities, so the detailed spatial arrangement of the electrons becomes important. To minimize the potential energy, the electrons form a b.c.c. lattice in 3D, a triangular lattice in 2D and a evenly spaced lattice in 1D. Most experimentally observed Wigner clusters exist due to the presence of the external confinement, i.e. external potential trap. As a consequence, deviations from the b.c.c or triangular lattice are observed . A crystalline state of the 2D electron gas can also be realized by applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field. However, it is still not clear whether it is the Wigner-crystalization that has led to observation of insulating behaviours in magnetotransport measurements on 2D electron systems, since other candidates are present, such as Anderson localization.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Wigner_cluster_600.png/220px-Wigner_cluster_600.png
