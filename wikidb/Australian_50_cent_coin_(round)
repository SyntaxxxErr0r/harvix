1.01	Australian_50_cent_coin_(round)	Australian round fifty-cent coin	The round fifty cent coin was the highest-denomination and largest diameter coin of the Australian dollar's decimal coins, introduced in 1966. Due to large amounts made in 1966 and the rising cost of silver, it was not made in any other year. It was replaced by a dodecagonal 50 cent coin in 1969, which retained its reverse of the Australian Coat of Arms.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/1966_Round_50_Cent_Coin_Obverse.png/220px-1966_Round_50_Cent_Coin_Obverse.png
