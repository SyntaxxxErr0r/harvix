The work focuses on Colin, a poor Nottingham teenager from a dismal home in a blue-collar area, who has bleak prospects in life and few interests beyond petty crime. The boy turns to long-distance running as a method of both an emotional and a physical escape from his situation. The story was adapted for a 1962 film of the same title, with Sillitoe writing the screenplay and Tony Richardson directing. The part of Colin was played by Tom Courtenay.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/TheLonelinessOfTheLongDistanceRunner.jpg/220px-TheLonelinessOfTheLongDistanceRunner.jpg
