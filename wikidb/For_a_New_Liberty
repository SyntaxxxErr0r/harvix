4.40	For_a_New_Liberty	For a New Liberty	For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto is a book by American economist and historian Murray N. Rothbard, first published in 1973, that helped launch the modern libertarian movement in the United States, and was the first modern free market anarchist manifesto (though both capitalistic and anti-capitalistic theories of free-market anarchism had been advanced by the 19th century individualist anarchists). The second edition was first published in 1978, while the third edition was first published in 1985. It is the only book for which Rothbard received a mainstream publishing contract. Radicals for Capitalism notes, "This book strove to synthesize, in condensed form, the economic, historical, philosophical, and policy elements of Rothbard's vision...the book was meant as both a primer and a manifesto, so Rothbard crammed in as much of his overall theory of liberty as he could...Rothbard hits the harder anarcho-capitalist stuff, but slips it in so smoothly that many readers might not notice that this 'libertarian manifesto' promotes anarchism."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/For_A_New_Liberty.png/200px-For_A_New_Liberty.png
