320.5	Theremin	Theremin	The theremin , originally known as the ætherphone/etherphone, thereminophone or termenvox/thereminvox is an early electronic musical instrument controlled without discernible physical contact from the player. It is named after its Russian inventor, Professor Léon Theremin, who patented the device in 1928. The controlling section usually consists of two metal antennas which sense the position of the player's hands and control oscillators for frequency with one hand, and amplitude (volume) with the other, so it can be played without being touched. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Etherwave_Theremin_Kit.jpg/250px-Etherwave_Theremin_Kit.jpg
