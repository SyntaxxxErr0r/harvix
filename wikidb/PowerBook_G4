70.7	PowerBook_G4	PowerBook G4	The PowerBook G4 is a series of notebook computers that were manufactured, marketed, and sold by Apple, Inc. (then Apple Computer, Inc) between 2001 and 2006 as part of its PowerBook line. It uses the PowerPC G4 processor, initially produced by Motorola and later by Freescale, after Motorola spun off its semiconductor business under that name in 2004. The PowerBook G4 had two different designs: one enclosed in a titanium body with a translucent black keyboard and a 15" screen; and another in an aluminium body with an aluminium-colored keyboard, in 12", 15", and 17" sizes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/PowerBook_redjar.jpg/200px-PowerBook_redjar.jpg
