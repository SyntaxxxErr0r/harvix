13.01	Tippe_top	Tippe top	A tippe top is a kind of top. When a tippe top is spun at a high angular velocity, its handle slowly tilts downwards more and more until it lifts the body of the top off the ground with the stem pointing downward. As the top's spinning rate slows, it loses stability and eventually topples over.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Tippe_Top.jpg/200px-Tippe_Top.jpg
