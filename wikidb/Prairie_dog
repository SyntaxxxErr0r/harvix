The five different species of prairie dogs are: black-tailed, white-tailed, Gunnison's, Utah and Mexican prairie dogs. They are a type of ground squirrel, found in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In Mexico, prairie dogs are primarily found in the northern states which are the southern end of the great plains: northeastern Sonora, north and northeastern Chihuahua, northern Coahuila, northern Nuevo Le√≥n, and northern Tamaulipas. In the U.S., they range primarily to the west of the Mississippi River, though they have also been introduced in a few eastern locales. They are herbivorous.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Black-Tailed_Prairie_Dog_Eating.jpg/225px-Black-Tailed_Prairie_Dog_Eating.jpg
