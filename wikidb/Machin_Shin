1.00	Machin_Shin	The Ways (Wheel of Time)	The Ways are an alternate dimension in Robert Jordan's fictional Wheel of Time series. The Ways are accessed through Waygates, introduced in the first book in the series, The Eye of the World. A Waygate is a doorway carved out of stone; when the correct leaf (a leaf from Avendesora, the Tree of Life) in the intricate carving of a Chora tree is removed, it opens up, allowing access to the Ways. This alternate dimension leads to other Waygates, which makes travelling through this dimension useful since distances are shorter in the Ways. Thus, traveling a few miles in the dimension of the Ways and exiting into the real word will put the user hundreds of miles from one's starting point. In the contemporary era of the Wheel of Time series, Waygates and the Ways are distinctly less useful as they have (since their creation) become corrupted, and are positively dangerous. Machin Shin roams the ways, causing all to fear traveling the Ways. Thus, while the characters are sometimes forced to use them, it is at the peril of their lives.
