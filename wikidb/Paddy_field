35.27	Paddy_field	Paddy field	A paddy field is a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing rice and other semiaquatic crops. Paddy fields are a typical feature of rice farming in east, south and southeast Asia. Paddies can be built into steep hillsides as terraces and adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or marshes. They can require a great deal of labor and materials to create, and need large quantities of water for irrigation. Flooded paddies provide an ideal environment for rice cultivation and discourage the growth of many weeds. The water buffalo is one of the most important working animals adapted for life in wetlands, and is used extensively in paddy field farming.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Rice_Field.jpg/220px-Rice_Field.jpg
