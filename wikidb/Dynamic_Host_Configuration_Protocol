98.7	Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol	The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a network configuration protocol for hosts on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Computers that are connected to IP networks must be configured before they can communicate with other hosts. The most essential information needed is an IP address, and a default route and routing prefix. DHCP eliminates the manual task by a network administrator. It also provides a central database of devices that are connected to the network and eliminates duplicate resource assignments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/DHCP_Server.png/300px-DHCP_Server.png
