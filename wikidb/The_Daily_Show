71.9	The_Daily_Show	The Daily Show	The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (called The Daily Show until 1999), is an American late night satirical television program airing each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central and, in Canada, The Comedy Network. The half-hour long show premiered on July 21, 1996, and was hosted by Craig Kilborn until December 1998. Jon Stewart took over as host in January 1999, making the show more strongly focused on politics and the national media, in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn's tenure. It is currently the longest running program on Comedy Central, and has won sixteen Emmy Awards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Dailyshow_logo.svg/220px-Dailyshow_logo.svg.png
