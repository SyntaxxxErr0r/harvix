57.0	Cartilage	Cartilage	Cartilage is a flexible connective tissue found in many areas in the bodies of humans and other animals, including the joints between bones, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the elbow, the knee, the ankle, the bronchial tubes and the intervertebral discs. It is not as hard and rigid as bone but is stiffer and less flexible than muscle.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Hypertrophic_Zone_of_Epiphyseal_Plate.jpg/250px-Hypertrophic_Zone_of_Epiphyseal_Plate.jpg
