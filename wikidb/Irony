104.4	Irony	Irony	Irony (from the Ancient Greek , meaning dissimulation or feigned ignorance) is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or situation in which there is a sharp incongruity or discordance that goes beyond the simple and evident intention of words or actions. There is presently no accepted method for textually indicating irony, though an irony (punctuation) mark has been proposed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Stop_Defacing_Signs.jpg/170px-Stop_Defacing_Signs.jpg
