1.13	Containerboard	Containerboard	Containerboard, also referred to as CCM (corrugated case material), is a type of paperboard specially manufactured for the production of corrugated board. The term encompasses both linerboard and corrugating medium (or fluting), the two types of paper that make up corrugated board. Since containerboard is made mainly out of natural unbleached wood fibers, it is generally brown, although its shade can vary depending on the type of wood, pulping process, recycling rate and impurities content. For certain boxes that demand good presentation white bleached pulp or coating is used on the top ply of the linerboard that goes outside the box.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Corrugated_Cardboard.JPG/220px-Corrugated_Cardboard.JPG
