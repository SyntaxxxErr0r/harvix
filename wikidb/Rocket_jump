The rocket's explosion propels the player to greater heights and distances than otherwise possible. One downside of this technique is that the rocket blast usually injures the player; this can be coupled with further damage if the player falls large distances to the ground. This effect makes the techniques less useful in games where the damage from the blast, fall, or both is high. In many games a well executed rocket jump results in a minimal damage, and a larger boost. In addition, in games with team damaging disabled, a teammate can use his rocket to jump someone else. The technique is used especially in competitive play where it is used in order to get to the middle capture point quickly in order to get an advantage over the other team. This is why new ways of jumping are being thought of all the time. Speedrunning is finishing jump maps as fast as possible and involves a lot of skill to master. In Quake III: Arena some of the computer-controlled opponents use rocket jumps.
