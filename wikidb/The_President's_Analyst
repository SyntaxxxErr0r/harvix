The widescreen cinematography was by William A. Fraker, and Lalo Schifrin provided the film's musical score. The film has elements of political satire and science fiction, and resembles many of the spy spoofs that proliferated in the mid-60s in the wake of the James Bond phenomenon, including Coburn's Our Man Flint and In Like Flint. The film's themes include privacy concerns, specifically regarding the U.S. Governmentâ€™s intrusions into the private lives of its citizens.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/Presidents_movieposter.jpg/220px-Presidents_movieposter.jpg
