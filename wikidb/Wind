134.1	Wind	Wind	Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale. On Earth, wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in our solar system occur on Neptune and Saturn.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/33-vento_orientale%2CTaccuino_Sanitatis%2C_Casanatense_4182..jpg/220px-33-vento_orientale%2CTaccuino_Sanitatis%2C_Casanatense_4182..jpg
