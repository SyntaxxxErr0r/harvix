2.00	Electric_Lucifer	The Electric Lucifer	The Electric Lucifer is an early electronic album by Bruce Haack noted for its originality and innovative use of acid rock and electronic sounds. AllMusic.com describes it as "a psychedelic, anti-war song cycle about the battle between heaven and hell." Haack used a Moog synthesizer and his own home-built electronics, including an early prototype vocoder. It was originally released on LP in 1970 and has been re-mastered and re-released on CD several times since. "Song of the Death Machine" and "Word Game" both feature vocals by Chris Kachulis. The lyrics are also highly original, mentioning concepts such as "powerlove" â€” a force so strong and good that it will not only save mankind but Lucifer himself. It remains Haack's only album to debut on a major label and was featured heavily in the 2004 documentary Haack: The King of Techno.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/Album_Electric_Lucifer.jpg/220px-Album_Electric_Lucifer.jpg
