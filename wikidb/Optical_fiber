136.3	Optical_fiber	Optical fiber	An optical fiber is a flexible, transparent fiber made of a pure glass (silica) not much thicker than a human hair. It functions as a waveguide, or “light pipe”, to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber. The field of applied science and engineering concerned with the design and application of optical fibers is known as fiber optics. Optical fibers are widely used in fiber-optic communications, which permits transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than other forms of communication. Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss and are also immune to electromagnetic interference. Fibers are also used for illumination, and are wrapped in bundles so that they may be used to carry images, thus allowing viewing in confined spaces. Specially-designed fibers are used for a variety of other applications, including sensors and fiber lasers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Fibreoptic.jpg/220px-Fibreoptic.jpg
