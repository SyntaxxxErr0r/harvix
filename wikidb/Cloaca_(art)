10.64	Cloaca_(art)	Wim Delvoye	Wim Delvoye (born 1965 in Wervik, West Flanders) is a Belgian neo-conceptual artist known for his inventive and often shocking projects. Much of his work is focused on the body. He repeatedly links the attractive with the repulsive, creating work that holds within it inherent contradictions- one does not know whether to stare, be seduced, or to look away. As Robert Enright wrote in Border Crossings, "Delvoye is involved in a way of making art that reorients our understanding of how beauty can be created." Wim Delvoye has an eclectic oeuvre, exposing his interest in a range of themes, from bodily function, to the Catholic Church, and numerous subjects in between. He lives and works in Belgium, but recently moved to China after a court of law judged his pig tattoo art projects illegal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Delvoye%2C_Untitled_%28Cloaca_IV%29%2C_2004.jpeg/130px-Delvoye%2C_Untitled_%28Cloaca_IV%29%2C_2004.jpeg
