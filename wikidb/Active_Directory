126.1	Active_Directory	Active Directory	In Microsoft's Active Directory, OUs do not confer access permissions, and objects placed within OUs are not automatically assigned access privileges based on their containing OU. This is a design limitation specific to Active Directory. Other competing directories such as Novell NDS are able to assign access privileges through object placement within an OU.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/Active_directory_-_OUs_can_not_be_given_rights_to_objects.png/220px-Active_directory_-_OUs_can_not_be_given_rights_to_objects.png
