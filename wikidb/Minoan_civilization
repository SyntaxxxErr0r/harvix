80.8	Minoan_civilization	Minoan civilization	Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age civilization that arose on the island of Crete, came to dominate the shores and islands of the Aegean Sea, and flourished as a maritime power from approximately the 27th century BC to the 15th century BC. It was rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century by British archaeologist Arthur Evans. Will Durant referred to it as "the first link in the European chain." The earliest inhabitants of Crete may have settled as early as 800,000 BC, during the Middle Paleolithic age. Hand-axes of the type attributed to Homo erectus in Africa, except the material is local quartz, rather than flint, have been found at Preveli Gorge in southern Crete. However, it was not until 5000 BC that the first signs of advanced agriculture appeared. Minoan civilization is considered to have begun with the palace complexes that appeared in the Bronze Age. The relationships of the Minoans with the more ancient peoples of Crete are unknown.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Map_Minoan_Crete-en.svg/360px-Map_Minoan_Crete-en.svg.png
