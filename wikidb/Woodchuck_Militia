1.00	Woodchuck_Militia	Duck universe	The Duck universe (also called the Donald Duck universe or Scrooge McDuck universe) is a fictional universe where Disney cartoon characters Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck live. It is a spin off of the older Mickey Mouse universe, yet has become much more extensive. "Duck universe" is a term used by fans and is not an official part of the Disney lexicon.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Holiday_in_Duckburg.jpg
