10.06	Simon_the_Sorcerer	Simon the Sorcerer	Simon the Sorcerer is an adventure game that was released by Adventure Soft on 2 January 1993 for Amiga and MS-DOS formats. The story begins with the protagonist, Simon, as an ordinary teenager. His dog, "Chippy", discovers a chest in the loft of his house containing a spellbook titled "Ye Olde Spellbooke" (which Simon derisively reads as "Ye old-ee spellbook-ee"). Simon throws the book onto the floor in contempt, but a portal opens above it. Chippy goes through the portal and Simon follows.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Simon_1_cover.jpg/250px-Simon_1_cover.jpg
