74.3	Islamic_banking	Islamic banking	Islamic banking (or participant banking) and its practical application through the development of Islamic economics. Sharia prohibits the fixed or floating payment or acceptance of specific interest or fees (known as riba or usury) for loans of money. Investing in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles is also haraam (forbidden). While these principles may have been applied to historical Islamic economies, it is only in the late 20th century that a number of Islamic banks were formed to apply these principles to private or semi-private commercial institutions within the Muslim community.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/National_Bank_Oamaru.jpg/180px-National_Bank_Oamaru.jpg
