"Lou" Lowery (July 24, 1916 â€“ April 15, 1987) was a United States Marine Corps photographer best known for taking the first flag-raising photograph on Iwo Jima on February 23, 1945. The first flag raised was too small to be seen easily from the nearby landing beaches, so a second, larger flag was raised, resulting in the famous photograph taken by Joe Rosenthal that was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography in 1945.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Iwojimaflag.jpg/119px-Iwojimaflag.jpg
