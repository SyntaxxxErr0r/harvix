1.00	Deir_el_Qamar_Synagogue	Deir el Qamar Synagogue	The Deir el Qamar Synagogue, located in Deir el Qamar, a village in south-central Lebanon, is the oldest synagogue in Mount Lebanon. The synagogue was built in the 17th century to serve the local Jewish population, some of whom were part of the immediate entourage of Fakhr-al-Din II. The building is in good condition. It has been shut to the public due to security considerations. After restoration work which had removed all religious symbols, the synagogue has been entrusted to the French cultural center by the General Directorate of Antiquities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Deir_synagogue.jpg/250px-Deir_synagogue.jpg
