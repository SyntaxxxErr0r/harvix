1.00	Methanoic_acid	Formic acid	Formic acid (also called methanoic acid) is the simplest carboxylic acid. Its chemical formula is HCOOH or HCO2H. It is an important intermediate in chemical synthesis and occurs naturally, most notably in the venom of bee and ant stings. In fact, its name comes from the Latin word for ant, formica, referring to its early isolation by the distillation of ant bodies. Esters, salts, and the anion derived from formic acid are referred to as formates.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Ameisens%C3%A4ure_Keilstrich.svg/120px-Ameisens%C3%A4ure_Keilstrich.svg.png
