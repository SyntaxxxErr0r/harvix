8.20	Zeratul	Zeratul	Zeratul is one of the central characters in the StarCraft series. At six hundred and thirty-five years old (born in 1865 according to Matt Cohen) and holding the rank of prelate, Zeratul is a member of the Nerazim, better known as the dark templar, whose forebears were exiled from the protoss homeworld of Aiur over a thousand years ago for refusing to submit to the Khala. A renowned psionic warrior and assassin, he is described by GameSpot as a "savior" and "willing scapegoat" for his people and ranked in their top ten heroes chart. During the later episodes he takes part in defeating the Overmind on Aiur and reuniting the dark templar with the rest of their people. Zeratul was voiced by the late Jack Ritschel in StarCraft and Brood War, and by Fred Tatasciore in StarCraft II.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Zeratul.png/230px-Zeratul.png
