56.0	Pascal's_wager	Pascal's Wager	Pascal’s Wager (also known as Pascal’s Gambit) is a suggestion posed by the seventeenth-century French philosopher, mathematician, and physicist Blaise Pascal that, since the existence of God cannot be proved or disproved through reason, and there is much to be gained from wagering that God exists and little to be gained from wagering that God doesn’t exist, a rational person should simply wager that God exists and live accordingly.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Blaise_Pascal_Versailles.JPG/220px-Blaise_Pascal_Versailles.JPG
