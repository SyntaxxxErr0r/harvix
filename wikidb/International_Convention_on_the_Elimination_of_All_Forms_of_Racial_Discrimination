6.23	International_Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Racial_Discrimination	Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination	The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) is a United Nations convention. A second-generation human rights instrument, the Convention commits its members to the elimination of racial discrimination and the promotion of understanding among all races. Controversially, the Convention also requires its parties to outlaw hate speech and criminalize membership in racist organizations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/ICERD-members.PNG/400px-ICERD-members.PNG
