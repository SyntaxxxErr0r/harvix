137.5	Spambot	Spambot	A spambot is an automated computer program designed to assist in the sending of spam. Spambots usually create fake accounts and send spam using them, although it would be obvious that a spambot is sending it. Some spambots, however, can crack passwords and send spam using other people's accounts.
