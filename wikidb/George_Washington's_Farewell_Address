51.9	George_Washington's_Farewell_Address	George Washington's Farewell Address	George Washington's Farewell Address is a letter written by the first American President, George Washington, to "The People of the United States". Washington wrote the letter near the end of his second term as President, before his retirement to his home Mount Vernon. Originally published in David Claypoole's American Daily Advertiser on September 19, 1796 under the title "The Address of General Washington To The People of The United States on his declining of the Presidency of the United States," the letter was almost immediately reprinted in newspapers across the country and later in a pamphlet form. The work was later named a "Farewell Address," as it was Washington's valedictory after 45 years of service to the new nation. It is a classic statement of republicanism, warning Americans of the political dangers they can and must avoid if they are to remain true to their values.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/Washington_Farewell_Broadside.jpg/400px-Washington_Farewell_Broadside.jpg
