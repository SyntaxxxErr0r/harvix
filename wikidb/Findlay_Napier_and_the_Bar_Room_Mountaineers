2.00	Findlay_Napier_and_the_Bar_Room_Mountaineers	Findlay Napier and the Bar Room Mountaineers	Findlay Napier and the Bar Room Mountaineers began playing together in October 2007. The project was inspired by a song, "The Bar Room Mountaineers", that Findlay had learned from Scots singer Geordie MacIntryre while studying Traditional Music at the RSAMD in Glasgow. The story goes that with his former band Back of the Moon splitting up he needed a new project. Whilst running on Tinto Hill in South Lanarkshire he was caught in a rainstorm. Wearing nothing but shorts, T-shirt and running shoes, he bemoaned the fact that his fellow musicians were warm in Wiston Lodge below doing a bit of Bar Room Mountaineering he thought. At that moment the Bar Room Mountaineers were born.
