54.9	The_Larry_Sanders_Show	The Larry Sanders Show	The Larry Sanders Show is a satirical television sitcom that aired from August 1992 to May 1998 on the HBO cable television network in the United States. It stars stand-up comedian Garry Shandling as vain, neurotic talk show host Larry Sanders, and centered on the running of his TV show, and the many people behind the scenes. It is notable for featuring celebrities playing exaggerated, self-parodying versions of themselves, and for its character-based humor. Other series which subsequently aired on HBO, such as Curb Your Enthusiasm, Extras, and Entourage, shared these traits.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Larrysandersshowtitlecard.jpg/250px-Larrysandersshowtitlecard.jpg
