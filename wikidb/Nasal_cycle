8.27	Nasal_cycle	Nasal cycle	The nasal cycle is the alternating congestion and decongestion of the nasal cavities in humans. It is a physiological congestion of the nasal concha due to selective activation of one half of the autonomic nervous system by the hypothalamus. It should not be confused with pathological nasal congestion. The nasal cycle was first described by the German physician Richard Kayser in 1895.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Concha_nasalis.gif/220px-Concha_nasalis.gif
