107.1	Genre	Genre	Genre ( or ; from French, genre French pronunciation: , "kind" or "sort", from Latin: genus (stem gener-), Greek: genos, γένος) is the term for any category of literature or other forms of art or culture, e.g. music, and in general, any type of discourse, whether written or spoken, audial or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria. Genres are formed by conventions that change over time as new genres are invented and the use of old ones are discontinued. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/James_Matthew_Barrie00.jpg/220px-James_Matthew_Barrie00.jpg
