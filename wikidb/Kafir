53.5	Kafir	Kafir	Kafir is an Arabic term used in a Islamic doctrinal sense, usually translated as "unbeliever" or "disbeliever". The term refers to a person who rejects God or who hides, denies, or covers the "truth". Even though labeling infidelity is referred usually to Islam, it effectively belongs also to Christianity and Judaism in a way or another.
