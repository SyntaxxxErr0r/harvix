56.4	Speech	Speech	Speech is the vocalized form of human communication. It is based upon the syntactic combination of lexicals and names that are drawn from very large (usually to about 10,000 different words) vocabularies. Each spoken word is created out of the phonetic combination of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech sound units. These vocabularies, the syntax which structures them, and their set of speech sound units differ, creating the existence of many thousands of different types of mutually unintelligible human languages. Some human speakers are able to communicate in two or more of them. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also provide humans with the ability to sing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Languages_world_map-transparent_background.svg/250px-Languages_world_map-transparent_background.svg.png
