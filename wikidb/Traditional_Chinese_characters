73.2	Traditional_Chinese_characters	Traditional Chinese characters	Traditional Chinese characters (traditional Chinese: ; simplified Chinese: ; Pinyin: Fántǐzì) refers to Chinese characters in any character set which does not contain newly created characters or character substitutions performed after 1946. It most commonly refers to characters in the standardized character sets of Taiwan, of Hong Kong, or in the Kangxi Dictionary. The modern shapes of traditional Chinese characters first appeared with the emergence of the clerical script during the Han Dynasty, and have been more or less stable since the 5th century (during the Southern and Northern Dynasties.) The retronym "traditional Chinese" is used to contrast traditional characters with Simplified Chinese characters, a standardized character set introduced by the government of the People's Republic of China on Mainland China in the 1950s.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Chinese_characters_logo.jpg
