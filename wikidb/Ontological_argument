71.5	Ontological_argument	Ontological argument	An ontological argument for the existence of God (or simply ontological argument) is any one of a category of arguments for the existence of God. The exact criteria for the classification of ontological arguments are not widely agreed, but the arguments typically start with the definition of God and conclude with his necessary existence, using mostly or only a priori reasoning and little reference to empirical observation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Anselm_of_Canterbury.jpg/140px-Anselm_of_Canterbury.jpg
