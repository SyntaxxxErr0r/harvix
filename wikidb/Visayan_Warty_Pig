6.20	Visayan_Warty_Pig	Visayan Warty Pig	The Visayan Warty Pig, Sus cebifrons, is a critically endangered species of pig. The Visayan warty pig is endemic to two of the Visayan Islands in the central Philippines, and is threatened by habitat loss, food shortages and hunting - these are the leading causes of the Visayan Warty Pig's status as critically endangered. Due to the small numbers of remaining Visayan Warty Pigs in the wild, little is known of their behaviors or characteristics outside of captivity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Sus_cebifrons.jpg/225px-Sus_cebifrons.jpg
