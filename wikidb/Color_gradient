8.12	Color_gradient	Color gradient	A linear color gradient is specified by two points, and a color at each point. The colors along the line through those points are calculated using linear interpolation, then extended perpendicular to that line. In digital imaging systems, colors are typically interpolated in an RGB color space, often using gamma compressed RGB color values, as opposed to linear.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Linear-gradient.svg/120px-Linear-gradient.svg.png
