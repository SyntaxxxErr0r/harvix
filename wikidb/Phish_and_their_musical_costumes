12.21	Phish_and_their_musical_costumes	Phish tours	Musical costume is a term for the band Phish's elaborate Halloween concerts that involved the band performing an entire album by another artist and including it as the second of three sets. For the 1994 and 1995 Halloween shows, Phish fans were able to vote via newsletter for their choice in which album was to be played. Fans were invited to wear Halloween costumes and take part in costume contests and were given a "Phishbill" which identify the album and the band's relationship to it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/LivePhishHalloween.JPG
