51.4	Humanistic_psychology	Humanistic psychology	Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century, drawing on the work of early pioneers like Carl Rogers, whose focus was to ensure that the developmental processes led to healthier personality functioning. His idea of the concept of “self” plays a large role in humanistic theory where the “self” functions as a grouping of values, images, memories, behavior patterns, and especially current experiences. Rogers coined the term actualizing tendency, which is “the directional trend which is evident in all organic and human life--the urge to expand, extend, develop, mature--the tendency to express and activate all the capacities of the organism.” core concepts formed Humanistic Psychology as we know it. It also drew from the philosophies of existentialism and phenomenology. It adopts a holistic approach to human existence through investigations of meaning, values, freedom, tragedy, personal responsibility, human potential, spirituality, and self-actualization. It believes that people are inherently good.
