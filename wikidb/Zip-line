54.1	Zip-line	Zip-line	A zip-line (also known as a flying fox, foefie slide, zip wire, aerial runway, aerial ropeslide, death slide or tyrolean crossing) consists of a pulley suspended on a cable mounted on an incline. It is designed to enable a user propelled by gravity to travel from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable, usually made of stainless steel, by holding on or attaching to the freely moving pulley. Zip-lines come in many forms, most often used as a means of entertainment. They may be short and low, intended for child's play and found on some playgrounds. Longer and higher rides are often used as a means of accessing remote areas, such as a rainforest canopy. Zip-line tours are becoming popular vacation activities, found at outdoor adventure camps or upscale resorts, where they may be an element on a larger challenge or ropes course.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Zip-line_over_rainforest_canopy_4_January_2005%2C_Costa_Rica.jpg/250px-Zip-line_over_rainforest_canopy_4_January_2005%2C_Costa_Rica.jpg
