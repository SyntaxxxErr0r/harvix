Beta waves are split into three sections: Low Beta Waves (12.5-16 Hz, "Beta 1 power"); Beta Waves (16.5â€“20 Hz, "Beta 2 power"); and High Beta Waves (20.5-28 Hz, "Beta 3 power"). Beta states are the states associated with normal waking consciousness.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Eeg_beta.svg/400px-Eeg_beta.svg.png
