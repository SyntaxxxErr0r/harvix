51.6	Snipe_hunt	Snipe hunt	A snipe hunt, a form of wild-goose chase that is also known as a fool's errand, is a type of practical joke that involves experienced people making fun of credulous newcomers by giving them an impossible or imaginary task. The origin of the term is a practical joke where inexperienced campers are told about a bird or animal called the snipe as well as a usually preposterous method of catching it, such as running around the woods carrying a bag or making strange noises such as banging rocks together. Incidentally, the snipe (a family of shorebirds) is difficult to catch for experienced hunters, so much so that the word "sniper" is derived from it to refer to anyone skilled enough to shoot one.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Gallinago_gallinago_1_%28Marek_Szczepanek%29.jpg/220px-Gallinago_gallinago_1_%28Marek_Szczepanek%29.jpg
