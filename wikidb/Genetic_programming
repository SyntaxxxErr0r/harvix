80.8	Genetic_programming	Genetic programming	In artificial intelligence, genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm-based methodology inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a user-defined task. It is a specialization of genetic algorithms (GA) where each individual is a computer program. It is a machine learning technique used to optimize a population of computer programs according to a fitness landscape determined by a program's ability to perform a given computational task.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Genetic_Program_Tree.png
