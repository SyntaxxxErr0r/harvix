52.4	Star_formation	Star formation	Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular clouds, commonly referred to as "stellar nurseries", collapse into spheres of plasma to form stars. As a branch of astronomy star formation includes the study of the interstellar medium and giant molecular clouds (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process and the study of young stellar objects and planet formation as its immediate products. Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of binary stars and the initial mass function.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Heic0411a.jpg/145px-Heic0411a.jpg
