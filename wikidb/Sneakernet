132.6	Sneakernet	Sneakernet	Sneakernet is an informal term describing the transfer of electronic information, especially computer files, by physically couriering removable media such as magnetic tape, floppy disks, compact discs, USB flash drives, or external hard drives from one computer to another. This is usually in lieu of transferring the information over a computer network. The name is pronounced similar to Ethernet and is a tongue-in-cheek reference to sneakers (footwear).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/SanDisk_Cruzer_Micro.png/300px-SanDisk_Cruzer_Micro.png
