1.00	Black_on_Black	Black on Black	Black on Black is an album by Waylon Jennings, released on RCA Victor in 1982. The second Jennings record, after 1977's Ol' Waylon, to be produced by Chips Moman, who had collaborated with Willie Nelson on Always on My Mind, Nelson's most successful album, Black on Black features a different sound than most Jennings albums of the period, prominently including electric pianos and backing vocals, the latter performed primarily by Jennings' wife, Jessi Colter. One of many re-recordings of Jennings' "Just to Satisfy You", this time with Willie Nelson, hit the top of the country charts. Hank Williams' "Honky Tonk Blues" and Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues" are covered here too. The song "Song for the Life" was originally recorded by Rodney Crowell, and would later be covered by several other artists, including Alan Jackson, whose version was a Top Ten country hit in mid-1995.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/WaylonJenningsBlackonBlack.jpg/220px-WaylonJenningsBlackonBlack.jpg
