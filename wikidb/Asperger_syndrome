304.7	Asperger_syndrome	Asperger syndrome	Asperger syndrome, also known as Asperger's syndrome or Asperger disorder, is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. It differs from other autism spectrum disorders by its relative preservation of linguistic and cognitive development. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and atypical use of language are frequently reported.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Riboflavin_penicillinamide.jpg/230px-Riboflavin_penicillinamide.jpg
