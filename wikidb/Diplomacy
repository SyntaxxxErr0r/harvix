56.5	Diplomacy	Diplomacy	Diplomacy (from Latin diploma, meaning an official document, which in turn derives from the Greek , meaning a folded paper/document) is the art and practice of conducting negotiations between representatives of groups or states. It usually refers to international diplomacy, the conduct of international relations through the intercession of professional diplomats with regard to issues of peace-making, trade, war, economics, culture, environment and human rights. International treaties are usually negotiated by diplomats prior to endorsement by national politicians. In an informal or social sense, diplomacy is the employment of tact to gain strategic advantage or to find mutually acceptable solutions to a common challenge, one set of tools being the phrasing of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/United_Nations_HQ_-_New_York_City.jpg/240px-United_Nations_HQ_-_New_York_City.jpg
