54.3	Elliptical_trainer	Elliptical trainer	An elliptical trainer or cross-trainer is a stationary exercise machine used to simulate stair climbing, walking, or running without causing excessive pressure to the joints, hence decreasing the risk of impact injuries. For this reason, people with some injuries are able to use an elliptical to stay fit, as the low impact affects them little.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Elliptical_machine.jpg/220px-Elliptical_machine.jpg
