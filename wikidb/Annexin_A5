3.10	Annexin_A5	Annexin A5	Annexin A5 (or annexin V) is a cellular protein in the annexin group. The function of the protein is unknown; however, annexin A5 has been proposed to play a role in the inhibition of blood coagulation by competing for phosphatidylserine binding sites with prothrombin and also to inhibit the activity of phospholipase A1. These properties have been found by in vitro experiments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Protein_ANXA5_PDB_1a8a.png/250px-Protein_ANXA5_PDB_1a8a.png
