The bulk milk cooling tank is an important piece of dairy farm equipment. It is usually made of stainless steel and used every day to store the raw milk on the farm in good condition. It must be cleaned after each milk collection. The milk cooling tank can be the property of the farmer or be rented from a dairy plant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Bulk_milk_cooling_tank_type.png
