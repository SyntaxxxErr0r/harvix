55.3	Box_jellyfish	Box jellyfish	Box jellyfish (class Cubozoa) are cnidarian invertebrates distinguished by their cube-shaped medusae. Box jellyfish are known for the extremely potent venom produced by some species: Chironex fleckeri, Carukia barnesi and Malo kingi are among the most venomous creatures in the world. Stings from these and a few other species in the class are extremely painful and sometimes fatal to humans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Avispa_marina.jpg/150px-Avispa_marina.jpg
