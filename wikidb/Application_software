179.7	Application_software	Application software	Application software, also known as an application or an "app", is computer software designed to help the user to perform specific tasks. Examples include enterprise software, accounting software, office suites, graphics software and media players. Many application programs deal principally with documents. Apps may be bundled with the computer and its system software, or may be published separately. Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install one.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/OpenOffice.org_Writer.png/275px-OpenOffice.org_Writer.png
