216.1	Occupy_Wall_Street	Occupy Wall Street	Occupy Wall Street (OWS) is a protest movement that began September 17, 2011 in Zuccotti Park, located in New York City's Wall Street financial district. OWS was initiated by the Canadian activist group Adbusters and has led to Occupy protests and movements around the world. The OWS protests are against social and economic inequality, greed, corruption and the undue influence of corporations on governmentâ€”particularly from the financial services sector. Their slogan, We are the 99%, addresses the growing income inequality and wealth distribution in the U.S. between the wealthiest 1% and the rest of the population. To effect change OWS engages in "direct action" instead of petitioning authorities.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/57/Wall-Street-1.jpg/200px-Wall-Street-1.jpg
