For the exhibition, an entire house was built that the American exhibitors claimed anyone in America could afford. It was filled with labor-saving and recreational devices meant to represent the fruits of the capitalist American consumer market. The debate was recorded on color videotape, a new technology pioneered in the U.S., and Nixon made reference to this fact; it was subsequently rebroadcast in both countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Kitchen_debate.jpg/300px-Kitchen_debate.jpg
