It is located at 9 Nicholson Street in the Carlton Gardens, flanked by Victoria, Nicholson, Carlton and Rathdowne Streets, at the north-eastern edge of the central business district. It was built to host the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880-1881 and later hosted the opening of the first Parliament of Australia in 1901. Throughout the 20th century smaller sections and wings of the building were subject to demolition and fire, however the main building, known as the Great Hall, survived.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Royal_exhibition_building_tulips_straight.jpg/250px-Royal_exhibition_building_tulips_straight.jpg
