It combines an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU with a PowerVR GPU, and emphasizes power efficiency. The chip commercially debuted with the release of Apple's iPad tablet; followed shortly by the iPhone 4 smartphone, the 4th generation iPod Touch and the 2nd generation Apple TV. It was superseded in the second-generation iPad by the Apple A5 processor, released the following year, which was then subsequently replaced by the Apple A5X processor in the third generation iPad.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Apple_A4_Chip.jpg/144px-Apple_A4_Chip.jpg
