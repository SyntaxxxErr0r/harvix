55.4	Catenary	Catenary	In physics and geometry, the catenary is the curve that an idealized hanging cable or chain with very short links assumes under its own weight when supported only at its ends. The curve has a U-like shape, superficially similar in appearance to a parabola (though mathematically quite different). It also appears in the design of certain types of arches and as a cross section of the shape assumed by a soap film bounded by two parallel circular rings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Kette_Kettenkurve_Catenary_2008_PD.JPG/180px-Kette_Kettenkurve_Catenary_2008_PD.JPG
