71.5	Chicago_(band)	Chicago (band)	Chicago is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois. The self-described "rock and roll band with horns" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, becoming famous for producing a number of hit ballads. They had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Second only to The Beach Boys in terms of Billboard singles and albums chart success among American bands, Chicago is one of the longest running and most successful pop/rock and roll groups.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Chicagothebandmillbrook_lar.jpg/300px-Chicagothebandmillbrook_lar.jpg
