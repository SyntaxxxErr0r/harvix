59.5	Sedimentary_rock	Sedimentary rock	Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition of material at the Earth's surface and within bodies of water. Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral and/or organic particles to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a solution. Particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment. Before being deposited, sediment was formed by weathering and erosion in a source area, and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, mass movement or glaciers which are called agents of denudation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Triassic_Utah.JPG/220px-Triassic_Utah.JPG
