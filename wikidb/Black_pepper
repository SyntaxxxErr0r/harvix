109.1	Black_pepper	Black pepper	Black pepper is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning. The fruit, known as a peppercorn when dried, is approximately 5 millimetres (0.20 in) in diameter, dark red when fully mature, and, like all drupes, contains a single seed. Peppercorns, and the powdered pepper derived from grinding them, may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit) and white pepper (dried ripe seeds).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Piper_nigrum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-107.jpg/220px-Piper_nigrum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-107.jpg
