10.22	CFIT	Controlled flight into terrain	Controlled flight into terrain describes an accident in which an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, is unintentionally flown into the ground, a mountain, water, or an obstacle. The term was coined by engineers at Boeing in the late 1970s. The pilots are generally unaware of the danger until it is too late.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Air_New_Zealand_Flight_901.jpg/220px-Air_New_Zealand_Flight_901.jpg
