72.3	Caldera	Caldera	A caldera is a cauldron-like volcanic feature usually formed by the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption. They are sometimes confused with volcanic craters. The word comes from Spanish caldera, and this from Latin CALDARIA, meaning "cooking pot." In some texts the English term cauldron is also used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Mount_Mazama_eruption_timeline.PNG/220px-Mount_Mazama_eruption_timeline.PNG
