3.00	Stockholmsnatt	Stockholmsnatt	Stockholmsnatt (English: Stockholm Night or The King of Kungsan) is a 1987 Swedish drama film directed by Staffan Hildebrand. The film is loosely based on a true story about Paolo Roberto, later a professional boxer and TV presenter. Because of his Italian roots, Paolo is dealing with an identity crisis. With an admiration of kung fu films and with his teenage aggressions, the kung fu films have a negative impact on him, which tempts him to practice violence on innocent citizens in Stockholm.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Stockholmsnatt.jpg/220px-Stockholmsnatt.jpg
