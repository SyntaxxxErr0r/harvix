52.2	Larrabee_(GPU)	Larrabee (microarchitecture)	Larrabee is the codename for a GPGPU chip that Intel is developing separately from its current line of integrated graphics accelerators. The chip was to be released in 2010 as the core of a consumer 3D graphics card, but these plans were cancelled due to delays and disappointing early performance figures. The project to produce a GPU retail product directly from the Larrabee research project was terminated in May 2010. The Intel MIC multiprocessor architecture announced in 2010 inherited many design elements from the Larrabee project, but does not function as a graphics processing unit; the product is intended as a co-processor for high performance computing.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Larrabee_slide_block_diagram.jpg/220px-Larrabee_slide_block_diagram.jpg
