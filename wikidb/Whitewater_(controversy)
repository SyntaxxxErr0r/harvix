33.06	Whitewater_(controversy)	Whitewater controversy	Bill Clinton had known Arkansas businessman and political figure Jim McDougal since 1968, and had made a previous small real estate investment with him in 1977. Clinton and Hillary Rodham were seeking ways of supplementing his salary of $26,500 as Arkansas Attorney General (which would rise to $35,000 if his campaign for Governor of Arkansas succeeded) and hers of $24,500 as Rose Law Firm associate. It was around this time that Rodham also began her cattle futures trading.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/HillaryRodhamBillClintonLittleRockHouse1.jpg/223px-HillaryRodhamBillClintonLittleRockHouse1.jpg
