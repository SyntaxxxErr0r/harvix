1.31	Meet_the_Austins	Meet the Austins	Meet the Austins is the title of a 1960 novel by Madeleine L'Engle, the first of her books about the Austin family. It introduces the characters Vicky Austin and her three siblings, and Maggy Hamilton, an orphan. Vicky's noisy, loving, mostly-happy family is disrupted by the arrival of Maggy, a spoiled, troubled only child who had very little family life even before her father died in a plane crash. Maggy encourages Vicky's sister Suzy to misbehave, which in turn makes Vicky's life difficult as she tries to restore order. The book is largely episodic, with each chapter covering a specific incident such as Vicky's bicycle accident or a family vacation. Although Vicky will later appear in three novels that have fantasy and/or science fiction themes, there are no such elements in Meet the Austins.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a6/Meettheaustins.jpg/200px-Meettheaustins.jpg
