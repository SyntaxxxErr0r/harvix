1.10	%C3%86thelnoth_(archbishop_of_Canterbury)	Æthelnoth (archbishop of Canterbury)	Æthelnoth (also Ethelnoth, Ednoth, or Eadnodus; died 1038) was a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury. Descended from an earlier English king, Æthelnoth became a monk prior to becoming archbishop. While archbishop, he traveled to Rome and brought back saint's relics. He consecrated a number of other bishops who came from outside his archdiocese, leading to some friction with other archbishops. Although he was regarded as a saint after his death, there is little evidence of his veneration or of a cult in Canterbury or elsewhere.
