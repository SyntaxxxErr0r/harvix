3.40	I'll_Be_Lovin'_U_Long_Time	I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time	"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, taken from her eleventh studio album, E=MCÂ² (2008). It was written by Carey, Aldrin Davis, Crystal Johnson and Clifford Harris, and produced by the former two. As the song's hook and instrumentation is derived from sampling Mark DeBarge's "Stay With Me", the former and Etterlene Jordan also share songwriting credits. "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" was released as the album's third single in the United States, Australasia and select European countries on July 1, 2008. Drawing influence from pop, soul and R&amp;B music genres, and featuring a piano and keyboard-driven melody, the song's lyrics demonstrate the lengths the protagonist will go for her lover, and how she will be 'lovin' him long time'.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b1/Mariah_Carey_-_I%27ll_Be_Lovin%27_U_Long_Time.jpg/220px-Mariah_Carey_-_I%27ll_Be_Lovin%27_U_Long_Time.jpg
