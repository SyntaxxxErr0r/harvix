70.1	Telemedicine	Telemedicine	Telemedicine is the use of telecommunication and information technologies in order to provide clinical health care at a distance. It helps eliminate distance barriers and can improve access to medical services that would often not be consistently available in distant rural communities. It is also used to save lives in critical care and emergency situations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/US_Navy_060518-N-2832L-013_Senior_training_specialist_with_Multi-Services_Group_International_%28MSGI%29%2C_Michael_Bedwell%2C_trains_Sailors_to_use_Battlefield_Medical_Information_Systems_Telemedicine_%28BMIST%29_equipped_Personal_Digital.jpg/220px-US_Navy_060518-N-2832L-013_Senior_training_specialist_with_Multi-Services_Group_International_%28MSGI%29%2C_Michael_Bedwell%2C_trains_Sailors_to_use_Battlefield_Medical_Information_Systems_Telemedicine_%28BMIST%29_equipped_Personal_Digital.jpg
