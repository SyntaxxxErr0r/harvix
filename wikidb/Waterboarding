242.4	Waterboarding	Waterboarding	Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over the face of an immobilized captive, thus causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. Waterboarding can cause extreme pain, dry drowning, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, other physical injuries including broken bones due to struggling against restraints, lasting psychological damage and death. Adverse physical consequences can manifest themselves months after the event, while psychological effects can last for years. The term water board torture appears in press reports as early as 1976.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d5/Waterboard3-small.jpg/250px-Waterboard3-small.jpg
