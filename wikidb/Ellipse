71.3	Ellipse	Ellipse	In mathematics, an ellipse (from Greek ἔλλειψις elleipsis, a "falling short") is a plane curve that results from the intersection of a cone by a plane in a way that produces a closed curve. Circles are special cases of ellipses, obtained when the cutting plane is orthogonal to the cone's axis. An ellipse is also the locus of all points of the plane whose distances to two fixed points add to the same constant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Conicas1.PNG/220px-Conicas1.PNG
