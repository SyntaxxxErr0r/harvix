86.6	Virgin_Killer	Virgin Killer	Virgin Killer is the fourth studio album by the German heavy metal band Scorpions. It was released in 1976 and was the first album of the band to attract attention outside Europe. The title is described as being a reference to time as the killer of innocence. The original cover featured a nude prepubescent girl, which stirred controversy in the U.K., U.S. and elsewhere. As a result, the album was re-issued with a different cover in some countries.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/33/Virgin_Killer.jpg/220px-Virgin_Killer.jpg
