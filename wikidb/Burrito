55.4	Burrito	Burrito	A burrito , or taco de harina, is a type of Mexican food. It consists of a wheat flour tortilla wrapped or folded into a roughly cylindrical shape to completely enclose a filling. (In contrast, a taco is generally formed by simply folding a tortilla in half around a filling, leaving the semicircular perimeter open.) The flour tortilla is usually lightly grilled or steamed, to soften it and make it more pliable.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Papa_chevos_burrito.jpg/220px-Papa_chevos_burrito.jpg
