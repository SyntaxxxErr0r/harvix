154.7	Bloomsday	Bloomsday	Bloomsday is a commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish writer James Joyce during which the events of his novel Ulysses (which is set on 16 June 1904) are relived. It is observed annually on 16 June in Dublin and elsewhere. Joyce chose the date as it was the date of his first outing with his wife-to-be, Nora Barnacle; they walked to the Dublin suburb of Ringsend. The name derives from Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Ulysses.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/BloomsdayDavyByrnes.jpg/300px-BloomsdayDavyByrnes.jpg
