163.5	Omega-3_fatty_acid	Omega-3 fatty acid	N−3 fatty acids that are important in human physiology are α-linolenic acid (18:3, n−3; ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, n−3; EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n−3; DHA). These three polyunsaturates have either 3, 5, or 6 double bonds in a carbon chain of 18, 20, or 22 carbon atoms, respectively. As with most naturally-produced fatty acids, all double bonds are in the cis-configuration; in other words, the two hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/ALAnumbering.svg/360px-ALAnumbering.svg.png
