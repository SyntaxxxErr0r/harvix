1.00	Nudie-cutie	Nudity in film	Nudity in film is any presentation in motion pictures of people while naked or wearing less clothing than contemporary norms consider modest. Many actors and actresses have appeared nude, or exposing parts of their bodies or dressed in ways considered provocative by contemporary standards at some point in their careers. Most nude scenes have been justified as being part of the story, in the concept of "artistically justifiable nudity," while other nudity has been viewed as "superfluous" or "gratuitous".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/AudreyMunsonInspiration.jpg/220px-AudreyMunsonInspiration.jpg
