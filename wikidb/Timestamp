32.84	Timestamp	Timestamp	A timestamp is a sequence of characters, denoting the date or time at which a certain event occurred. The term refers to rubber stamps that are used in offices to stamp the current date and time in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received. A common example of this type of timestamp is a postmark on a letter. However, in modern times its usage has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to data stored in a computer or digital electronic equipment. For example, computer files contain timestamps that tell when the file was created and last modified, and digital cameras add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Timestamp.png/220px-Timestamp.png
