77.8	Hasidic_Judaism	Hasidic Judaism	Hasidic Judaism or Hasidism, from the Hebrew: ‎—Ḥasidut (IPA: ) in Sephardi Hebrew, Chasidus (IPA: ) in Ashkenazi Hebrew, meaning "piety" (literally "loving kindness"), is a branch of Orthodox Judaism that promotes spirituality and joy through the popularisation and internalisation of Jewish mysticism as the fundamental aspects of the Jewish faith. It was founded in 18th century Eastern Europe by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov as a reaction against overly legalistic Judaism. His example began the characteristic veneration of leadership in Hasidism as embodiments and intercessors of Divinity for the followers. Opposite to this, Hasidic teachings cherished the sincerity and concealed holiness of the unlettered common folk, and their equality with the scholarly elite. The emphasis on the Immanent Divine presence in everything gave new value to prayer and deeds of kindness, alongside Rabbinic supremacy of study, and replaced historical mystical (kabbalistic) and ethical (musar) asceticism and admonishment with optimism, encouragement, and daily fervour. This populist emotional revival accompanied the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine Panentheism, through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of mystical thought. The adjustment of Jewish values sought to add to required standards of ritual observance, while relaxing others where inspiration predominated. Its communal gatherings celebrated soulful song and storytelling as forms of mystical devotion.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Gottlieb-Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg/210px-Gottlieb-Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg
