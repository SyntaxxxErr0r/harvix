It has several subspecies. It has a heart-shaped face with earlike extensions. The Congo Bay Owl (Phodilus prigoginei) was formerly classified as a subspecies of Oriental Bay Owl due to insufficient knowledge, but it has turned out that it might not even belong to the same genus.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/BayOwlGould.jpg/220px-BayOwlGould.jpg
