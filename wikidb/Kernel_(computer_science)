97.7	Kernel_(computer_science)	Kernel (computing)	In computing, the kernel is the main component of most computer operating systems; it is a bridge between applications and the actual data processing done at the hardware level. The kernel's responsibilities include managing the system's resources (the communication between hardware and software components). Usually as a basic component of an operating system, a kernel can provide the lowest-level abstraction layer for the resources (especially processors and I/O devices) that application software must control to perform its function. It typically makes these facilities available to application processes through inter-process communication mechanisms and system calls.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Kernel_Layout.svg/220px-Kernel_Layout.svg.png
