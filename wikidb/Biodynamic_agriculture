168.6	Biodynamic_agriculture	Biodynamic agriculture	Biodynamic agriculture is a method of organic farming that emphasizes the holistic development and interrelationships of the soil, plants and animals as a self-sustaining system. Biodynamic farming has much in common with other organic approaches, such as emphasizing the use of manures and composts and excluding of the use of artificial chemicals on soil and plants. There are independent certification agencies for biodynamic products; most of these agencies are members of the international biodynamics standards group Demeter International. Biodynamics originated out of the work of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/RegaderaMetalica.jpg/100px-RegaderaMetalica.jpg
