1.00	National_laboratories	United States Department of Energy National Laboratories	The United States Department of Energy National Laboratories and Technology Centers are a system of facilities and laboratories overseen by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) for the purpose of advancing science and helping promote the economic and defensive national interests of the United States of America. Most of the DOE national laboratories are actually federally funded research and development centers administered, managed, operated and staffed by private corporations and academic universities under contract to DOE. The 2005 NASA Authorization Act designated the U.S. segment of the International Space Station as a national laboratory with a goal to increase the utilization of the ISS by other Federal entities and the private sector.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/US-DeptOfEnergy-Seal.svg/220px-US-DeptOfEnergy-Seal.svg.png
