7.10	HAIPE	High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor	A HAIPE (High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor) is a Type 1 encryption device that complies with the National Security Agency's HAIPE IS (formerly the HAIPIS, the High Assurance Internet Protocol Interoperability Specification). The cryptography used is Suite A and Suite B, also specified by the NSA as part of the Cryptographic Modernization Program. HAIPE IS is based on IPsec with additional restrictions and enhancements. One of these enhancements includes the ability to encrypt multicast data using a "preplaced key" (see definition in List of cryptographic key types). This requires loading the same key on all HAIPE devices that will participate in the multicast session in advance of data transmission. A HAIPE is typically a secure gateway that allows two enclaves to exchange data over an untrusted or lower-classification network.
