62.3	Antique	Antique	An antique (Latin: ; old) is an old collectable item. It is collected or desirable because of its age (see definition), beauty, rarity, condition, utility, personal emotional connection, and/or other unique features. It is an object that represents a previous era or time period in human society. It is common practice to define "antique", as applying to objects at least 100 years old. Collectibles are, generally speaking, the possible antiques of the future and generally less than 100 years old.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Kepler-world.jpg/300px-Kepler-world.jpg
