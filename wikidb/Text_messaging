178.1	Text_messaging	Text messaging	Text messaging, or texting, refers to the exchange of brief written text messages between two mobile phones and/or fixed or portable devices over a network. While the original term (see below) was derived from referring to messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS) originated from Radio Telegraphy, it has since been extended to include messages containing image, video, and sound content (known as MMS messages). The sender of a text message is known as a texter, while the service itself has different colloquialisms depending on the region: it may simply be referred to as a text in North America, India, Australia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom, an SMS in most of Europe, and a TMS or SMS in the Middle East and Asia.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Texting.jpg/200px-Texting.jpg
