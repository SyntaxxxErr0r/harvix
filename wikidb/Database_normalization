177.6	Database_normalization	Database normalization	Database normalization is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency. Normalization usually involves dividing large tables into smaller (and less redundant) tables and defining relationships between them. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of a field can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database via the defined relationships.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Update_anomaly.png/280px-Update_anomaly.png
