6.33	1692_Jamaica_earthquake	1692 Jamaica earthquake	The 1692 Jamaica earthquake struck Port Royal, Jamaica on June 7, at exactly 11:43 a.m., according to a stopped pocket watch found in the harbour in the 1950s. Port Royal was then the unofficial capital of Jamaica, and one of the busiest and wealthiest ports in the West Indies. It was known both as the "storehouse and treasury of the West Indies" and "one of the wickedest places on earth", being a common home port for the many privateers and pirates operating within the Caribbean. The earthquake caused most of the city to sink below sea level and about 2,000 people died as a result of the earthquake and the following tsunami. About 3000 people died in the days following the earthquakes due to injuries and disease.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Jamaica_location_map.svg/250px-Jamaica_location_map.svg.png
