18.14	Vere_Gordon_Childe	V. Gordon Childe	Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 â€“ 19 October 1957), better known as V. Gordon Childe, was an Australian archaeologist and philologist who specialised in the study of European prehistory. A vocal socialist, Childe accepted the socio-economic theory of Marxism and was an early, though unorthodox, proponent of Marxist archaeology. Childe worked for most of his life as an academic in the United Kingdom, initially at the University of Edinburgh, and later at the Institute of Archaeology, London. He also wrote a number of groundbreaking books on the subject of archaeology and prehistory, most notably Man Makes Himself (1936) and What Happened in History (1942).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Gordon_Childe.jpg/200px-Gordon_Childe.jpg
