57.1	Natural_and_legal_rights	Natural and legal rights	Natural and legal rights are two types of rights theoretically distinct according to philosophers and political scientists. Natural rights are rights not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable. In contrast, legal rights are those bestowed onto a person by the law of a particular political and legal system, and therefore relative to specific cultures and governments.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/John_Locke_by_Herman_Verelst.jpg/150px-John_Locke_by_Herman_Verelst.jpg
