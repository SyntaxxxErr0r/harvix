125.6	Victory_garden	Victory garden	Victory gardens, also called war gardens or food gardens for defense, were vegetable, fruit and herb gardens planted at private residences and public parks in United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany during World War I and World War II to reduce the pressure on the public food supply brought on by the war effort. In addition to indirectly aiding the war effort these gardens were also considered a civil "morale booster" â€” in that gardeners could feel empowered by their contribution of labor and rewarded by the produce grown. This made victory gardens become a part of daily life on the home front.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Victory-garden.jpg/220px-Victory-garden.jpg
