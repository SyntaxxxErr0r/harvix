77.8	Brahman	Brahman	In Hinduism, Brahman is the unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe; that is the one supreme, universal spirit. Brahman is sometimes referred to as the Absolute or Godhead which is the Divine Ground of all being. Brahman is conceived as personal ("with qualities"), impersonal ("without qualities") and/or supreme depending on the philosophical school.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Wassertropfen.jpg/300px-Wassertropfen.jpg
