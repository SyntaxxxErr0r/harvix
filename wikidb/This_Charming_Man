It was released as the group's second single in October 1983 on the independent record label Rough Trade. The song is defined by Marr's jangle pop guitar riff and Morrissey's characteristically morose lyrics, which revolve around the recurrent Smiths themes of sexual ambiguity and lust.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Thischarmingmansingle.PNG/220px-Thischarmingmansingle.PNG
