320.1	Entropy	Entropy	Entropy is a thermodynamic property that can be used to determine the energy not available for work in a thermodynamic process, such as in energy conversion devices, engines, or machines. Such devices can only be driven by convertible energy, and have a theoretical maximum efficiency when converting energy to work. During this work, entropy accumulates in the system, which then dissipates in the form of waste heat.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Ice_water.jpg/220px-Ice_water.jpg
