1.00	Whig_Junto	Whig Junto	The Whig Junto is the name given to a group of leading Whigs who were seen to direct the management of the Whig party and often the government, during the reigns of William III and Anne. The Whig Junto proper consisted of John Somers, later Baron Somers; Charles Montagu, later Earl of Halifax; Thomas Wharton, later Marquess of Wharton and Edward Russell, later Earl of Orford. They came to prominence due to the favour of Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland and during the reign of Queen Anne, Sunderland's son, the 3rd Earl joined their ranks. Other figures prominent around the edges of the Junto include Sir John Trenchard and Thomas Tollemache.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/John_Somers%2C_Baron_Somers_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller%2C_Bt_lowres_color.jpg/100px-John_Somers%2C_Baron_Somers_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller%2C_Bt_lowres_color.jpg
