4.00	Compose_Key	Compose key	A compose key, available on some computer keyboards, is a special kind of modifier key designated to signal the software to interpret the following sequence of two (or more) keystrokes as a combination in order to produce a character not found directly on the keyboard. For example, striking Compose followed by A and then E may produce the ligature æ, whereas striking Compose followed by O and then C can yield © (circled C, the copyright symbol).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Compose_key_on_Sun_Type_5c_keyboard.jpg/220px-Compose_key_on_Sun_Type_5c_keyboard.jpg
