1.10	Economic_history_of_China_(Pre-1911)	Economic history of China before 1912	The economic history of China stretches over thousands of years and has undergone alternating cycles of prosperity and decline. According to the book 'China and the Knowledge Economy: Seizing the 21st century', China was for a large part of the last two millennia the world's largest economy, even though its wealth remained average. China's history is usually divided into three periods: The pre-imperial era, consisting of the era of before the unification of Qin, the early imperial era from Qin to Song, and the late imperial era, marked by the economic revolution that occurred during the Song Dynasty.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Golden_canteen_with_dragon%2C_Ming_Dynasty.jpg/300px-Golden_canteen_with_dragon%2C_Ming_Dynasty.jpg
