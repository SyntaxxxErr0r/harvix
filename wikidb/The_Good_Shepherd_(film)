Although it is a fictional film loosely based on real events, it is advertised as telling the untold story of the birth of counter-intelligence in the Central Intelligence Agency. The film's main character, Edward Wilson (portrayed by Matt Damon), is loosely based on James Jesus Angleton and Richard M. Bissell. This was Joe Pesci's first film appearance after his six year hiatus from acting between 1999 and 2005.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/GoodShepherdBigPoster.jpg/220px-GoodShepherdBigPoster.jpg
