4.73	Architecture_of_Texas	Architecture of Texas	The first European buildings in Texas were a series of religious Spanish Missions build by established by Catholic Dominicans, Jesuits, and Franciscans to spread the Christian doctrine among the local Native Americans, and to give Spain a toehold in the frontier land. The missions introduced European livestock, fruits, vegetables, and industry into the Texas region. In addition to the presidio (fort) and pueblo (town), the misi√≥n was one of the three major agencies employed by the Spanish crown to extend its borders and consolidate its colonial territories. In all, twenty-six missions were maintained for different lengths of time within the future boundaries of the state. The San Antonio de Valero Mission known for the Battle of the Alamo is a prime example of this kind of architecture.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Mission_San_Antonio_aka_Alamo.jpg/220px-Mission_San_Antonio_aka_Alamo.jpg
