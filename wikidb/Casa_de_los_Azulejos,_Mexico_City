7.11	Casa_de_los_Azulejos,_Mexico_City	Casa de los Azulejos, Mexico City	The Casa de los Azulejos or "House of Tiles" is an 18th century palace in Mexico City, built by the Count del Valle de Orizaba family. What makes this palace, in the City of Palaces, distinctive is that its facade on three sides is completely covered in the expensive blue and white tile of Puebla state. The palace remained in private hands until near the end of the 19th century. It changed hands several times before being bought by the Sanborns brothers who expanded their soda fountain/drugstore business into one of the best-recognized restaurant chains in Mexico. The house today serves as their flagship restaurant.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Casa_de_los_azulejos.jpg/300px-Casa_de_los_azulejos.jpg
