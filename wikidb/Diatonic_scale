53.63	Diatonic_scale	Diatonic scale	In music theory, a diatonic scale (from the Greek διατονικός, meaning " through tones", also known as the heptatonic prima) is a seven note, octave-repeating musical scale comprising five whole steps and two half steps for each octave, in which the two half steps are separated from each other by either two or three whole steps. This pattern ensures that, in a diatonic scale spanning more than one octave, all the half steps are maximally separated from each other (i.e. separated by at least two whole steps).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Diatonic_scale_on_C.png/330px-Diatonic_scale_on_C.png
