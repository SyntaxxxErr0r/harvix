4.00	Down_With_Love	Down with Love	Down with Love is a 2003 romantic comedy film directed by Peyton Reed and written by Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake. It stars Ren√©e Zellweger and Ewan McGregor, and is an affectionate pastiche of the romantic comedies of the early 1960s starring Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Tony Randall such as Pillow Talk and Lover Come Back. Randall played the third lead in all three Day-Hudson films and appears in a small role in Down With Love as the owner of Novak's publishing house as a homage and a connection to the previous films; it was to be his final performance. The film also features David Hyde Pierce (playing the typical Randall role as the somewhat nerdy best friend), Sarah Paulson, Rachel Dratch and Jeri Ryan in supporting roles.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/Down_with_Love.jpg/220px-Down_with_Love.jpg
