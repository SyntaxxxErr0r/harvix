Cher again collaborated with Snuff Garrett as a record producer, and with Al Capps for the arrangements. Dark Lady was the third and final studio album for MCA. It was also the last record promoted on her successful The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour show. After its release, the album received positive reviews from critics but, unlike her previous record produced by Garrett, was only moderately successful.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/39/Chercovdarklady.jpg/220px-Chercovdarklady.jpg
