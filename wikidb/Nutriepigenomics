1.00	Nutriepigenomics	Nutriepigenomics	Protein-restriction in the F0 generation led to hypomethylation of promoters involved in metabolism in the F1 and F2 generations, even though the F1 pregnant rat was given a normal diet. The exact mechanism of this situation has yet to be elucidated; however, direct transmission is a distinct possibility, meaning the epigenetic marks were preserved during spermatogenesis and oogenesis, when they are normally erased.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Histones.jpg/220px-Histones.jpg
