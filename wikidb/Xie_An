1.02	Xie_An	Xie An	Xie An (謝安) (320–385), courtesy name Anshi (安石), formally Duke Wenjing of Luling (廬陵文靖公), was a Jin Dynasty (265-420) statesman who, despite his lack of military ability, led Jin through a major crisis—attacks by Former Qin. His line became one of the two most honored during the subsequent Southern Dynasties -- the other being Wang Dao's line—and in the minds of the people no less honored than imperial clans.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Statue_of_xie_an.JPG/200px-Statue_of_xie_an.JPG
