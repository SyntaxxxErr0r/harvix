63.7	Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), also known as poly-aromatic hydrocarbons or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, are potent atmospheric pollutants that consist of fused aromatic rings and do not contain heteroatoms or carry substituents. Naphthalene is the simplest example of a PAH. PAHs occur in oil, coal, and tar deposits, and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning (whether fossil fuel or biomass). As a pollutant, they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic. PAHs are also found in cooked foods. Studies have shown that high levels of PAHs are found, for example, in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing, and in smoked fish.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Polycyclic_Aromatic_Hydrocarbons.png/220px-Polycyclic_Aromatic_Hydrocarbons.png
