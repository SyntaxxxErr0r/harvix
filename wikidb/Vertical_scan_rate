1.00	Vertical_scan_rate	Refresh rate	The refresh rate (most commonly the "vertical refresh rate", "vertical scan rate" for CRTs) is the number of times in a second that a display hardware draws the data. This is distinct from the measure of frame rate in that the refresh rate includes the repeated drawing of identical frames, while frame rate measures how often a video source can feed an entire frame of new data to a display.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Refresh_scan.jpg/220px-Refresh_scan.jpg
