55.7	Jain	Jainism	Jainism (Sanskrit: - , Tamil: - Samaá¹‡am), is an Indian religion that prescribes a path of non-violence towards all living beings. Its philosophy and practice emphasize the necessity of self-effort to move the soul towards divine consciousness and liberation. Any soul that has conquered its own inner enemies and achieved the state of supreme being is called a jina ("conqueror" or "victor"). The ultimate status of these perfect souls is called siddha. Ancient texts also refer to Jainism as shramana dharma (self-reliant) or the "path of the niganthas" (those without attachments or aversions).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Jain_Prateek_Chihna.jpg
