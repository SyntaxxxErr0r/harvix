1.00	Misto_Yellow-finch	Grassland Yellow-finch	The Grassland Yellow Finch, Sicalis luteola, is a small passerine bird. Despite its name, it is not a finch, but is a seedeater. These were formerly united with the buntings and American sparrows in the Emberizidae, but are now known to be tanagers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Sicalis_luteola.jpg/220px-Sicalis_luteola.jpg
