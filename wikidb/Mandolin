62.5	Mandolin	Mandolin	A mandolin (Italian: ) is a musical instrument in the lute family (plucked, or strummed). It descends from the mandore, a soprano member of the lute family. The mandolin soundboard (the top) comes in many shapesâ€”but generally round or teardrop-shaped, sometimes with scrolls or other projections. A mandolin may have f-holes, or a single round or oval sound hole. A round or oval sound hole may be bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling, but usually does not feature an intricately carved grille like a Baroque era mandolin.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/GlennF5top.jpg/132px-GlennF5top.jpg
