1.00	Debarring	Social rejection	Social rejection occurs when an individual is deliberately excluded from a social relationship or social interaction. The topic includes both interpersonal rejection (or peer rejection) and romantic rejection. A person can be rejected on an individual basis or by an entire group of people. Furthermore, rejection can be either active, by bullying, teasing, or ridiculing, or passive, by ignoring a person, or giving the "silent treatment." The experience of being rejected is subjective for the recipient, and it can be perceived when it is not actually present. The word "ostracism" is often used for the process (in Ancient Greece ostracism was voting into temporary exile).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Admonitions_Scroll_Scene_10.jpg/300px-Admonitions_Scroll_Scene_10.jpg
