70.6	Positive_feedback	Positive feedback	Positive feedback is a process in which the effects of a small disturbance on (a perturbation of) a system include an increase in the magnitude of the perturbation. That is, A produces more of B which in turn produces more of A. In contrast, a system that responds to a perturbation in a way that reduces its effect is said to exhibit negative feedback. These concepts were first recognized as broadly applicable by Norbert Wiener in his 1948 work on cybernetics.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Ideal_feedback_model.svg/220px-Ideal_feedback_model.svg.png
