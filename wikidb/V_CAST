4.21	V_CAST	V Cast	V CAST is a 3G EV-DO network created by Verizon Wireless to deliver audio, video, and entertainment content. The typical download speed is between 800 kilobits and 1.4 megabits per second with burst speeds of up to 3.1 megabits per second. V CAST provides music downloads and streaming video clips, which can be saved to the phone or a removable memory card, though they cannot be read by other phones or computers, since they are heavily protected by digital rights management software based on Windows Media Video 9 and developed by PacketVideo . There is buffering before the video stream is played and possibly during video playback, depending on the quality of the connection. V CAST is implemented as a permanently installed BREW application on a V CAST compatible phone.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/Verizon-v-cast.jpg
