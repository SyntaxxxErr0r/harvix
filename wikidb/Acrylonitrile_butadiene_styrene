88.8	Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene	Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene	Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (chemical formula (C8H8)x· (C4H6)y·(C3H3N)z) is a common thermoplastic. Its glass transition temperature (ABS is amorphous and therefore has no true melting point) is approximately 105 °C (221 °F).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/ABS_resin_formula.PNG/200px-ABS_resin_formula.PNG
