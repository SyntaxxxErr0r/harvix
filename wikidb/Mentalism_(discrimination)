6.70	Mentalism_(discrimination)	Mentalism (discrimination)	Mentalism, also known as sanism, is a form of discrimination and oppression against someone because of a mental trait or condition they have, or are judged to have. This may or may not be described in terms of mental disorder, mental illness or disability. The discrimination could be based on stereotypes about individual differences or conditions (e.g. ADHD, bipolar, schizophrenia, personality disorder diagnoses), specific behavioral phenomena (e.g. stuttering, tics), or supposed intelligence, or neurology (e.g. neurodiversity on the autism spectrum).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Label_for_property_of_dept_of_mental_hygiene.png/220px-Label_for_property_of_dept_of_mental_hygiene.png
