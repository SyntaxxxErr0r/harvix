6.20	The_Flying_Inn	The Flying Inn	The Flying Inn is a novel first published in 1914 by G. K. Chesterton. It is set in a future England where the Temperance movement has allowed a bizarre form of "Progressive" Islam to dominate the political and social life of the country. Because of this, alcohol sales are effectively prohibited. The plot centres on the adventures of Humphrey Pump and Captain Patrick Dalroy, who roam the country in their cart with a barrel of rum in an attempt to evade Prohibition, exploiting loopholes in the law to temporarily prevent the police taking action against them. Eventually the heroes and their followers foil an attempted coup by an Islamic military force.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/TheFlyingInn.jpg/180px-TheFlyingInn.jpg
