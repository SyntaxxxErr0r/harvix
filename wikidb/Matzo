83.6	Matzo	Matzo	Matzo or matzah is an unleavened bread traditionally eaten by Jews during the week-long Passover holiday, when eating chametz—bread and other food which is made with leavened grain—is forbidden according to Jewish law. Currently, the most ubiquitous type of matzo is the traditional Ashkenazic type, which is hard like a cracker. However, some Mizrahi Jews have traditionally prepared matzo as a soft and pliable type of flat bread, and these "soft matzos" have recently regained some popularity. Matzo is eaten by Jews as an obligation during the Passover Seder meal; during the rest of the holiday its consumption is optional, though customary, as only unleavened bread may be eaten.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Hand-baked_shmurah_matza.jpg/200px-Hand-baked_shmurah_matza.jpg
