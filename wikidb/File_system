132.2	File_system	File system	A file system (or filesystem) is a means to organize data expected to be retained after a program terminates by providing procedures to store, retrieve and update data, as well as manage the available space on the device(s) which contain it. A file system organizes data in an efficient manner and is tuned to the specific characteristics of the device. A tight coupling usually exists between the operating system and the file system. Some filesystems provide mechanisms to control access to the data and metadata. Ensuring reliability is a major responsibility of a filesystem. Some filesystems allow multiple programs to update the same file at nearly the same time.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/100_000-files_5-bytes_each_--_400_megs_of_slack_space.png
