81.5	Penrose_tiling	Penrose tiling	A Penrose tiling is a non-periodic tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of the Penrose prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a Penrose tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry, as in the diagram at the right.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Penrose_Tiling_%28Rhombi%29.svg/250px-Penrose_Tiling_%28Rhombi%29.svg.png
