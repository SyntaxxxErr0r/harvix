78.6	Pancreas	Pancreas	The pancreas is a gland organ in the digestive and endocrine system of vertebrates. It is both an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, and a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist the absorption of nutrients and the digestion in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Illu_pancrease.svg/250px-Illu_pancrease.svg.png
