12.31	Minnesota_National_Guard	Minnesota National Guard	The Minnesota National Guard is composed of approximately 14,000 soldiers of the Minnesota Army National Guard and Airmen of the Minnesota Air National Guard, serving in 63 communities across the state. The Constitution of the United States specifically charges the National Guard with dual federal and state missions. The National Guard is the only United States military force empowered to function in a state status. Those functions range from limited actions during non-emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of martial law when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control. The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the President or Congress.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Seal_of_the_Minnesota_National_Guard.svg/200px-Seal_of_the_Minnesota_National_Guard.svg.png
