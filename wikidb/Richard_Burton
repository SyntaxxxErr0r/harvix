103.0	Richard_Burton	Richard Burton	Richard Burton, CBE (10 November 1925 â€“ 5 August 1984) was a Welsh actor. He was nominated seven times for an Academy Award, six of which were for Best Actor in a Leading Role (without ever winning), and was a recipient of BAFTA, Golden Globe and Tony Awards for Best Actor. Although never trained as an actor, Burton was, at one time, the highest-paid actor in Hollywood. He remains closely associated in the public consciousness with his second wife, actress Elizabeth Taylor; the couple's turbulent relationship was rarely out of the news.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Burton%2C_Richard_%28Cleopatra%29.jpg/220px-Burton%2C_Richard_%28Cleopatra%29.jpg
