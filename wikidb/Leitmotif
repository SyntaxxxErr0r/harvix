62.6	Leitmotif	Leitmotif	A leitmotif ( ), sometimes written leit-motif, is a musical term (though occasionally used in theatre or literature), referring to a recurring theme, associated with a particular person, place, or idea. It is closely related to the musical idea of id√©e fixe. The term itself comes from the German Leitmotiv, literally meaning "leading motif", or, perhaps more accurately, "guiding motif."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Siegfriedleitmotif1.jpg/300px-Siegfriedleitmotif1.jpg
