59.9	E_pluribus_unum	E pluribus unum	E pluribus unum — Latin for "Out of many, one" (alternatively translated as "One from many") — is a phrase on the Seal of the United States, along with Annuit cœptis and Novus ordo seclorum, and adopted by an Act of Congress in 1782. Never codified by law, E pluribus unum was considered a de facto motto of the United States until 1956 when the United States Congress passed an act (H.J. Resolution 396), adopting "In God We Trust" as the official motto.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/US-GreatSeal-Obverse.svg/220px-US-GreatSeal-Obverse.svg.png
