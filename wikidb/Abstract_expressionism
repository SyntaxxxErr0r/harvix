102.0	Abstract_expressionism	Abstract expressionism	Abstract expressionism was an American postâ€“World War II art movement. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York City at the center of the western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term "abstract expressionism" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates, it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine Der Sturm, regarding German Expressionism. In the United States, Alfred Barr was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by Wassily Kandinsky.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/No._5%2C_1948.jpg/220px-No._5%2C_1948.jpg
