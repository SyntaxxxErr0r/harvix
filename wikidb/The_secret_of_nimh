O'Brien's 1971 children's novel Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH. The film was produced by Aurora Pictures and released by United Artists. While released to critical acclaim, The Secret of NIMH was also a moderate box office success. The film was followed in 1998 by a direct-to-video sequel called The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue, which was made without Bluth's input or consent.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/The_Secret_of_NIMH.jpg/220px-The_Secret_of_NIMH.jpg
