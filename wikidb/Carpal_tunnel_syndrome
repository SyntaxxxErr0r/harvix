96.3	Carpal_tunnel_syndrome	Carpal tunnel syndrome	Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment median neuropathy, causing paresthesia, pain, numbness, and other symptoms in the distribution of the median nerve due to its compression at the wrist in the carpal tunnel. The pathophysiology is not completely understood but can be considered compression of the median nerve traveling through the carpal tunnel. The National Center for Biotechnology Information and highly cited older literature say the most common cause of CTS is typing. More recent research by Lozano-Calder√≥n has cited genetics as a larger factor than use, and has encouraged caution in ascribing causality.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Carpal-Tunnel.svg/230px-Carpal-Tunnel.svg.png
