1.00	Anasagasti	Anasagasti	The Anasagasti was the first automobile to be built in Argentina; it was manufactured by Horacio Anasagasti of Buenos Aires from 1912 to 1914. Anasagasti's first vehicle was a 15 horsepower (11 kW) Ballot-engined car. In 1912-13 he entered cars built to his design in Europe; a team of the cars competed in the 1912 Tour de France, while a lone Picker-engined racer was entered in the 1913 Coupe de l'Auto. Anasagasti then returned home to Argentina, where he is believed to have built about 50 touring models.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Anasagasti01.jpg/220px-Anasagasti01.jpg
