Selecting the DE parameters that yield good performance has therefore been the subject of much research. Rules of thumb for parameter selection were devised by Storn et al. and Liu and Lampinen . Mathematical convergence analysis regarding parameter selection was done by Zaharie . Meta-optimization of the DE parameters was done by Pedersen and Zhang et al..	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/DE_Meta-Fitness_Landscape_%28Sphere_and_Rosenbrock%29.JPG/220px-DE_Meta-Fitness_Landscape_%28Sphere_and_Rosenbrock%29.JPG
