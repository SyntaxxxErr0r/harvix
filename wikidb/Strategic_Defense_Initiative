108.7	Strategic_Defense_Initiative	Strategic Defense Initiative	The Strategic Defense Initiative was proposed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1983, to use ground- and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD). The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the United States Department of Defense to oversee the Strategic Defense Initiative.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Sdilogo.svg/140px-Sdilogo.svg.png
