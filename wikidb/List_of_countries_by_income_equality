96.7	List_of_countries_by_income_equality	List of countries by income equality	This is a list of countries or dependencies by income inequality metrics, including Gini coefficients, according to the United Nations (UN), the World Bank, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the OECD. Note that because the underlying household surveys differ in method and in the type of data collected, the distribution data are not strictly comparable across countries. The Gini coefficient is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds with perfect equality (where everyone has the same income) and 1 corresponds with perfect inequality (where one person has all the income â€” and everyone else has zero income). Income distribution can vary greatly from wealth distribution in a country. See: List of countries by distribution of wealth. Income from Black Market economic activity is not included and is the subject of current economic research.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Gini_Coefficient_World_CIA_Report_2009.png/350px-Gini_Coefficient_World_CIA_Report_2009.png
