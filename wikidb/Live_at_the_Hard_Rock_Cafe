2.00	Live_at_the_Hard_Rock_Cafe	Live at the Hard Rock Cafe	Live at the Hard Rock Cafe is the second live DVD released by UK singer Melanie C. Filmed October 9th 2008 at Hard Rock Cafe Manchester, it features Melanie performing a selection of songs from her four albums. Fans from all over the world came not only to see Melanie perform, but also to help raise money for Hard Rock Cafe's yearly fundraiser, Pinktober. Already five months pregnant, Melanie performed a selection of her greatest hits along with some personal favourites during a 75 minute set. Filmed with just three camcorders, this film captures the raw intensity of this special acoustic event. Just 1750 copies were pressed and the DVD was only available through her official online store. All proceeds from this limited edition DVD were donated to the Caron Keating Foundation.
