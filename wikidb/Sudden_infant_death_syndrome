93.7	Sudden_infant_death_syndrome	Sudden infant death syndrome	Sudden infant death syndrome is marked by the sudden death of an infant that is not predicted by medical history and remains unexplained after a thorough forensic autopsy and detailed death scene investigation. As infants are at the highest risk for SIDS during sleep, it is sometimes referred to as cot death or crib death. The cause of SIDS is unknown, but some characteristics associated with the syndrome have been identified. The unique signature characteristic of SIDS is its log-normal age distribution that spares infants shortly after birth â€” the time of maximal risk for almost all other causes of non-trauma infant death. Other notable characteristics are its disproportionate affliction of male infants and the fact that caregivers are unaware in the preceding 24 hours that the infant is at risk of imminent sudden death. Many risk factors and medical causal relationships are proposed for SIDS. Infants sleeping prone or exposed to tobacco smoke are at greater risk than infants sleeping supine or unexposed to tobacco smoke, respectively. Genetics also play a role, as SIDS is more prevalent in males. SIDS prevention strategies include a well-ventilated sleeping room and putting infants on their back to sleep. Pacifiers and tummy time can help reduce known risk factors. Despite the gradual expansion of medical knowledge on SIDS causes and risk factors, definitive diagnosis remains difficult; infanticide and child abuse cases may be misdiagnosed as SIDS due to lack of evidence, and caretakers of SIDS victims are sometimes falsely accused of foul play. Accidental suffocations are also sometimes misdiagnosed as SIDS.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Back_to_sleep_plot.png/220px-Back_to_sleep_plot.png
