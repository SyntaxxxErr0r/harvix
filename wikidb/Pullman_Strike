66.4	Pullman_Strike	Pullman Strike	The Pullman Strike was a nationwide conflict between labor unions and railroads that occurred in the United States in 1894. The conflict began in the town of Pullman, Illinois on May 11 when approximately 3,000 employees of the Pullman Palace Car Company began a wildcat strike in response to recent reductions in wages, bringing traffic west of Chicago to a halt. The American Railway Union, the nation's first industry-wide union, led by Eugene V. Debs, subsequently became embroiled in what The New York Times described as "a struggle between the greatest and most important labor organization and the entire railroad capital" that involved some 250,000 workers in 27 states at its peak.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Pullman_strikers_outside_Arcade_Building.jpg/250px-Pullman_strikers_outside_Arcade_Building.jpg
