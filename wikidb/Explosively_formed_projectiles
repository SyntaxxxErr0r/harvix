3.00	Explosively_formed_projectiles	Explosively formed penetrator	An explosively formed penetrator , also known as an explosively formed projectile, a self-forging warhead, or a self-forging fragment, is a special type of shaped charge designed to penetrate armour effectively at standoff distances. As the name suggests, the effect of the explosive charge is to deform a metal plate into a slug or rod shape and accelerate it toward a target. They were first developed during WWII.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Explosively_formed_penetrator.gif/220px-Explosively_formed_penetrator.gif
