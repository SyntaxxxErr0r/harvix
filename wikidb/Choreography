56.3	Choreography	Choreography	Choreography is the art of designing sequences of movements in which motion, form, or both are specified. Choreography may also refer to the design itself, which is sometimes expressed by means of dance notation. The word choreography literally means "dance-writing" from the Greek words "χορεία" (circular dance, see choreia) and "γραφή" (writing). A choreographer is one who creates choreographies.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Bayadere_-Stepanov_Choreographic_Notation_-circa_1900.jpg/275px-Bayadere_-Stepanov_Choreographic_Notation_-circa_1900.jpg
