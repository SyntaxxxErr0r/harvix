4.00	Ciliates	Ciliate	The ciliates are a group of protozoans characterized by the presence of hair-like organelles called cilia, which are identical in structure to eukaryotic flagella, but typically shorter and present in much larger numbers with a different undulating pattern than flagella. Cilia occur in all members of the group (although the peculiar Suctoria only have them for part of the life-cycle) and are variously used in swimming, crawling, attachment, feeding, and sensation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Haeckel_Ciliata.jpg/220px-Haeckel_Ciliata.jpg
