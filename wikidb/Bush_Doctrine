104.3	Bush_Doctrine	Bush Doctrine	The Bush Doctrine is a phrase used to describe various related foreign policy principles of former United States president George W. Bush. The phrase was first used by Charles Krauthammer in June 2001 to describe the Bush Administration's unilateral withdrawals from the ABM treaty and the Kyoto Protocol. The phrase initially described the policy that the United States had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/BUSHPC2.jpg/280px-BUSHPC2.jpg
