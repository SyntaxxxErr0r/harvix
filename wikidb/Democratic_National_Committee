66.4	Democratic_National_Committee	Democratic National Committee	The Democratic National Committee is the principal organization governing the United States Democratic Party on a day to day basis. While it is responsible for overseeing the process of writing a platform every four years, the DNC's central focus is on campaign and political activity in support of Democratic Party candidates, and not on public policy. The DNC was established at the 1848 Democratic National Convention.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/US_Democratic_Party_Logo.svg/150px-US_Democratic_Party_Logo.svg.png
