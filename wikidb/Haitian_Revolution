58.5	Haitian_Revolution	Haitian Revolution	The Haitian Revolution (1791â€“1804) was a period of conflict in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which culminated in the elimination of slavery there and the founding of the Haitian republic. The revolution was one of the two successful attempts, along with the American Revolution, to achieve permanent independence from a European colonial power for an American state before the 19th century. Furthermore it is generally considered the most successful slave rebellion ever to have occurred in the Americas and as a defining moment in the history of Africans in the New World.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/San_Domingo.jpg/300px-San_Domingo.jpg
