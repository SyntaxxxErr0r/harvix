2.00	Lorna_Cartwright	Lorna Cartwright	Lorna Cartwright is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Janet Dibley intermittently between 1997 and 1998. Lorna was introduced primarily as a catalyst to break up the marriage of the characters Phil and Kathy Mitchell (played by Steve McFadden and Gillian Taylforth). Although producers reportedly wanted to develop the character further, actress Janet Dibley declined their offer of an extended contract, as she disagreed with a proposed storyline that would see Lorna gang raped.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Lorna_cartwright.jpg/200px-Lorna_cartwright.jpg
