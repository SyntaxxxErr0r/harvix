1.00	Workin'_It_Back	Workin' It Back	Workin' It Back was the tenth album by R&amp;B/Soul crooner Teddy Pendergrass. It was his second record for Asylum Records, once a longtime artist on Philadelphia International Records. The album didn't do nearly as well on the Billboard 200 as his last record, only peaking at #96, although it did reach US R&amp;B #6, only two spots lower than his previous album. The album spawned two singles, "Love 4/2" (#6 R&amp;B) and "Let Me Be Closer" (#67 R&amp;B), though none made the Billboard Hot 100.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Workingitback.jpg/220px-Workingitback.jpg
