80.7	The_Day_the_Music_Died	The Day the Music Died	On February 3, 1959, a small-plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa, killed three American rock and roll pioneers: Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson, as well as the pilot, Roger Peterson. The day was later called The Day the Music Died by Don McLean, in his song "American Pie". The plane crash has been called the first and greatest tragedy rock and roll has ever suffered.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/HollyMonument.jpg/200px-HollyMonument.jpg
