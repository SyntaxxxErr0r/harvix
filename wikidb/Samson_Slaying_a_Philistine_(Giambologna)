It was commissioned in about 1562, by Francesco de Medici for a fountain in Florence, but was later sent as a gift to Spain. The group was presented to the Prince of Wales, later King Charles I, in 1623 while he was in Spain negotiating a marriage contract, and it soon became the most famous Italian sculpture in England. On its arrival in England it was given to the king's favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, and subsequently changed hands three times before coming to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1954.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Samson_slaying_a_philistine.jpg/220px-Samson_slaying_a_philistine.jpg
