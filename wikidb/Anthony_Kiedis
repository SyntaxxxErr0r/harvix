72.3	Anthony_Kiedis	Anthony Kiedis	Anthony Kiedis ( -diss; born November 1, 1962) is an American vocalist/lyricist, and occasional actor best known as the lead vocalist of the Grammy-winning and 2012 Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame inductees, Red Hot Chili Peppers. Kiedis spent his youth in Grand Rapids, Michigan with his mother before moving, shortly before his 12th birthday, to Hollywood, California to live with his father. After high school, Kiedis began taking classes at UCLA, but dropped out after losing interest because he was unable to make any close friends during his time there. After dropping out, Kiedis received an offer to be the opening act for a local band, and enlisted friends Flea, Hillel Slovak, and Jack Irons to assist. After a show under the name "Tony Flow and the Miraculous Masters of Mayhem" the band progressed and the line-up eventually became the Red Hot Chili Peppers.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Anthony_Kiedis_2006_Oxegen.jpg/220px-Anthony_Kiedis_2006_Oxegen.jpg
