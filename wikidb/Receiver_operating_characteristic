52.4	Receiver_operating_characteristic	Receiver operating characteristic	In signal detection theory, a receiver operating characteristic , or simply ROC curve, is a graphical plot of the sensitivity, or true positive rate, vs. false positive rate (one minus the specificity or true negative rate), for a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC can also be represented equivalently by plotting the fraction of true positives out of the positives (TPR = true positive rate) vs. the fraction of false positives out of the negatives (FPR = false positive rate). The ROC is also known as a Relative Operating Characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR &amp; FPR) as the criterion changes.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Roccurves.png/220px-Roccurves.png
