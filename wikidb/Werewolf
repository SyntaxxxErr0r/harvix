58.1	Werewolf	Werewolf	A werewolf, also known as a lycanthrope (from the Greek : Template:Lan, lukos, "wolf", and , anthr≈çpos, "man"), is a mythological or folkloric human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or an anthropomorphic wolf-like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a curse and/or lycanthropic affliction via a bite or scratch from a werewolf, or some other means. This transformation is often associated with the appearance of the full moon, as popularly noted by the medieval chronicler Gervase of Tilbury, and perhaps in earlier times among the ancient Greeks through the writings of Petronius.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Loup-garou.jpg/220px-Loup-garou.jpg
