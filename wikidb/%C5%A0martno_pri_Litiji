1.10	%C5%A0martno_pri_Litiji	Šmartno pri Litiji	Šmartno pri Litiji is a town and a municipality in central Slovenia. It is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Central Slovenian statistical region. The town itself is located 3 km southeast of Litija at the confluence of three creeks: Reka, Črni potok and Kostrevniški potok. The town of Litija outgrew the formerly more important Šmartno when the Austrian Southern Railway was routed through Litija. The name of the settlement is first attested in ecclesiastical documents from 1135, although the area was already settled in prehistoric times. The oldest house in Šmartno pri Litiji bears the year 1580, and in the 17th century the Mollerey painting and graphic arts workshop operated in it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Smartno-Litija-SvMartin-slovenio.jpg/250px-Smartno-Litija-SvMartin-slovenio.jpg
