While there were entrepreneurs with the vision of an intercity network of lines, such as those through the East Midlands, it was much easier to find investors to back shorter stretches that were clearly defined in purpose, where rapid returns on investment could be predicted.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Opening_Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.jpg/220px-Opening_Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.jpg
