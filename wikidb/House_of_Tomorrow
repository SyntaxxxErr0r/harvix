3.00	House_of_Tomorrow	House of Tomorrow	The House of Tomorrow at 241 West Lake Front Drive, Beverly Shores, Indiana, was originally part of Chicago's 1933-34 Century of Progress Exposition. Designed as the house of the future, this house included its own airplane hangar. Glass walls offered views from every angle and so taxed the experimental air conditioning system that the cooling system failed.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/571531cv.jpg/250px-571531cv.jpg
