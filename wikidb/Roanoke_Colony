52.4	Roanoke_Colony	Roanoke Colony	The Roanoke Colony on Roanoke Island in Dare County, present-day North Carolina, United States was a late 16th-century attempt to establish a permanent English settlement in what later became the Virginia Colony. The enterprise was financed and organized by Sir Walter Raleigh and carried out by Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville, Raleigh's distant cousin. The final group of colonists disappeared during the Anglo-Spanish War, three years after the last shipment of supplies from England. The settlement is known as "The Lost Colony," and the fate of the colonists has never been determined.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Roanoke_map_1584.JPG/250px-Roanoke_map_1584.JPG
