34.76	Lachlan_Macquarie	Lachlan Macquarie	Major-General Lachlan Macquarie CB (31 January 1762 â€“ 1 July 1824) , was a Scottish British army officer and colonial administrator. He served as the last autocratic Governor of New South Wales, Australia from 1810 to 1821 and had a leading role in the social, economic and architectural development of the colony. He is considered by some historians to have had a crucial influence on the transition of New South Wales from a penal colony to a free settlement and therefore to have played a major role in the shaping of Australian society in the early nineteenth century. An inscription on his tomb in Scotland describes him as "The Father of Australia".	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Ln-Governor-Lachlan_macquarie.jpg/220px-Ln-Governor-Lachlan_macquarie.jpg
