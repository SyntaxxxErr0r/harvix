55.4	New_York_Dolls	New York Dolls	The New York Dolls is an American rock band, formed in New York in 1971. The band's protopunk sound prefigured much of what was to come in the punk rock era; their visual style influenced the look of many new wave and 1980s-era glam metal groups, and they began the local New York scene that later spawned the Ramones, Blondie, Television and Talking Heads.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/New_York_Dolls_%282006%29.jpg/250px-New_York_Dolls_%282006%29.jpg
