1.30	Musicovery	Musicovery	Musicovery is an interactive and customised webradio service. Listeners rate songs, resulting in a personalized programme. Reviewers have commented that unlike services that are governed by the user's choice of artist or genre, this method results in more discovery of artists to which the user might not otherwise have been exposed; The Washington Post's reviewer gave the example of "segueing from a West Coast R&amp;B band to a folk–rock group from Algeria".Musicovery provides dance mix — with the ability to specify the desired dance tempo — and similar artist features, as well as the option of a low fidelity free service or a premium service with better sound. Users have the option to limit the selection to a specific year or range of years, as well as to deselect any genre, and genres are color-keyed to the graphic interface. At least one U.S. newspaper reported that major advertising agency JWT listed Musicovery on its 2007 list of "80 things to watch in 2008," a list of trends and new products and services; however, the article does not indicate whether the agency had any business relationship with companies on the list.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Musicovery.JPG/250px-Musicovery.JPG
