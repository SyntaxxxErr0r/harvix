63.7	Transit-oriented_development	Transit-oriented development	A transit-oriented development is a mixed-use residential or commercial area designed to maximize access to public transport, and often incorporates features to encourage transit ridership. A TOD neighborhood typically has a center with a transit station or stop (train station, metro station, tram stop, or bus stop), surrounded by relatively high-density development with progressively lower-density development spreading outward from the center. TODs generally are located within a radius of one-quarter to one-half mile (400 to 800 m) from a transit stop, as this is considered to be an appropriate scale for pedestrians.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/ArlingtonTODimage3.jpg/300px-ArlingtonTODimage3.jpg
