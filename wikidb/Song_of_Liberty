1.00	Song_of_Liberty	Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty	"Quiet in Heaven" and "Song of Liberty" are two songs released together as a double single and is the only official release by Faith No Man (stylised as Faith. No Man.), before the majority of their members quit and formed Faith No More. The single has been long out of print, making it very difficult to find. The artwork, which was credited to Mike Morris; amongst other things, features an edited picture of Hitler wearing a tutu on the A-side of the disc and a track listing on the B-side with a pale grey slipcase.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/Faith_No_Man_Song_of_Liberty.jpg/220px-Faith_No_Man_Song_of_Liberty.jpg
