197.4	Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge	Samuel Taylor Coleridge	Samuel Taylor Coleridge (21 October 1772 â€“ 25 July 1834) was an English poet, Romantic, literary critic and philosopher who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was a founder of the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets. He is probably best known for his poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, as well as for his major prose work Biographia Literaria. His critical work, especially on Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture. He coined many familiar words and phrases, including the celebrated suspension of disbelief. He was a major influence, via Emerson, on American transcendentalism.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/SamuelTaylorColeridge.jpg/220px-SamuelTaylorColeridge.jpg
