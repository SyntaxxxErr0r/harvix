1.00	Angola%E2%80%93Cuba_relations	Angolaâ€“Cuba relations	Angola-Cuba diplomatic relations refers to the historical and current bilateral relationship between Angola and Cuba. During Angola's civil war Cuban forces fought to install a Marxist-Leninist MPLA-PT government; against Western-backed UNITA and FLNA guerrillas and South-African regular army. The present day outcome of the war resulted in the MPLA changing from a Marxist-Leninist party to a Multi-Party Democratic system based on Capitalistic principles (the MPLA also dropped the "PT" extension to their name as a clear sign of dropping their Communist aspirations). From an economic stand point, Cuba has lost its preferred status among Angolans and South Africa has become the biggest single investor and trading partner with Angola (outside of oil sales).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Angola_Cuba_Locator.png/250px-Angola_Cuba_Locator.png
