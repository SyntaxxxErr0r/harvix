By the time the human reaches adulthood, the body consists of close to 100 trillion cells, the basic unit of life. These cells are organised biologically to eventually form the whole body.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Anterior_view_of_human_female_and_male%2C_with_labels.jpg/300px-Anterior_view_of_human_female_and_male%2C_with_labels.jpg
