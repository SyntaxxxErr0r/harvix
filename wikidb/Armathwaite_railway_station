1.00	Armathwaite_railway_station	Armathwaite railway station	Armathwaite railway station is a railway station which serves the village of Armathwaite in Cumbria, England. It is operated by Northern Rail, which provides all passenger-train services. It is now, since the closure of Cotehill (1952), Cumwhinton (1956) and Scotby (1942) stations, the final stop on the Settle-Carlisle Line before the terminus at Carlisle. It was opened in May 1876, closed in May 1970 when local passenger trains ceased on the route and reopened in July 1986. By then, the original station building had been sold for private use so a passenger shelter was built at the other end of the platform.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/The_Citadel_Express_at_Armathwaite_railway_station_in_1978.jpg/265px-The_Citadel_Express_at_Armathwaite_railway_station_in_1978.jpg
