The park, managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, is notable for its .25-mile (0.40 km) long, 70-foot (21 m) deep chasm of granite bedrock featuring abrupt precipices and boulder caves in which ice lingers into the early summer. The reservation is open to picnicking and hiking; rock climbing is allowed by special permit only. Purgatory Chasm was declared a state park in 1919.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Purgatory_chasm_view_2.jpg/284px-Purgatory_chasm_view_2.jpg
