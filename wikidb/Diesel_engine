126.3	Diesel_engine	Diesel engine	A diesel engine (also known as a compression-ignition engine) is an internal combustion engine that uses the heat of compression to initiate ignition to burn the fuel, which is injected into the combustion chamber. This is in contrast to spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine (gasoline engine) or gas engine (using a gaseous fuel as opposed to gasoline), which uses a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture. The engine was developed by Rudolf Diesel in 1893.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Tatra018.jpg/220px-Tatra018.jpg
