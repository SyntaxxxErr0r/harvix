1.00	Kikkawa_clan	Kikkawa family	The Kikkawa family (吉川氏) was a samurai clan of Japan's Sengoku period. The most famous member of the clan is likely Kikkawa Motoharu (1530-1586), one of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's generals, who was adopted into the family. Along with the Kobayakawa clan, the Kikkawa played an important role in Hideyoshi's Kyūshū Campaign (1586-7), and later became daimyo in Izumo province and Iwakuni after that.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Marunouchinimitsuhikiryo.svg/220px-Marunouchinimitsuhikiryo.svg.png
