1.00	Quantum_cascade_lasers	Quantum cascade laser	Within a bulk semiconductor crystal, electrons may occupy states in one of two continuous energy bands - the valence band, which is heavily populated with low energy electrons and the conduction band, which is sparsely populated with high energy electrons. The two energy bands are separated by an energy band gap in which there are no permitted states available for electrons to occupy. Conventional semiconductor laser diodes generate light by a single photon being emitted when a high energy electron in the conduction band recombines with a hole in the valence band. The energy of the photon and hence the emission wavelength of laser diodes is therefore determined by the band gap of the material system used.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Interband_optical_transition.svg/170px-Interband_optical_transition.svg.png
