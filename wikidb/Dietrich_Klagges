3.10	Dietrich_Klagges	Dietrich Klagges	A short time after the Nazis' seizure of power, the first acts of terror were seen in both the City and Province of Braunschweig in which the so-called "Hilfspolizei" ("Auxiliary Police") stood out. This force was directly answerable to Klagges and consisted of SA, SS and "Stahlhelm" men. Their actions were aimed mainly at members of various labour organizations, the SPD, the KPD, and also against Jews. They were carried out with extraordinary brutality. Klagges was therefore responsible for at least 25 Nazi r√©gime opponents' deaths. The murder of eleven communists and labour organisers in Rieseberg (about 15 miles east of Braunschweig) by members of the SS on 4 July 1933 was the most important of these events. There was to have been a judicial inquiry into the circumstances of the arrestees' deaths, but Klagges assisted in blocking and suppressing it.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Braunschweig_Brunswick_AOK-Gebaeude_%282006%29.jpg/240px-Braunschweig_Brunswick_AOK-Gebaeude_%282006%29.jpg
