294.3	Fuel_cell	Fuel cell	A fuel cell is a device that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen or another oxidizing agent. Hydrogen is the most common fuel, but hydrocarbons such as natural gas and alcohols like methanol are sometimes used. Fuel cells are different from batteries in that they require a constant source of fuel and oxygen to run, but they can produce electricity continually for as long as these inputs are supplied.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Fuel_cell_NASA_p48600ac.jpg/250px-Fuel_cell_NASA_p48600ac.jpg
