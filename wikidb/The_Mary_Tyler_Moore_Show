Brooks and Allan Burns that aired on CBS from 1970 to 1977. The program was a television breakthrough, with the first never-married, independent career woman as the central character: "As Mary Richards, a single woman in her thirties, Moore presented a character different from other single TV women of the time. She was not widowed or divorced or seeking a man to support her."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show_title_card.jpg/235px-Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show_title_card.jpg
