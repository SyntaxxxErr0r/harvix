23.44	Thermoforming	Thermoforming	Thermoforming is a manufacturing process where a plastic sheet is heated to a pliable forming temperature, formed to a specific shape in a mold, and trimmed to create a usable product. The sheet, or "film" when referring to thinner gauges and certain material types, is heated in an oven to a high-enough temperature that it can be stretched into or onto a mold and cooled to a finished shape.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Thermoforming.gif/200px-Thermoforming.gif
