93.7	Francis_Fukuyama	Francis Fukuyama	Yoshihiro Francis Fukuyama (born October 27, 1952) is an American political scientist, political economist, and author. He is a Senior Fellow at the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at Stanford. Before that he served as a professor and director of the International Development program at the School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University. He is best known for his book The End of History and the Last Man (1992), which argued that the worldwide spread of liberal democracies may signal the end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and become the final form of human government. Fukuyama is also associated with the rise of the neoconservative movement, from which he has since distanced himself.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Francis_Fukuyama_2005.jpg/220px-Francis_Fukuyama_2005.jpg
