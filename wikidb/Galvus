3.00	Galvus	Vildagliptin	Vildagliptin (previously identified as LAF237, trade names Zomelis, Galvus) is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent of the new dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class of drugs. Vildagliptin inhibits the inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP by DPP-4, allowing GLP-1 and GIP to potentiate the secretion of insulin in the beta cells and suppress glucagon release by the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Vildagliptin_Structural_Formulae.png/220px-Vildagliptin_Structural_Formulae.png
