8.31	Carboxypeptidase	Carboxypeptidase	A carboxypeptidase (EC number 3.4.16 - 3.4.18) is a protease enzyme that hydrolyzes (cleaves) the peptide bond of an amino acid residue at the carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) end. (Contrast with an aminopeptidase, which cleaves peptide bonds at the other end of the residue.) Humans, animals, and plants contain several types of carboxypeptidases that have diverse functions ranging from catabolism to protein maturation.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Carboxypeptidase_A.png/220px-Carboxypeptidase_A.png
