72.5	Pulse-code_modulation	Pulse-code modulation	Pulse-code modulation is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals. It is the standard form for digital audio in computers and various Blu-ray, DVD and Compact Disc formats, as well as other uses such as digital telephone systems. A PCM stream is a digital representation of an analog signal, in which the magnitude of the analog signal is sampled regularly at uniform intervals, with each sample being quantized to the nearest value within a range of digital steps.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Pcm.svg/250px-Pcm.svg.png
