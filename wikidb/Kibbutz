89.1	Kibbutz	Kibbutz	A kibbutz is a collective community in Israel that was traditionally based on agriculture. Today, farming has been partly supplanted by other economic branches, including industrial plants and high-tech enterprises. Kibbutzim began as utopian communities, a combination of socialism and Zionism. In recent decades, some kibbutzim have been privatized and changes have been made in the communal lifestyle. A member of a kibbutz is called a kibbutznik (Hebrew: ‎‎).	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Kfar_Masaryk_6699.JPG/250px-Kfar_Masaryk_6699.JPG
