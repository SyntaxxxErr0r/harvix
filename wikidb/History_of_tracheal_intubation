The 110-page Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian medical papyrus which dates to circa 1550 BC, also makes reference to the tracheotomy. Tracheotomy was described in the Rigveda, a Sanskrit text of ayurvedic medicine written circa 2000 BC in ancient India. The text mentions "the bountiful one who, without a ligature, can cause the windpipe to re-unite when the cervical cartilages are cut across, provided they are not entirely severed." The Sushruta Samhita (circa 400 BC) is another text from the Indian subcontinent on ayurvedic medicine and surgery that mentions tracheotomy.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/Tracheotomy1.jpg
