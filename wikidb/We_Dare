3.00	We_Dare	We Dare	We Dare is an adult-oriented party video game by Ubisoft, for the Wii and PlayStation 3 gaming systems. It is marketed as a "sexy, quirky, party game" and involves kissing, striptease and spanking. However reviewers in countries where the game is available, such as Canada have noted that the game is in fact a relatively tame party game compilation with only very mild sexual connotations.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/15/We_Dare_Coverart.png
