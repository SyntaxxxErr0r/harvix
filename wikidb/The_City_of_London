18.42	The_City_of_London	City of London	The City of London is an area in central London, England. In the medieval period it constituted most of London, but the conurbation has grown far beyond it. As the Cityâ€™s boundaries have remained almost unchanged since the Middle Ages, it is now only a tiny part of the metropolis, though it remains a notable part of central London and holds city status in its own right.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/London_from_the_air.jpg/260px-London_from_the_air.jpg
