1.00	Centre_Right	Centre-right	The centre-right is a political term commonly used to describe or denote individuals, political parties, or organizations (such as think tanks) whose views stretch from the centre to the right on the left-right spectrum, excluding far right stances. Centre-right can also describe a coalition of centrist and right-of-centre parties. Many political parties of the centre-right are known to have various factions and members who advocate right-of-centre policies, while others advocate more centrist political agendas. In recent years, for example, several centre-right parties have taken up environmentalism as part of their government platform while within others it remains a contentious debate (see the Republican Party ).
