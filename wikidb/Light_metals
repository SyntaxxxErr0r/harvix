2.00	Light_metals	Light metal	Light metals are metals of low atomic weight. The cut off between light metals and heavy metals varies. Lithium, beryllium, sodium, magnesium and aluminium are almost always included. Additional period 4 element metals up to nickel are often included as well. Metals heavier than nickel are usually called heavy metals. Light metals are generally less toxic than heavy metals. Beryllium is toxic, but it is rarely found in large concentrations. Vanadium, not always counted as a light metal, is also toxic. Other light metals are toxic in large amounts.
