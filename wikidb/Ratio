51.4	Ratio	Ratio	In mathematics, a ratio is a relationship between two numbers of the same kind . In layman's terms a ratio represents, simply, for every amount of one thing, how much there is of another thing. For example, suppose I have 10 pairs of socks for every pair of shoes then the ratio of shoes:socks would be 1:10 and the ratio of socks:shoes would be 10:1	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Aspect-ratio-4x3.svg/220px-Aspect-ratio-4x3.svg.png
