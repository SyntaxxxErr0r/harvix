62.9	Biblical_Magi	Biblical Magi	The phrase from the east (ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν), more literally from the rising , is the only information Matthew provides about the region from which they came. Traditionally the view developed that they were Babylonians, Persians, or Jews from Yemen as the Makrebs or kings of Yemen then were Jews, a view held for example by John Chrysostom. The majority belief was they were from Babylon, which was the centre of Zurvanism, and hence astrology, at the time; and may have retained knowledge from the time of their Jewish leadership by Daniel. There is an Armenian tradition identifying the 'Magi of Bethlehem' as Balthasar of Arabia, Melchior of Persia and Gaspar of India. Bible historian Chuck Missler has also written about this tradition. Historian John of Hildesheim states about a tradition in the ancient silk road city of Taxila (near Islamabad in Pakistan) that one of the Magi passed through the city on the way to Bethlehem.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/WiseMenAdorationMurillo.png/270px-WiseMenAdorationMurillo.png
