127.6	Pair_programming	Pair programming	Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, types in code while the other, the observer (or navigator), reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Pair_programming_1.jpg/330px-Pair_programming_1.jpg
