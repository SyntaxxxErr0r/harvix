8.02	Twisted-pair	Twisted pair	Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors (the forward and return conductors of a single circuit) are twisted together for the purposes of canceling out electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources; for instance, electromagnetic radiation from unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables, and crosstalk between neighboring pairs. It was invented by Alexander Graham Bell.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/25_pair_color_code_chart.svg/220px-25_pair_color_code_chart.svg.png
