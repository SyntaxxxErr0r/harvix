2.00	Slipstream_(Transformers)	Slipstream (Transformers)	In the Transformers Animated series, Slipstream is the name that was given to the female Starscream clone. Like the rest of the clones, Slipstream embodies a part of the original's personality, though what part that is has never been elaborated upon. In spite of being created by Starscream, Slipstream has zero respect towards him and is as vindictive in personality.
