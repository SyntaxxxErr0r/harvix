55.4	Heap_(data_structure)	Heap (data structure)	In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if B is a child node of A, then key â‰¥ key(B). This implies that an element with the greatest key is always in the root node, and so such a heap is sometimes called a max-heap. (Alternatively, if the comparison is reversed, the smallest element is always in the root node, which results in a min-heap.) The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap, but in many types it is at most two. The heap is one maximally-efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue. Heaps are crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, and in the sorting algorithm heapsort.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Max-Heap.svg/240px-Max-Heap.svg.png
