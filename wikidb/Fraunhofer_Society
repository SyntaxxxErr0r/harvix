35.84	Fraunhofer_Society	Fraunhofer Society	The Fraunhofer Society is a German research organization with 60 institutes spread throughout Germany, each focusing on different fields of applied science (as opposed to the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, which works primarily on basic science). It employs around 18,000, mainly scientists and engineers, with an annual research budget of about €1.65 billion. Some basic funding for the Fraunhofer Society is provided by the state (the German public, through federal government together with the German Länder, "owns" the Fraunhofer Society), but more than 70% of the funding is earned through contract work, either for government sponsored projects or from industry.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Stamp_Germany_1999_MiNr2038_Fraunhofer_Gesellschaft.jpg/220px-Stamp_Germany_1999_MiNr2038_Fraunhofer_Gesellschaft.jpg
