2.00	Sand_vein	Shrimp	Shrimp are swimming, decapod crustaceans classified in the infraorder Caridea, found widely around the world in both fresh and salt water. Adult shrimp are filter feeding benthic animals living close to the bottom. They can live in schools and can swim rapidly backwards. Shrimp are an important food source for larger animals from fish to whales. They have a high tolerance to toxins in polluted areas, and may contribute to high toxin levels in their predators. Together with prawns, shrimp are widely caught and farmed for human consumption.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Heterocarpus_ensifer.jpg/220px-Heterocarpus_ensifer.jpg
