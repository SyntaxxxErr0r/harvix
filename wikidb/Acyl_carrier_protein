2.30	Acyl_carrier_protein	Acyl carrier protein	The acyl carrier protein (ACP) is an important component in both fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis with the growing chain bound during synthesis as a thiol ester at the distal thiol of a 4'-phosphopantethiene moiety. The protein is expressed in the inactive apo form and the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety must be post-translationally attached to a conserved serine residue on the ACP by the action of holo-acyl carrier protein synthase (ACPS), a phosphopantetheinyl transferase.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Act_acp.png/220px-Act_acp.png
