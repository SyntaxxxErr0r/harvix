36.27	Statics	Statics	Statics is the branch of mechanics concerned with the analysis of loads on physical systems in static equilibrium, that is, in a state where the relative positions of subsystems do not vary over time, or where components and structures are at a constant velocity. When in static equilibrium, the system is either at rest, or its center of mass moves at constant velocity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Beam_in_static_equilibrium2.svg/220px-Beam_in_static_equilibrium2.svg.png
