1.10	Illmo,_Missouri	Illmo, Missouri	Illmo is an unincorporated community in Scott County, Missouri. It is next to Scott City. Its post office has closed and its mail now comes from Scott City. The community was founded in 1905 and its name is a contraction of Illinois and Missouri as the community is near Illinois and in Missouri. The town was created to support a major St. Louis Southwestern and Missouri Pacific railroad hub in the days of steam locomotives. The need for the railroad yard faded as the both railroads combined into Union Pacific. At one time, this huge yard, like Spencer, N.C., and many others, were busy day and night, and the romantic sounds of steam engines and switchers could be heard throughout the neighborhoods. The Thebes Bridge across the Mississippi was completed in 1905, and connected Illinois and Missouri, hence the name Illmo.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/MOMap-doton-Illmo.png
