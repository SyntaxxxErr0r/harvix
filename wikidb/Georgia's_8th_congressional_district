The district is currently represented by Republican Austin Scott, though the district's boundaries have been redrawn following the 2010 census, which granted an additional congressional seat to Georgia. The first election using the new district boundaries (listed below) will be the 2012 congressional elections.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/United_States_House_of_Representatives%2C_Georgia_District_08%2C_110th_Congress.png/300px-United_States_House_of_Representatives%2C_Georgia_District_08%2C_110th_Congress.png
