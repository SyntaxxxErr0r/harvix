72.6	First-mover_advantage	First-mover advantage	In marketing, first-mover advantage or FMA is the advantage gained by the initial ("first-moving") significant occupant of a market segment. It may be referred to as Technological Leadership. This advantage may stem from the fact that the first entrant can gain control of resources that followers may not be able to match. Sometimes the first mover is not able to capitalize on its advantage, leaving the opportunity for another firm to gain second-mover advantage.
